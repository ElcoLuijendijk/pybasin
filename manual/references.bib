abstract = {A new model for examining fission-track data from natural specimens has been developed on the basis of new laboratory data describing fission-track annealing in a wide variety of apatites and the empirical correction for fission-track length anisotropy presented in earlier papers. Using revised and simplified statistical methods, we examine how well various empirical equations are able to fit the laboratory data and reproduce expected behavior on geological time scales. Based on the latter criterion, we find that so-called “fanning Arrhenius” models of mean track length are not the bestsuited for our data. Instead, we find that fitting c-axis projected lengths with a model that incorporates some curvature on an Arrhenius plot produces results that are in better agreement with the available geological benchmarks. In examining the relative annealing behavior of apatites with different resistance to annealing, we find that the laboratory-time-scale behavior of any two apatites can be reproduced well by a simple one- or two-parameter equation. This function is used to convert the reduced fission-track length of one apatite that has undergone a certain time-temperature history into the length that would be measured in a second, less-resistant apatite that has undergone the same history. Using this conversion, we create a single model that encompasses the annealing behavior of all of the apatites we studied. The predictions made by this model match closely those made by fits to data for individual apatites. We therefore infer that, although the conversion equation is imperfect, it presents an excellent practical solution to characterizing the range of kinetic variability for annealing of fission tracks in apatite.},

abstract = {We performed a detailed analysis of the thermal state of the Cenozoic Roer Valley Graben, the north2013western branch of the European Cenozoic Rift System, based on a new set of temperature data. We developed a numerical technique for correcting bottom hole temperatures, including an evaluation of the uncertainty of thermal parameters.

The subsurface temperatures and the derived regional heat flow estimates of 53 � 6 to 63 � 6�mW�m22122 show no significant difference between the central rift and the adjacent structural highs. The absence of an elevated heat flow is attributed to the low amount of lithospheric thinning during the Cenozoic rifting phase (03B2=1.0620131.15). A local thermal anomaly exceeding +10��C was found in five wells in the north2013western part of the rift basin at depths of 100020131500�m, and is most likely caused by the upward flow of fluids along faults, whereas lower temperatures in the upper 1500�m in the southern part of the rift basin could indicate cooling by topography-driven groundwater flow. Conflicting ideas exist on the active or passive rifting mechanisms responsible for the formation of the different rift basins of European Cenozoic Rift System. The low spatial variation in heat flow found in this study suggests that the mechanism responsible for forming the Roer Valley Graben is passive rifting.},

abstract = {Two abiding issues impact the reliability of apatite Þ ssion-track analysis and thermal history inver- sion in particular: reproducibility of track-length measurements and variability of annealing kinetics. In the companion to this paper, we addressed the Þ rst by demonstrating that using c-axis projection to normalize track lengths for crystallographic angle improves reproducibility among measurements acquired by Barbarand et al. (2003a, 2003b). We continue here by looking at the effect of c-axis projection on extrapolation of laboratory measurements to geological time scales. We Þ nd that c-axis projection improves agreement between predictions of empirical annealing models Þ t to measurements by Barbarand et al. (2003b) analysts 1 and 3, further corroborating its effectiveness in ameliorating observer bias. Furthermore, these annealing models closely match predictions from the Carlson et al. (1999) annealing data set, which was obtained by a different analyst using a different etching protocol. Normalizing for angle thus allows us to create a single annealing model that encompasses both data sets and etching techniques. By combining the different compositional varieties of apatite in the two data sets, the resulting model provides an improved basis for estimating apatite kinetic properties in unknowns using proxies such as composition, etch-Þ gure dimension, and unit-cell parameters. Pre- dictions from a fanning curvilinear model form accord with conventional expectations of annealing at high and low temperatures, and its use for thermal history inversion will not introduce spurious late cooling events.},
