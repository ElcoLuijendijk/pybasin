annote = {In fission track analysis it is common to find that the true ages of different crystal grains vary within a sample, and this may be important for geological interpretation. There are at least two well-recognized geological processes that lead to mixed ages: grains from multiple sources, and differential annealing between grains of differing composition. Data from multiple sources may be represented statistically by a finite mixture model, usually with two or three components, but data arising from the multicompositional annealing process may be better modelled as an infinite mixture. We discuss finite mixtures and two new infinite mixture models: a random effects model whose parameters describe the location and spread of the population grain ages, and a more general model encompassing both two-component mixtures and random effects. We illustrate with case studies how to use these models to estimate various features of interest such as the minimum age, the other component ages and the age dispersion.},

@article{Green2006a,
abstract = {While initial studies showed a high degree of consistency between AFTA and apatite (U-Th)/He dating, an increasing number of studies are reporting apatite (U-Th)/He ages which are older than expected on the basis of apatite fission track data from the same region. We present data from a range of geological settings to document a systematic discrepancy between the two systems, which becomes more pronounced in samples with older fission track ages (except for samples with very low uranium contents). Results from a granite pebble and enclosing volcanogenic sandstone provide a well-controlled test case in which independent constraints are available on the underlying thermal history. These demonstrate that the progressive discrepancy between the two techniques arises not from anomalous fission track annealing behaviour, as has been suggested, but as a result of a change in the He retention properties of apatite. This change appears to be linked to the degree of accumulated radiation damage within the crystal lattice, although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We suggest detailed experiments should be performed to delineate and quantify the processes responsible. Until this is achieved, we suggest that apatite (U-Th)/He studies should also incorporate apatite fission track data, as well as other low temperature indicators, in order to monitor the (U-Th)/He system response and to guard against the anomalous behaviour described here.},

@article{Ketcham2007a,
abstract = {Apatite fission-track length data are used extensively for thermal history inversion. However, several studies have documented instances of poor reproducibility of length data. We address this problem by using c-axis projection to normalize track lengths for crystallographic angle in the extensive laboratory annealing data set acquired by Barbarand et al. (2003a, 2003b). A new simplification reduces the c-axis projection model from six to four fitted parameters. Normalizing for track angle using c-axis projection improves every aspect of length measurement reproducibility examined. It accelerates convergence of mean length in single analyses; increases consistency among replicate measurements by a single analyst; enhances consistency of measurements of the same mounts by different analysts; and improves the match between analyses conducted with and without Cf-irradiation. C-axis projection is also shown to enhance the thermal sensitivity of length data. Based on these results, we assert that c-axis projection is a good means of compensating for observer bias, although it does not overcome differences caused by experimental error.},

@article{Barbarand2001,
abstract = {The Southeast Basin in southern France is part of the north European continental margin of the Mezosoic Tethys. The original amount and extent of the Mesozoic sedimentary cover across this basin margin (formed from the Variscan Massif Central basement) is unknown and has been the subject of much debate. We have used apatite fission-track thermochronology to better understand Mesozoic sedimentation and later erosion histories of this region. Thirty-three outcrops and borehole samples were collected from Paleozoic granitic and metamorphic basement and Paleozoic and Triassic sandstones in broadly E-W transects. Except from a restricted area (Vivarais), measured fission-track ages are \textless130 Ma with mean track lengths between 10.7 and 13.8 [mu]m. Thermal histories based on fission-track age and length data are consistent with an episode of cooling that began at 130+/-10 Ma for the northern part of the study area and at 110+/-10 Ma for the southern part. This cooling is interpreted to be the result of denudation. The thickness of eroded rocks is estimated between 2000 and 2500 m, depending on the geothermal gradient and on the thermal conductivity of eroded rocks. The greatest amount of denudation occurred in the southern part of the study area. The presence of thin Triassic and Early Jurassic sediments preserved on the top of the Variscan basement implies that only a small part of the total thickness of eroded material corresponds to basement rocks. Paleogeographical data argue against a Triassic-Early Jurassic sedimentary cover thick enough to explain the recorded temperatures. This study suggests that the basement was buried beneath a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) sedimentary cover, which has been removed from mid-Cretaceous time. This interpretation differs strongly from earlier studies where the maximum onlap of the Southeast Basin deposits onto the basement was restricted to thin Early Jurassic rocks. Onset of denudation can be related to geodynamic events which affected southern France in mid-Cretaceous time, and that resulted from the opening of the Bay of Biscay (140-110 Ma).},

The sedimentary record of the clastic Miocene–Pliocene sequence deposited in the Fiambal{\'{a}} Basin, at the southern margin of the Puna Plateau (NW Argentina), documents the late Miocene paleodrainage evolution from headwaters to the west, towards headwaters in the ranges that constitute the border of the Puna Plateau to the north. Apatite Fission track (AFT) thermochronology of sedimentary and basement rocks show that the southern Puna Plateau was the source for the youngest, middle Miocene, detrital population detected in late Miocene rocks; and that the margin of the Puna Plateau expressed a high relief, possibly similar to or higher than at present, by late Miocene time. Cooling ages obtained from basement rocks at the southern Puna margin suggest that exhumation started in the Oligocene and continued until the middle Miocene. We interpret the basin reorganization and the creation of a high relief plateau margin to be the direct response of the source–basin system to a wholesale surface uplift event that may have occurred during the late Cenozoic in the Puna–Altiplano region. At this time coeval paleodrainage reorganization is observed not only in the Fiambal{\'{a}} Basin, but also in different basins along the southern and eastern Puna margin, suggesting a genetic link between the last stage of plateau formation and basin response. However, this event did not cause sufficient exhumation of basin bounding ranges to be recorded by AFT thermochronology. Our new data thus document a decoupling between late Cenozoic surface uplift and exhumation in the southern Puna Plateau.

abstract = {A new model for examining fission-track data from natural specimens has been developed on the basis of new laboratory data describing fission-track annealing in a wide variety of apatites and the empirical correction for fission-track length anisotropy presented in earlier papers. Using revised and simplified statistical methods, we examine how well various empirical equations are able to fit the laboratory data and reproduce expected behavior on geological time scales. Based on the latter criterion, we find that so-called “fanning Arrhenius” models of mean track length are not the bestsuited for our data. Instead, we find that fitting c-axis projected lengths with a model that incorporates some curvature on an Arrhenius plot produces results that are in better agreement with the available geological benchmarks. In examining the relative annealing behavior of apatites with different resistance to annealing, we find that the laboratory-time-scale behavior of any two apatites can be reproduced well by a simple one- or two-parameter equation. This function is used to convert the reduced fission-track length of one apatite that has undergone a certain time-temperature history into the length that would be measured in a second, less-resistant apatite that has undergone the same history. Using this conversion, we create a single model that encompasses the annealing behavior of all of the apatites we studied. The predictions made by this model match closely those made by fits to data for individual apatites. We therefore infer that, although the conversion equation is imperfect, it presents an excellent practical solution to characterizing the range of kinetic variability for annealing of fission tracks in apatite.},

abstract = {Description/Abstract	Uranium dosimeter glasses SRM 612, CN1 and CN2 have been calibrated against Co monitors in 79 irradiations in the Herald reactor over seven years. Comparison of relative responses of the four dosimeters reveals that unaccounted errors exist in the response of the Co monitors and, to a lesser extent, in the response of SRM 612. These results show that attempts to calibrate a uranium glass against an activation monitor in only a small number of irradiations may produce results radically discrepant from the true value. The importance of systematic errors in neutron dosimetry for fission-track dating is also discussed. An alternative zeta calibration approach is described, which circumvents absolute phi and lambdasub(f) evaluation: each dosimeter glass is calibrated repeatedly against zircon age standards from the Fish Canyon and Bishop tuffs, the Tardree rhyolite and Southern African kimberlites, to obtain empirical calibration factors zeta.},

abstract = {The ratio R of the densities of etchable fission tracks in a mineral and co-irradiated external detector is shown to depend on the length ratios of the latent (Lf/Lf') and etched fission tracks (Le/Le') in the two media. Calculations of Lf for apatite, titanite zircon and Lf' for muscovite external detectors allow a precise determination of R, and confirm that neglecting R could constitute the most significant source of systematic error in fission-track dating with the external detector method. The ratios of the measured fission-track densities in an external and internal surface of apatite and a muscovite external detector are calculated from R and the track counting efficiencies [eta]q. The fact that the results are consistent with the experiment supports the accuracy of R and of the [eta]q-factors. The external detector ages of a basal and prismatic section of Durango apatite are consistent with its reference age, without the need for a length correction. A critical examination of the uncertainties related to the thermal neutron fluence measurements, fission-decay constant, calculated R-value, independently determined [eta]q-factors and the reference age of the standard, demonstrates that the assumption that a reduction of the confined track length of the spontaneous tracks in Durango apatite necessitates a proportional correction of its apparent fission-track age is the element most in question. Published U/Th-He ages lend support to the conclusion that such a correction is not required. The significance of R and of the ratio Q of the [eta]q-factors for the induced and spontaneous track counts leads us to propose a formalisation of the age equation, in which these are included, as well as a formal length correction L, which is, however, not set equal to the ratio of the confined track lengths of the induced and spontaneous tracks. The accuracy of the thermal neutron fluence and the decay constant leads us to propose a possible deconvolution of the [zeta]-calibration factor. If, for suitable age standards L=1, the proposed deconvoluted calibration factor [zeta]0 is a function of R and Q, which can be determined in ways that are independent of the reference ages of the standards. This can either be interpreted as a multiple calibration or as establishing the fission-track method as an independent dating method.},

@article{Green1986,
annote = { Confined fission-track lengths have been used to study the degree of annealing of induced fission tracks in samples of a single fluorapatite crystal (Durango apatite), heated for various times (between 20 min. and 500 days) at temperatures between 95� and 400�C. In all annealed samples the mean confined track length is always less than that in unannealed control samples. As annealing progresses, the mean length is reduced and the length distribution broadens, slowly at first, and then more rapidly below a length reduction (l/l0) of \textasciitilde 0.65. In addition, the variation of track length with angle to the crystallographic c-axis becomes progressively more anisotropic. As the mean track length approaches zero, the only tracks left are aligned parallel to the c-acis. In heavily annealed samples (l/l0 \textless 0.65) observation of individual tracks after sequential etching steps shows the presence of unetchable "gaps" in a small proportion of tracks. The existence of these gaps is borne out by annealing studies of heavy-ion tracks in apatite slices. These studies also show the anisotropy characteristic of annealing in apatite. The annealing of fission tracks in apatite appears to be characterised by two processes. For small degrees of annealing the dominant process brings about a progressive shrinking of the track from each end, with tracks perpendicular to the c-axis shortening more rapidly than those parallel to it. As annealing becomes more severe (l/l0 \textless 0.65) the tracks begin to break up into discontinuous portions. Track length distributions in annealed apatites reflect the interplay of these processes. The effect of apatite composition on annealing has been studied using spontaneous tracks in apatites from a sample in which considerable geological annealing has occurred. Electron microprobe studies show that apatite grains rich in Cl are more resistant to annealing, while fluorapatite is more readily annealed.},

abstract = {A method is presented that permits the length of any horizontal, confined fission-track inclined at a specified angle to the crystallographic c axis in apatite to be converted to an equivalent track length parallel to the crystallographic c axis. The model is based on the results of annealing experiments for six selected apatites (five calcian fluorapatites and Durango apatite) representing a subset of the 15 total apatite specimens studied. An iterative process of calculation is required to project fission-track lengths onto the c axis and computer source code implementing the solution to this problem is presented. This method of projecting apatite fission-track lengths onto the crystallographic c axis is shown to remove effectively fission-track length variation within single fission-track populations due to anisotropic track-length reduction for all 15 apatites studied. In addition, a model is developed that offers predictions that closely reproduce published experimental data concerning the relationship between fission-track density (etched fission tracks per unit area of apatite surface) and the arithmetic mean fission-track length. Finally, it is shown that natural fission-track populations exhibit fission-track length anisotropy similar to that of fission-track populations created and annealed in the laboratory. This observation implies that the same process by which apatite fission tracks anneal in the laboratory is responsible for annealing of apatite fission tracks in the geological environment.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track analysis yields information on the thermal history of rocks for temperatures < 150�C. The effective closure temperature for fission tracks in apatite is $\sim$ 100�C, but recent developments in projected track length studies also allow us the dating of the $\sim$ 60�C cooling temperature. Projected track length measurements were carried out on apatites from the basement granites of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM), southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, where a previous study had revealed an uplifted, fossil partial annealing zone (PAZ). These measurements confirm the original conclusions reached, namely, that the break in slope in the apatite age profile represents the base of an uplifted PAZ. Furthermore this study provides a test case for not only the PAZ concept in interpretations of apatite age profiles, but also for the use of projected track lengths in determining the $\sim$ 60�C cooling temperature. It is therefore possible to locate the-position of the base and top of a fossil PAZ by use of the $\sim$ 100 and $\sim$ 60�C cooling ages. Model predictions of the PAZ concept for tectonics indicate that the break in slope, such as seen in the TAM, only approximates the onset of uplift. The true time of initiation of uplift was somewhat earlier because samples uplifted from near the base of the fossil PAZ are further annealed as they pass through the PAZ to the zone of full track stability.},

abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He and fission track age determinations of samples from a 20-km-long, near-horizontal tunnel in the Hochalm-Ankogel Dome (eastern Tauern Window, Austria) are presented in order to determine the role of (paleo)-topography in perturbing isotherms in the shallow crust. Apatite fission track ages (26–8 Ma) show no systematic correlation with distance along the tunnel or elevation. Two age components in the fission track data indicate cooling through ∼120�C at approximately 20 Ma and ∼80�C at approximately 6 Ma. Surface and tunnel (U-Th)/He ages (17–9 Ma and 13–5 Ma, respectively) are consistently younger than the equivalent fission track ages. (U-Th)/He ages vary systematically along the tunnel with older ages at the northern and southern tunnel portals and younger ages in the central section. Geological factors (faulting, lithology) appear to have had little effect on this age distribution. The (U-Th)/He age pattern is inconsistent with rock cooling underneath the present-day Hochalm-Ankogel Dome topography. The age minimum is interpreted to coincide with a paleotopographic maximum in the Hochalm-Ankogel Dome and suggests that the 40–60�C isotherms were warped sufficiently to affect apatite (U-Th)/He ages. The tunnel apatite (U-Th)/He ages match synthetic He ages derived from a two-dimensional numerical model of landscape evolution. Integrating the thermal model results with the data allows the relief development to be constrained and we calculate that the present-day Hochalm-Ankogel Dome topography was formed at 7 to 10 Ma.},

abstract = {Annealing rates for fission tracks in apatite vary markedly as a complex function of composition, based on an experimental study of 15 well-characterized, compositionally diverse apatites. Extensive annealing data were obtained in 69 experiments (durations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 h at temperatures from 75 to 400 °C) on each of four apatites, three with near end-member occupancy of the halogen site by F, Cl, and OH, plus the well-known apatite from Durango, Mexico. These results were supplemented by less-comprehensive annealing data from 12 experiments over the same range of time and temperature on each of the remaining 11 apatites. Measurements of initial fission-track length, a parameter of considerable importance to the derivation of time-temperature paths from fission-track data, reveal substantial variations from one apatite to another; initial lengths are best predicted from etch figures. Interlaboratory comparisons of data on annealing kinetics highlight discrepancies that appear to result largely from differences in the precision and accuracy of experimental temperatures. None of the factors previously proposed as the dominant compositional controls on annealing rates can account completely for annealing behavior over the full range of compositions studied. Nevertheless, relative rates of annealing among all apatites are highly systematic, which allows this data set to be used in its entirety to constrain multikinetic annealing models that predict fission-track lengths as a function of time and temperature.},

Problems of registration geometry, inhomogeneous uranium distribution, accumulated radiation damage and anisotropic etching largely invalidate all but the population and external detector methods, and impose strict limitations upon even their routine application. Complexities of unique, absolute thermal neutron dosimetry are illustrated by the calibration and use of the NBS pre-irradiated glass SRM 962. The 20% disparity in measured [lambda]f decay constant values cannot be isolated from neutron fluence ([phi]) measurement and calibration. Frequently a calibration ratio ([phi]/[lambda]f) is evaluated against an age standard and then split into its component parts. To illustrate this interdependence of [lambda]f and [phi], zircon fission track ages, in agreement with independent KAr ages, are obtained by calculating the same track count data with each of the preferred values of [lambda]f ([lambda]f = 7.03 � 10-17yr-1and8.46 � 10-17yr-1) together with appropriate, selected neutron dosimetry schemes. An alternative approach is presented, formally relating unknown ages of samples to known ages of standards, either by direct comparison of standard and sample track densities, or by the repeated calibration of a glass against age standards. Practical recommendations are given for the reporting and critical assessment of fission track data.},

A consequence is that if any observed correlation between counts of spontaneous and induced tracks is due to heterogeneity in the density of uranium, then the model proposed by McGee and Johnson (1979)for assessing the experimental error is inappropriate and results based on it could be misleading.

annote = { A methodology is presented for the prediction of fission-track parameters in geological situations from a laboratory-based description of annealing kinetics. To test the validity of extrapolation from laboratory to geological timescales, the approach is applied to a number of geological situations for which apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA) data are available and where thermal history is known with some confidence. Predicted fission-track parameters agree well with observation in all cases, giving confidence in the validity of the extrapolation, and suggesting that fission-track annealing takes place by a single pathway in both laboratory and geological conditions. The precision of predicted track lengths is considered in some detail. Typical levels of precision are \textasciitilde �0.5 [mu]m for mean lengths [precedes, approximate] 10 [mu]m, and \textasciitilde �0.3 [mu]m for length [greater, approximate] 10 [mu]m. Precision is largely independent of thermal history for any reasonable geological thermal history. Accuracy of prediction is limited principally by the effect of apatite composition on annealing kinetics. The development of fission-track parameters is illustrated through a series of notional thermal histories to emphasise various key aspects of the response of the system. Temperature dominates over time in determining final fission-track parameters, with an order of magnitude increase in time being equivalent to a \textasciitilde 10�C increase in temperature. The final length of a track is determined predominantly by the maximum temperature to which it is subjected. Aspects of AFTA response are further highlighted by prediction of patterns of AFTA parameters as a function of depth and temperature from a series of notional burial histories embodying a variety of thermal history styles. The quantitative understanding of AFTA response not only affords the basis of rigorous paleotemperature estimation, but also allows a better understanding of the situations in which AFTA can be applied to yield useful information.},

annote = { The relationship between reduced track density, [varrho]/[varrho]0, and reduced mean confined track length, L/L0, during annealing has been studied for both spontaneous and induced tracks in four apatite samples with different chemical composition, compositional range, and origin, and with spontaneous tracks giving mean confined track lengths varying from \textasciitilde 14.5 [mu]m down to 12.3 [mu]m. In all four apatites, induced tracks show a relationship between L/L0 and [varrho]/[varrho]0 composed of two regions; at higher values the two appear to be equal, while at lower values L/L0 is greater than [varrho]/[varrho]0. This can be understood qualitatively in terms of the anisotropy of annealing and the bias against revelation of short tracks. Data from three apatites of uniform composition show near-identical relationships. In a sample showing a range of apatite compositions, the point of divergence from the 1:1 relationship is somewhat higher than in the uniform composition apatites, because individual grains anneal at different rates, and the presence of highly annealed grains affects the track density more strongly than the mean track length. Spontaneous tracks show similar relationships to those observed for induced tracks in each sample, when the data are renormalised to allow for the natural annealing present in the spontaneous tracks. Previous studies which led to the idea of length reduction without density reduction for spontaneous tracks did not renormalise density data as well as length data, thereby distorting the apparent relationship. Data for the multi-compositional apatite sample where annealing has taken place in geological conditions also agrees with the laboratory annealing data for both spontaneous and induced tracks. This consistency suggests that a single process is responsible in all three cases, implying that a laboratory-based description of annealing can be applied to geological conditions with confidence. Recognition that spontaneous tracks in apatite are commonly annealed suggests that, in general, the fission track age should be interpreted as a reflection of both the time over which tracks have been retained and the distribution of etchable track lengths. Since the latter is a manifestation of the thermal history, the fission track age should be interpreted in similar terms.},

@article{Gunnell2000,
abstract = {The specific time window of apatite fission track thermochronology (AFTT) places it in a unique position to offer continuous time–temperature baseline histories for relatively stable shield, rift and passive margin environments, spanning several geological eras. Fission tracks anneal partially at temperatures between ap110 °C and ap60 °C and thereby provide information on residence times within specific levels of the crust. Most samples collected from these terrains, however, are usually found to have cooled out of the apatite partial annealing zone (APAZ) by the mid-Cenozoic at the latest. Owing to the stability, at geological timescales, of tracks at temperatures \textless60 °C (i.e. within depths of 0–2.5 km at normal geothermal gradients), a significant loss of resolution must therefore be reckoned with at shallow, although geomorphologically crucial, crustal depths. Indeed, the Neogene and Quaternary are understood to have been most influential in generating the scenery of today, and a use of radiometric and stratigraphic techniques in a nested, multisystem approach can assist in bridging the resolution gap. This paper examines and illustrates, mostly with original examples, the uses and limitations of AFTT in addressing the response of Earth surface systems to event patterns in global tectonics, the controls of lithology and structure on denudation rates, the origin and evolution of passive margin escarpments, the mass-balanced reconstruction of palaeoelief, the use of apatites as tracers for understanding provenance in sediment routing systems, and the tempo (or episodicity) of denudation as postulated by W. M. Davis' canons of the ‘geographical cycle'. Alongside efforts towards standardizing the supply of analytically robust AFT results in the laboratory, a more standardized geoscientific interpretation of AFT data is also desirable in order to build a consistent world base of geomorphic rates which can be made available to – and used with confidence by – non-AFTT specialists.},

@article{Chadderton2003,
abstract = {Observations of GeV heavy ion and MeV cluster-ion tracks in crystalline solids give us new insight into registration physics. Thermal and ion explosion spikes no longer compete; a ‘compound spike' accounts for both. Ion explosion dominates for surface tracks (electronic sputtering). And there can also be transient plasma stopping in the bulk. For clusters there are ‘vicinage effects'—both electronic and nuclear—which can influence track dimensions and structure. Displacement cascades in large energetic clusters may lead to projectile “fission” and coherent flow into sub-tracks. The absence of tracks in certain targets, and their size/structure in others, leads to a model of projectile assisted prompt anneal (PAPA) in ∼10−11s, either partial or complete, often by swift epitaxy, on elemental lattices (e.g. silicon) or on compound sublattices (e.g. fluorite). Phase transformations are important, but simple target amorphization is rare—the exception, not the rule. For many targets the thermal spike (macroscopic) fails, since ‘point' defects (atomistic) characteristic of the target, their motion, and the electronic band structure, determine latent track detail. Circumstances in which the Bragg Rule of Additivity fails completely are revealed, and the kinetic threshold for constructive phase transitions in tracks described. This same track physics applies generally also to geothermometry—the opposite time extremum (∼10+11s)—where annealing is due to defect assisted delayed anneal (DADA). Differences between etching rates of induced and spontaneous fission tracks can be explained. The geothermobarometric “Wendt/Vidal effect” (2002)—combined pressure, temperature and stress (with time) influences on fission track annealing (in e.g. apatite)—is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Poissonian errors, as routinely applied in fission-track dating, represent a limiting case, which may not always be attainable in practice. Other experimental factors may introduce additional non-Poissonian errors, which must be taken into account. In the population method, sampling of non-homogeneous uranium distributions introduces experimental error. In the external detector method (EDM), many factors exist to introduce such error. Simply quoting total numbers of spontaneous and induced fission tracks obtained by the EDM may disguise the possible influence of experimental variation. The present work concentrates on the EDM, and describes a test which has recently been proposed to detect the presence of experimental error in EDM analyses. The question of an alternative analysis for cases where such error is present is also considered. A method of presenting EDM data is suggeted, which allows assessment of the importance of experimental errors.},

Electron microprobe analyses of these apatites indicate that the annealing properties of individual grains are strongly controlled by their Cl/F ratio.

New High precision measurements of confined track lengths in annealed Durango apatite, however, seem to be described by a single activation energy or only a very narrow range of energies (about 30%), implying a near parallelism of lines for various degrees of length reduction in an Arrhenius plot. Borehole studies have shown that different apatite grains respond to the same annealing conditions to differing degrees. Electron microprobe analyses of these apatites indicate that the annealing properties of individual grains are strongly controlled by their Cl/F ratio. The interpretation of laboratory annealing studies, and to a lesser extent borehole studies, in terms of fanning Arrhenius plots may be understood as the result of the superposition of a series of near parallel Arrhenius plots corresponding to the range of compositions present, each characterised by different activation energies.},

@article{Ketcham2000,
abstract = {AFTSolve is a computer program for deriving thermal history information from apatite fission-track data. It implements a new fission-track annealing model that takes into account the known kinetic variability among different apatite species. To fully utilize this model, a fission-track worker must obtain data that can be used to infer the kinetic characteristics of each apatite grain from which a measurement was taken. Such data can consist of etch figure lengths or chemical composition. The benefit of this overall approach is that it allows useful information to be derived from previously unusable analyses, extends the practical range of geological temperatures constrained by fission-track analyses, and increases overall confidence in model predictions. AFTSolve also incorporates the effects of fission-track orientation relative to the apatite crystallographic c-axis, variation in initial track length, and the biasing effect of 252Cf irradiation for enhancing confined horizontal track length detection. AFTSolve is written for Windows operating systems, and has a graphical interface that allows interactive input of thermal histories and real-time generation of estimates for fission-track length distributions and ages for up to six simultaneously modeled kinetic populations. It also includes procedures for estimating the range of time-temperature histories that are statistically consistent with a data set and constraints entered by the user.},

@article{garver1999exhumation,
abstract = {A relatively new field in provenance analysis is detrital fission-track thermochronology which utilizes grain ages from sediment shed off an orogen to elucidate its exhumational history. Four examples highlight the approach and usefulness of the technique. (1) Fission-track grain age (FTGA) distribution of apatite from modern sediment of the Bergell region of the Italian Alps corresponds to ages obtained from bedrock studies. Two distinct peak-age populations at 14.8 Ma and 19.8 Ma give calculated erosion rates identical to in situ bedrock. (2) Zircon FTGA distribution from the modern Indus River in Pakistan is used to estimate the mean erosion rate for the Indus River drainage basin to be about 560 m Ma−1, but locally it is in excess of 1000 m Ma−1. (3) FTGA distribution of detrital apatite and zircon from the Tofino basin records exhumation of the Coast Mountains in the Canadian Cordillera. Comparison of detrital zircon and apatite FT ages gives exhumation rates of c. 200 m Ma−1 during the interval between c. 34 and 54 Ma, but higher rates (c. 1500 m Ma−1) at c. 56 Ma. (4) FTGA analysis of apatite grain ages from a young basin flanking Fiordland in New Zealand indicates that removal of cover strata was followed by profound exhumation at c. 30 Ma, which corresponds to plate reorganization at this time. Exhumation rates at the onset of exhumation were c. 2000–5000 m Ma−1. These studies outline the technique of detrital FTGA applied to exhumation studies and highlight practical considerations: (1) well-dated, stratigraphically coordinated suites of samples that span the exhumation event provide the best long-term record; (2) strata from the basin perimeter are the most likely to retain unreset detrital ages; (3) the removal of ‘cover rocks' precedes exhumation of deeply buried rocks, which retain a thermal signal of the exhumation event; (4) steady-state exhumation produces peak ages that progressively young with time and have a constant lag time; (5) same-sample comparison of zircon and apatite peak ages is best in sequences with high-uranium apatite grains (>50 ppm), and peak-ages statistics can be improved by counting numerous apatite grains (>100).},

The contribution of sediment loading to the subsidence has been evaluated and removed. Corrections for effects of compaction, water depth and changes of sea-level were also included. The remaining subsidence has been interpreted in terms of a simple thermal model for the cooling lithosphere. Based on this model a thickness of the thermal lithosphere of 113-139 km is estimated. The total subsidence and crustal thinning beneath the COST B-2 well are also estimated and used to place constraints on models for the origin of the margin.},

abstract = {Forward reconstructions of the (mainly) Mesozoic and younger rheological evolution have been made for four basins (Broad Fourteens Basin, Sole Pit Basin, Brittany Basin and the Iberian Basin) in a very consistent way by backstripping and automatic forward modeling of subsidence data, including potentially important effects of heat production, sediment infill and sedimentary blanketing. For default compositional and thermal parameters, the modeling results show strengthening in all basins, and in particular during inversion, with strength increases up to about 2 TN m−1 (20%) relative to their initial values. Given predominantly relatively constant intraplate stresses in continental lithosphere, this is in disagreement with repeated localization of basin deformation. In a thorough sensitivity analysis we explore the possibilities that permissible variations in tectonic history, compositional, rheological and thermal parameters can, in a particular combination, result in slight weakening of the basin, in agreement with reactivation during inversion. However, such a combination reflects an extreme scenario, which is not founded by geological evidence and, statistically, is very unlikely to apply for all basins. A far more likely explanation for relative and permanent weakening of the basins is the presence of pre-existing weak zones, deviating from standard rheological assumptions. At (upper) crustal levels, weakening can be attributed to pre-existing marked faults by a reduced friction angle. This weakening has a pronounced influence on lithospheric strength provided that the reduction in friction angle of pre-existing faults can be extrapolated to the upper mantle. Alternatively, weakening of the upper mantle can be attributed to (1) ductile localization mechanisms, as reflected by the occurrence of upper mantle shear zones, or (2) the occurrence of rheologically weak material, as indicated by upper mantle reflectors.},

@article{Lowell1995,
abstract = {Inversion is dependent on pre-existing basin configuration in the initial subsidence, usually extensional phase, and the resolution of compressional forces in the later shortening phase. External horizontal, rather than isostatic vertical forces are required for inversion because many deep sediment-filled basins around the world have never been inverted, but should have been, if isostatic rebound were the driving mechanism. Inversion can range in scale from basins to sub-basins to selected structures within basins. Typically, rift basins can be later inverted. Mainly by reactivation of older normal faults, inversion selects rift basins where, in pure shear, weakening because of necking or thinning of lithosphere has occurred; and where, in simple shear, mechanical detachment surfaces are available for subsequent movement. Some pre-existing lows or sags can apparently be inverted in the absence of reactivated normal faults, as in the southern Altiplano of Bolivia and offshore Sabah, Borneo. Basins can be inverted by dominantly strike-slip with some convergent component, e.g. offshore northeast Brazil, and by almost direct compression, Atlas Mountains, Morocco. A prime difference is that convergent strike-slip can reactivate relatively high-angle normal faults as reverse faults, whereas these faults tend to lock when subjected to more direct compression which then creates lower angle contractional faults. Usually, inversion is caused by a combination of compression and strike-slip (transpression) because the azimuth of maximum principal compressional stress to the direction of original basin trend vectors into an oblique-slip component. This is illustrated in northern Argentina where compression derived from Andean deformation is resolved obliquely (about 45degrees) against an older rift basin in the foreland nearby. Interestingly, for this area at least, the 45degrees angle which affords an equal contribution of strike slip and compression results only in reactivation of older normal faults and does not create younger contractional features. Apparently compressive forces can be transmitted backward from the lead edge of an underthrusted foreland plate to invert rather remote regions and basins that are carried on that plate; this may be a significant part of the mechanism for basin inversion in northwest Europe and the southern North Sea as that foreland region underthrusted along the Alpine system.},

@article{VanBalen1998,
abstract = {In-plane horizontal stresses acting on predeformed lithosphere induce differential flexural vertical motions. A high-precision record of these motions can be found in the sedimentary record of rifted basins. Originally, it was proposed that rifted basins experience flank uplift and basin center subsidence in response to a compressive change of in-plane stress, which agrees well with observed differential motions. Subsequently published models predicted that the vertical motions may be opposite because of the flexural state of the lithosphere induced by necking during extension. However, the total, flexural and permanent, geometry of the lithosphere underlying the rifted basin is the controlling parameter for the in-plane stress-caused vertical motions. The largest part of this preexisting geometry is caused by faulting in the uppermost brittle part of the crust and ductile deformation in the underlying parts of the lithosphere. We present a new multilayered model for stress-induced differential subsidence, taking into account the technically induced preexisting geometry of the lithosphere, including faults in the upper crust. As continental lithosphere may exhibit flexural decoupling due to a weak lower crustal layer, the new multilayer in-plane stress model discriminates the geometries of the separate competent layers. At a basin-wide scale, the new model predicts that a compressive change of in-plane force results in basin center subsidence and flank uplift, confirming the original hypothesis. Compared to all previous models, the new model requires a lower horizontal stress level change to explain observed differential vertical motions.},

Only limited heating of the crust is caused by lithospheric thinning. In the simple but realistic situation where heat conduction is substantially faster than heat advection, no major thermal disturbance is associated with the downward movement of the hanging wall. Radiometric ages and fault rocks associated with the Lugano-Val Grande normal fault demonstrate that cooling rather than heating affected the crust during normal faulting. This pattern is not compatible with such a simple numerical model and is explained by a waning thermal anomaly induced by a magmatic intrusion immediately preceding or overlapping with the first stages of normal faulting. The magmatic body must have been emplaced at depths greater than 15-18 km, and probably started to cool in the Carnian i.e. few million years before the onset of normal faulting along the Lugano-Val Grande fault.},

@article{Paola2005,
abstract = {[`]Inversion structures' (e.g. folds, reverse faults) spatially associated with basin-bounding faults are very widely recognised in rift basins in both onshore and offshore settings worldwide. The great majority of such structures are attributed to local or regional crustal shortening events. There is, however, an alternative, which is investigated in this paper: inversion could reflect a horizontal shortening component of deformation formed during progressive and partitioned transtension. A case study from the Carboniferous Northumberland Basin shows that shortening structures can also form in obliquely divergent rifts if the bulk strain undergoes kinematic partitioning into distinct regions of wrench- and extension-dominated transtension. Such strain partitioning appears to be particularly favoured in basins where fault localisation is strongly influenced by pre-existing basement structures. This may occur because the pre-existing anisotropies are zones of long-lived weakness that lie in an orientation particularly favourable to the preferential accommodation of either strike-slip or dip-slip displacements. Our strain analysis applied to the Northumberland Basin, traditionally considered as a classic example of a Variscan inverted basin, reduces the deformation history to a single kinematically partitioned phase of dextral transtension during the late Carboniferous-early Permian. Our findings have profound implications for the interpretation of inversion structures in any rift basin where the direction of extension may be significantly oblique to the basin margins.},

Two extreme cases of basins were investigated to identify the scale of this mechanism: the Gulf of Lion illustrates a case of a young basin, in which the average sedimentation rate is high (620 m/Ma), and the Viking graben in the North Sea offers a case of a basin formed in the Triassic, but where average sedimentation rate is much less (37 m/Ma). In the former, the sediments absorb 30% of the surface heat flow, while in the latter the effect is only 10%.},

@article{Hansen2003,
annote = {The common observation of sedimentary basin inversion in orogenic forelands implies that rifts constitute weak areas of the continental lithosphere. When compressed, the rifts respond with uplift of the deepest parts and erosion of sediments therein. Simultaneously, syn-compressional marginal troughs are formed flanking the inversion zone.

Since rifting and subsequent post-rift thermal re-equilibration are processes expected to alter the long-term mechanical state of the lithosphere, the phenomenon of basin inversion is non-trivial from a rheological point of view. Stochastic modelling of the long-term thermal structure beneath sedimentary basins indicates that the crustal part of a rift is warmer, and hence weaker, than the surrounding crustal blocks. In contrast, the mantle part is cold and strong beneath the basin centre.
In this paper, it is investigated whether the rifting-induced strength alterations constitute a sufficient condition for a thermally equilibrated rift to invert by compression. Numerical experiments with two-dimensional dynamic thermo-mechanical models are performed. In particular, the focus is on rifting-related mechanical instabilities that reduce the load bearing capacity of the lithosphere. In the experiments, strain-softening behaviour is introduced in the non-associated plasticity model representing brittle yielding. The result is self-consistent large-scale fault formation.
The models predict that the rifting-related necking instability induces differential crustal thinning increasing the post-rift crustal weakness. Strain softening and the associated fault formation amplifies the necking instability and introduces zones of structural weakness exposed for compressional re-activation.
Under these circumstances, basin inversion follows as a natural consequence of rift compression.},

@article{DeJager2003,
abstract = {All Dutch rift basins that formed during Jurassic and Early Cretaceous extension have been inverted during the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. Several inversion pulses occurred more or less simultaneously in all basins. Analysis of vitrinite reflectance data, in combination with fission track and fluid inclusion data show that the magnitude of uplift and erosion generally did not exceed 2 km. Inversion was strongest in the Broad Fourteens, Central Netherlands and West Netherlands basins. The direction of maximum compressive stress was generally not at right angles to the pre-existing fault trends, and resulted in transpressional movements. Within the NW-SE striking basins, dextral strike-slip movements can often be interpreted, which is consistent with a general N-S to NNW-SSE direction of maximum compression related to Alpine structural events. Where no Zechstein salt is present, trends of flower structures formed through reverse reactivation of pre-existing faults. Where the Zechstein salt is thick, re-activated faults could not breach the salt, and a broad uplift of the post-salt succession resulted, while faulting below the salt caused acceleration of halokinesis. In area where the Zechstein salt was thin, and where the offsets of reverse faults exceeded the thickness of the salt, impressive thrusts with the Zechstein salt as detachment horizon developed. The later Tertiary inversion pulses did not affect all basins, and caused broad basin uplift in the West and Central Netherlands basins while individual faults were no longer reactivated. It appears that due to crustal thickening during the first inversion pulses the crust could become stabilised such that further compression could only be accommodated by broad basin uplift.},

abstract = {A finite difference model is presented, describing the thermal structure of a region undergoing fault-controlled extension. The model is two-dimensional and time-dependent. We combine temperature changes resulting from conduction, advection due to fault movements, sediment blanketing and heat production. Cooling curves can be derived at chosen points in the area. This study mainly investigates the effect of the extension rate on the thermal field, which turns out to be very important. 20 km of extension with extension rates of 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mm/yr yield maximum deviations in temperatures from the steady-slate situation of 2, 26 and 84%. The sediment blanketing effect can even be reversed by variations in the sedimentation rates. Fast sedimentation leads to crustal cooling, slow sedimentation to crustal heating. The turning-point value is lithology-dependent and corresponds to 2.0 mm/yr for shale, 2.2 mm/yr for clay, and 1.4 mm/yr for sand; a sandstone will cause an increased cooling at both high and low velocities. Our modelling shows that footwall cooling during or immediately after a rifting event cannot be explained by the downwards movement of the adjacent, relatively cold hanging wall. Consequently, in areas where such a cooling is observed, other cooling mechanisms must play an important role. These can be phenomena like footwall uplift or the fading out of an older thermal anomaly.},

abstract = {A simple model for the development and evolution of sedimentary basins is proposed. The first event consists of a rapid stretching of continental lithosphere, which produces thinning and passive upwelling of hot asthenosphere. This stage is associated with block faulting and subsidence. The lithosphere then thickens by heat conduction to the surface, and further slow subsidence occurs which is not associated with faulting. The slow subsidence and the heat flow depend only on the amount of stretching, which can be estimated from these quantities and from the change in thickness of the continental crust caused by the extension. The model is therefore easily tested. Preliminary investigations of the Great Basin, the Aegean, the North Sea and the Michigan Basin suggest that the model can account for the major events in their evolution.},

abstract = {We apply a recently developed 3D flexure model incorporating lateral variations in flexural rigidity (EET) and necking depth (zn) to study the 3D effects of intraplate stresses on Quaternary accelerated subsidence and uplift in the North Sea Basin and adjacent areas. In the model approach lateral variations and magnitude of predicted Quaternary vertical motions are largely dependent on the pre-existing Late Tertiary flexural state of the area and the relative change in magnitude and orientation of intraplate stresses in the Quaternary. The Late Tertiary deflections are reconstructed by incorporating lithospheric stretching values calculated from the Mesozoic subsidence record, and by adopting admissible variations in necking depth (zn) and flexural rigidity (EET) from earlier work. The 3D model results for the North Sea and adjacent areas indicate that an increase of compressive intraplate forces with a magnitude of about 2.25 x 1012 N/m can predict accelerated subsidence values up to 700 m, largely in agreement with observed patterns of Quaternary isopach values corrected for effects of shallowing waterdepth. The magnitude of the intraplate forces is 2 to 3 times lower than predicted by earlier 2D studies. It is believed that the 2D model results actually overestimate required stress levels, since they do not take into account the effect of out-of-plane stresses. The relative increase in compressive forces is in agreement with observed compressive stresses and the magnitude corresponds to characteristic values for plate boundary forces. The adopted values for zn and EET do not show a clear relation with the preceding basin history.},

abstract = {We performed a detailed analysis of the thermal state of the Cenozoic Roer Valley Graben, the north2013western branch of the European Cenozoic Rift System, based on a new set of temperature data. We developed a numerical technique for correcting bottom hole temperatures, including an evaluation of the uncertainty of thermal parameters. Comparison with drill stem test temperatures indicated that the uncertainty in corrected bottom hole temperatures using a two-component numerical model is approximately � 4��C, which is much more accurate than the up to 15��C errors encountered in often-used line-source or Horner correction methods. The subsurface temperatures and the derived regional heat flow estimates of 53 � 6 to 63 � 6�mW�m22122 show no significant difference between the central rift and the adjacent structural highs. The absence of an elevated heat flow is attributed to the low amount of lithospheric thinning during the Cenozoic rifting phase (03B2=1.0620131.15). A local thermal anomaly exceeding +10��C was found in five wells in the north2013western part of the rift basin at depths of 100020131500�m, and is most likely caused by the upward flow of fluids along faults, whereas lower temperatures in the upper 1500�m in the southern part of the rift basin could indicate cooling by topography-driven groundwater flow. Conflicting ideas exist on the active or passive rifting mechanisms responsible for the formation of the different rift basins of European Cenozoic Rift System. The low spatial variation in heat flow found in this study suggests that the mechanism responsible for forming the Roer Valley Graben is passive rifting.},

@article{Sclater1980,
abstract = {The North Sea is a major continental basin filled with early Paleozoic to Recent sediments. Though graben formation started in the Triassic, the last major period of extension occurred between the Middle Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous. Following the faulting and graben formation associated with this extension, subsidence within the central North Sea was widespread and uniform and has created a saucer-shaped sedimentary basin. This was filled successively by chalks, sandstones, and finally, during most of the Tertiary, by shales and mud-stones. We examined the subsidence of six wells down the middle and two on the flanks of the Central Graben. In the period of widespread steady subsidence the water-loaded basement depth in the middle increased by 1100-1400 m. On the flanks the basement subsided 600-700 m. We suggest that most of this subsidence results from the thermal relaxation of the lithosphere which was thinned during a Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous stretching of the crust. Assuming a crustal stretching and associated lithospheric thinning of between 50 and 100% in the middle and decreasing on either side, we obtained a good match to the observed amplitude and rate of subsidence. The Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous subsidence which is found within the graben proper we relate to the fault-controlled initial subsidence which occurred during the actual stretching. The measurd heat flow is compatible with such a stretching model. Though there is no seismic refraction data across the Central Graben, this model is strongly supported by evidence of a thinner crust under the Viking Graben to the north and the Witchground/Buchan Graben complex to the east. Using the above observations as the basis for a geological interpretation, we examined the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon potential of certain sedimentary horizons in the northern section of the Central Graben. In analyzing the various wells we extended previous work on the compaction correction to handle overpressuring and mixed lithologies in backstripping studies. Further, we expanded these methods to include the variation of thermal conductivity, and calculations of the degree of thermal maturation of the deposited sediments, through time.},

abstract = {The fact that basin inversion is possible long after the cessation of rifting indicates that at least some sedimentary basins are characterized by permanent relative weakness. This paper investigates whether the steady-state thermal structure in itself can provide the necessary pattern of rheological weakening to facilitate compressional inversion of a sedimentary basin. By Monte Carlo simulation of a two-dimensional thermal finite element model we find that, generally, the maximum Moho temperature, and therefore also the weakest upper mantle, is encountered beneath the flanks of the basin. The reason for this is heat refraction deviating away from the central parts of the sedimentary cover and into the adjacent basement highs. The weakest crust, however, is located in the center of the basin due to sediment thermal blanketing, lower confining pressure, and the presence of relatively weak sediments.},

@article{Brodie1995,
abstract = {There is now general agreement that many sedimentary basins on the northwest continental shelf of Europe underwent permanent exhumation during the Tertiary. The most dramatic indicator of this process is the present-day absence of up to 3 km of anticipated post-rift subsidence in the midlands of Britain and in the East Irish Sea. Any explanation must take into account the fact that the entire shelf has very small, long wavelength, free-air gravity anomalies. This constraint is of fundamental importance and implies either that the crust has been thickened, that phase changes have occurred within the lithosphere, or that low density material has been added to the lithosphere. Tertiary epeirogenic uplift and exhumation is often attributed to horizontal shortening which is assumed to be related in a general sense to Alpine mountain building. However, the removal of 3 km of sediment from a basin, which was originally 100 km wide, requires 20-30 km of shortening. Whilst minor Tertiary shortening is observed all over the continental shelf, nowhere is it sufficient to account for the inferred amount of denudation. More significantly, exhumation is thought to have commenced in the Early Tertiary and dramatically increases from south to north. Shortening is generally younger (mid-Tertiary) and decreases in intensity from south to north. Here we argue that Tertiary uplift and denudation are a consequence of regional igneous underplating. At the beginning of the Tertiary, rifting associated with the initiation of the Iceland plume generated substantial volumes of melt. Petrological arguments and the results from inversion of rare earth element concentrations of MgO-rich igneous rocks suggest that a minimum of 2-5 km of melt were produced beneath a substantial part of the continental shelf. We infer that much of this melt was trapped within the lithosphere, presumably close to the Moho, which would have acted as a density filter. Such underplating will have caused rapid surface uplift whilst maintaining isostatic equilibrium. Simple calculations based on deep seismic reflection data and the high P-wave velocities observed beneath Scotland are consistent with the petrological arguments.},

abstract = {Sedimentary basin inversion, the shortening of formerly extensional basins, is accommodated mainly by compressional reactivation of extant faults and fractures across a wide range of scales. As such, inversion is a large-scale manifestation of Byerlee friction, the dynamic criterion for fault reactivation governing the effective shear strength of the shallow crust. Basin inversion generates distinctive deformational architecture, and it is implicated strongly in sedimentary basin exhumation. As a principal source of horizontal stress, inversion drives significant sedimentary porosity reduction and resultant fluid flow. Upper crustal deformation is critically dependent on fluid overpressure (i.e., pore fluid pressures greater than would be calculated from a hydrostatic gradient), and, perhaps more than in any other tectonic setting, overpressures are potentially large during sedimentary basin inversion. This review therefore includes discussion of the role of fluid overpressure in inversion and the evidence for it. Collectively, inversion has profound implications–good and bad–for the prospectivity of many petroliferous sedimentary basins. Thus, recognizing the evidence for basin inversion, quantifying its magnitude and understanding the mechanisms that accommodate inversion and other phenomena affected by it, have become essential components of the basin analyst's remit.},

abstract = {Orographic precipitation of Pacific-sourced moisture creates a rain shadow across the central part of the Sierra Nevada (California) that contrasts with the southern part of the range, where seasonal monsoonal precipitation sourced to the south obscures this rain shadow effect. Orographic rainout systematically lowers the hydrogen isotope composition of precipitation (deltaD(ppt)) and therefore deltaD(ppt) reflects a measure of the magnitude of the rain shadow. Hydrogen isotope compositions of volcanic glass (deltaD(glass)) hydrated at the earth's surface provide a unique opportunity to track the elevation and precipitation history of the Sierra Nevada and adjacent Basin and Range Province. Analysis of 67 well dated volcanic glass samples from widespread volcanic ash-fall deposits located from the Pacific coast to the Basin and Range Province demonstrates that between 0.6 and 12.1 Ma the hydrogen isotope compositions of meteoric water displayed a large (>40 per thousand) decrease from the windward to the leeward side of the central Sierra Nevada, consistent with the existence of a rain shadow of modern magnitude over that time. Evidence for a Miocene-to-recent rain shadow of constant magnitude and systematic changes in the longitudinal climate and precipitation patterns strongly suggest that the modern first-order topographic elements of the Sierra Nevada characterized the landscape over at least the last 12 million years.},

abstract = {A chemical kinetic model is presented that uses Arrhenius rate constants to calculate vitrinite elemental composition as a function of time and temperature. The model uses distributions of activation energies for each of four reactions: elimination of water, carbon dioxide, methane and higher hydrocarbons. The resulting composition is used to calculate vitrinite reflectance via correlations between elemental composition and reflectance. The correlations are derived from published measurements. The model is valid for %Ro values from slightly less than 0.3 to slightly greater than 4. Model calculations are compared to published vitrinite data from both laboratory experiments and sedimentary columns where adequate thermal histories are available. Calculated and measured %Ro values generally agree within 0.1 at low rank and 0.4 at high rank, which is comparable to uncertainties in the experimental values. This confirms our starting premise that vitrinite reflectance is properly described by standard chemical kinetics with activation energies that extrapolate from laboratory to geological maturation temperatures. The model indicates that the relationship between the extent of oil generation and vitrinite reflectance is nearly independent of heating rate.},

@article{Kombrink2008,
abstract = {ABSTRACT The large thickness of Upper Carboniferous strata found in the Netherlands suggests that the area was subject to long-term subsidence. However, the mechanisms responsible for subsidence are not quantified and are poorly known. In the area north of the London Brabant Massif, onshore United Kingdom, subsidence during the Namurian-Westphalian B has been explained by Dinantian rifting, followed by thermal subsidence. In contrast, south and east of the Netherlands, along the southern margin of the Northwest European Carboniferous Basin, flexural subsidence caused the development of a foreland basin. It has been proposed that foreland flexure due to Variscan orogenic loading was also responsible for Late Carboniferous subsidence in the Netherlands. In the first part of this paper, we present a series of modelling results in which the geometry and location of the Variscan foreland basin was calculated on the basis of kinematic reconstructions of the Variscan thrust system. Although several uncertainties exist, it is concluded that most subsidence calculated from well data in the Netherlands cannot be explained by flexural subsidence alone. Therefore, we investigated whether a Dinantian rifting event could adequately explain the observed subsidence by inverse modelling. The results show that if only a Dinantian rifting event is assumed, such as is found in the United Kingdom, a very high palaeowater depth at the end of the Dinantian is required to accommodate the Namurian-Westphalian B sedimentary sequence. To better explain the observed subsidence curves, we propose (1) an additional stretching event during the Namurian and (2) a model incorporating an extra dynamic component, which might well explain the very high wavelength of the observed subsidence compared with the wavelength of the predicted flexural foreland basin.},

abstract = {This paper discusses isotopic and geochemical trends in shallow burial (\textless1500 m) carbonate cements in limestones from a Middle Jurassic shale-dominated marine to paralic succession situated on the East Midlands Shelf. The results are used to investigate carbonate-shale interactions between the near-surface realm of microbially mediated diagenesis and the deep thermobaric regime of clay mineral transformations and hydrocarbon generation. They are also combined with published data from cements in stratigraphically and geographically adjacent strata to better understand the Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic palaeohydrology of central-eastern England (East Midlands Shelf-Midland Platform).Shallow burial cements sampled from the Blisworth Limestone Formation consist of ferroan calcite and calcic ankerite, which are associated with ferroan neomorphic calcite and ”beef” (cone-in-cone) calcite veins. Calcite cements are petrographically complex and variable, yet record consistent compositional trends. Carbon isotope values (delta13C=-1.2%% to +1.7%% PDB) show that organic matter breakdown did not contribute significant carbon to the shallow burial pore fluids. Oxygen isotope data (delta18O=-4.5%% to -11.2%% PDB) are consistent with precipitation from modified marine pore fluids that displaced the original brackish depositional fluids from the limestone during Palaeocene burial. The same fluids accompanied cementation in underlying Bajocian limestones. Ferroan calcite cements, neomorphic spar and ”beef” record a surprising correlation in Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentration that suggests a common source for the ions in the adjacent shales. This trend is not present in the Bajocian limestones and indicates that ionic mass transfer was on a smaller scale than the regional ”plumbing system”.The results suggest that Middle Jurassic limestone palaeoaquifers on the East Midlands Shelf hosted a westerly-directed, up-dip flow from compacting Upper and Lower Jurassic marine mudrocks in the Sole Pit Basin during the Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. However, Early Cretaceous meteoric groundwater palaeoaquifers recorded from cements in laterally equivalent Middle Jurassic limestones on the Midlands Platform and in the Weald Basin appear not to have extended northward into the East Midlands Shelf.},

abstract = {Natural fault damage zones (FDZs) are characterized by complex geometries and topologies, and by strongly-contrasting material properties. Accurate simulation of fluid flow in such systems is dependent on the method of discretization and the mathematical representation of the flow. In this paper, we focus on the conceptual and methodological issues that link a model of a heterogeneous system and its flow response. We study FDZs as our example, where each thin fault strand is a barrier to flow. We examine two contrasting discretization schemes and apply them to 2D FDZ models that contain a realistic array of linear fault traces. Both schemes produce results that are generally in good agreement, and agree with the results calculated by a more accurate (but computationally less efficient) reference scheme. However, differences occur when the discretization approach fails to maintain the fault connectivity (topology) of the input model. It is important to guide the modelling by identifying any continuous flow pathways in the matrix linking fluid inlets and outlets (Through-Going Regions, TGRs). We illustrate a new scheme that identifies all TGRs and determines a grid that is just fine enough to resolve them.},

abstract = {Abstract Thermal convection has the potential to be a significant and widespread mechanism of fluid flow, mass transport, and heat transport in rift and other extensional basins. Based on numerical simulation results, large-scale convection can occur on the scale of the basin thickness, depending on the Rayleigh number for the basin. Our analysis indicates that for syn-rift and early post-rift settings with a basin thickness of 5 km, thermal convection can occur for basal heat flows ranging from 80 to 150 mW m-2, when the vertical hydraulic conductivity is on the order of 1.5 m year-1 and lower. The convection cells have characteristic wavelengths and flow patterns depending on the thermal and hydraulic boundary conditions. Steeply dipping extensional faults can provide pathways for vertical fluid flow across large thicknesses of basin sediments and can modify the dynamics of thermal convection. The presence of faults perturbs the thermal convective flow pattern and can constrain the size and locations of convection cells. Depending on the spacing of the faults and the hydraulic properties of the faults and basin sediments, the convection cells can be spatially organized to align with adjacent faults. A fault-bounded cell occurs when one convection cell is constrained to occupy a fault block so that the up-flow zone converges into one fault zone and the down-flow zone is centred on the adjacent fault. A fault-bounded cell pair occurs when two convection cells occupy a fault block with the up-flow zone located between the faults and the down-flow zones centred on the adjacent faults or with the reverse pattern of flow. Fault-bounded cells and cell pairs can be referred to collectively as fault-bounded convective flow. The flow paths in fault-bounded convective flow can be lengthened significantly with respect to those of convection cells unperturbed by the presence of faults. The cell pattern and sense of circulation depend on the fault spacing, sediment and fault permeabilities, lithologic heterogeneity, and the basal heat flow. The presence of fault zones also extends the range of conditions for which thermal convection can occur to basin settings with Rayleigh numbers below the critical value for large-scale convection to occur in a basin without faults. The widespread potential for the occurrence of thermal convection suggests that it may play a role in controlling geological processes in rift basins including the acquisition and deposition of metals by basin fluids, the distribution of diagenetic processes, the temperature field and heat flow, petroleum generation and migration, and the geochemical evolution of basin fluids. Fault-bounded cells and cell pairs can focus mass and heat transport from longer flow paths into fault zones, and their discharge zones are a particularly favourable setting for the formation of sediment-hosted ore deposits near the sea floor.},

abstract = {The permeability of a sand shale mixture is analyzed as a function of shale fraction and the permeability of the two end-members, i.e., the permeability of a clay-free sand and the permeability of a pure shale. First, we develop a model for the permeability of a clay-free sand as a function of the grain diameter, the porosity, and the electrical cementation exponent. We show that the Kozeny-Carman-type relation can be improved by using electrical parameters which separate pore throat from total porosity and effective from total hydraulic radius. The permeability of a pure shale is derived in a similar way but is strongly dependent on clay mineralogy. For the same porosity, there are 5 orders of magnitude of difference between the permeability of pure kaolinite and the permeability of pure smectite. The separate end-members' permeability models are combined by filling the sand pores progressively with shale and then dispersing the sand grains in shale. The permeability of sand shale mixtures is shown to have a minimum at the critical shale content at which shale just fills the sand pores. Pure shale has a slightly higher permeability. Permeability decreases sharply with shale content as the pores of a sand are filled. The permeability of sand shale mixtures thus has a very strong dependence on shale fraction, and available data confirm this distinctive shale-fraction dependence. In addition, there is agreement (within 1 order of magnitude) between the permeabilities predicted from our model and those measured over 11 orders of magnitude from literature sources. Finally, we apply our model to predict the permeabilities of shaly sand formations in the Gulf Coast. The predictions are compared to a data set of permeability determination made on side-wall cores. The agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data is very good.},

@article{Evans1997,
abstract = {The permeability structure of a fault zone in granitic rocks has been investigated by laboratory testing of intact core samples from the unfaulted protolith and the two principal fault zone components; the fault core and the damaged zone. The results of two test series performed on rocks obtained from outcrop are reported. First, tests performed at low confining pressure on 2.54-cm-diameter cores indicate how permeability might vary within different components of a fault zone. Second, tests conducted on 5.1-cm-diameter cores at a range of confining pressures (from 2 to 50 MPa) indicate how variations in overburden or pore fluid pressures might influence the permeability structure of faults. Tests performed at low confining pressure indicate that the highest permeabilities are found in the damaged zone (10-16-10-14 m2), lowest permeabilities are in the fault core (\textless 10-20-10-17 m2), with intermediate permeabilities found in the protolith (10-17-10-16 m2). A similar relationship between permeability and fault zone structure is obtained at progressively greater confining pressure. Although the permeability of each sample decays with increasing confining pressure, the protolith sustains a much greater decline in permeability for a given change in confining pressure than the damaged zone or fault core. This result supports the inference that protolith samples have short, poorly connected fractures that close more easily than the greater number of more throughgoing fractures found in the damaged zone and fault core. The results of these experiments show that, at the coreplug scale, the damaged zone is a region of higher permeability between the fault core and protolith. These results are consistent with previous field-based and in-situ investigations of fluid flow in faults formed in crystalline rocks. We suggest that, where present, the two-part damaged zone-fault core structure can lead to a bulk anisotropy in fault zone permeability. Thus, fault zones with well-developed damaged zones can lead to enhanced fluid flow through a relatively thin tabular region parallel to the fault plane, whereas the fault core restricts fluid flow across the fault. Although this study examined rocks collected from outcrop, correlation with insitu flow tests indicates that our results provide inexact, but useful, insights into the hydromechanical character of faults found in the shallow crust.},

The main results and conclusions are as follows: (1) Equilibrium temperature is 118.6 °C at 4000 m in the KTB pilot borehole (KTB-VB) and will be around 260 °C at 9100 m in the KTB main borehole (KTB-HB). Time required for thermal equilibration of the KTB-HB to within 1% of the initial perturbation will be about 13–16 years. (2) The failure to predict temperature correctly for the KTB was mainly due to an unaccounted perturbation by a transient ground surface temperature history. (3) Pleistocene surface temperature variations affect the present-day crustal temperature between 1.3 to 2.7 K up to a depth of 4000 m. Accordingly, present-day heat flow density is systematically too low down to approximately 1500 m. Model simulations indicate that groundwater flow does not eliminate paleoclimatic signals, even though it may translate them to a depth incompatible with both their diffusive age and their amplitude. These results emphasize the importance of an adequate consideration of paleoclimatic effects for the interpretation of thermal data. (4) Lateral heat transport is significant when steep inclination and folding of the rock formations coincide with contrasts in thermal conductivity. This is indicated by typical variations in the vertical components of temperature gradient and heat flow density, such as in the KTB-HB. In contrast, thermally relevant advection of heat is confined to the top 500–1000 m. In the vicinity of the KTB, this is about twice the maximum difference in elevation. (5) In the deeper crust, free convection systems require permeabilities greater than 10−17 m2 for large rock volumes, but simple numerical models indicate that the associated temperature regimes are incompatible with KTB borehole data. (6) Heat production rate shows no systematic variation with depth and is related to lithology at the KTB as in other deep boreholes in crystalline rock. Numerical models, using heat production rate derived from seismic velocities, yield temperatures compatible with KTB borehole data.},

abstract = {Inversion zones are elongate structures, some tens of kilometers wide and up to hundreds of kilometers long, that have deformed in response to compression and produced topography. Inversion zones in the Alpine foreland are mainly associated with Mesozoic grabens and troughs, and although very important in the geologic picture, the conditions of their formation and evolution and their regional geologic significance are not entirely understood. The internal structure of inversion zones is variable and depends on details in the pre-inversion setting, the inversion-inducing stress field, and the sedimentary fill. However, on a larger scale, most inversion zones share certain principal observational features, which sample the physical structure and the rheologic properties of the lithosphere and thereby provide an opportunity to test hypotheses of lithospheric rheology and dynamics. The quantitative model presented in this paper explains how inversion zones and the associated marginal troughs are related to lithospheric zones of differential shortening and regional isostatic compensation of the induced topography.},

abstract = {In-plane horizontal stresses acting on predeformed lithosphere induce differential flexural vertical motions. A high-precision record of these motions can be found in the sedimentary record of rifted basins. Originally, it was proposed that rifted basins experience flank uplift and basin center subsidence in response to a compressive change of in-plane stress, which agrees well with observed differential motions. Subsequently published models predicted that the vertical motions may be opposite because of the flexural state of the lithosphere induced by necking during extension. However, the total, flexural and permanent, geometry of the lithosphere underlying the rifted basin is the controlling parameter for the in-plane stress-caused vertical motions. The largest part of this preexisting geometry is caused by faulting in the uppermost brittle part of the crust and ductile deformation in the underlying parts of the lithosphere. We present a new multilayered model for stress-induced differential subsidence, taking into account the technically induced preexisting geometry of the lithosphere, including faults in the upper crust. As continental lithosphere may exhibit flexural decoupling due to a weak lower crustal layer, the new multilayer in-plane stress model discriminates the geometries of the separate competent layers. At a basin-wide scale, the new model predicts that a compressive change of in-plane force results in basin center subsidence and flank uplift, confirming the original hypothesis. Compared to all previous models, the new model requires a lower horizontal stress level change to explain observed differential vertical motions.},

abstract = {The geochemical evolution of the fluids migra- ting at the Variscan thrust front in eastern Belgium has been investigated by a petrographic, mineralogical and geoche-mical study of ankerite, quartz and ferroan calcite veins hosted by lower Devonian rocks. Three vein generations have been recognized. The first generation consists of quartz, chlorite and ankerite filling pre- to early Variscan extensional fractures. The second generation is present as shear veins of Variscan age, and contains quartz, chlorite and ferroan calcite. The third generation consists of ankerite filling post-Variscan fractures. The oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of the two ankerite phases and of the ferroan calcites are respectively between &#150;16.4 and &#150;11.4&#137; PDB between &#150;17.8 and &#150;1.7&#137; PDB. This range is greater than that of calcite nodules in the lower Devonian siliciclastic sediments (&#3918O= &#150;15.6 to &#150;11.1&#137; PDB and &#3913C= &#150;13.4 to &#150;10.2&#137; PDB). This suggests precipitation of the carbonate veins from a fluid which was at most only partly isotopically buffered by the calcite nodules in the host rock. The calculated oxygen isotopic composition of the ambient fluid from which the calcite veins formed is between +7.8 and +10.0&#137; SMOW. Two main fluid types have been recognized in fluid inclusions in the quartz and carbonates. The first fluid type is present as secondary fluid inclusions in the first and second vein generations. The fluid has a salinity of 0.5&#150;7.2 eq. wt.% NaCl and a high, but variable, homogenization temperature (Th=124&#150;188&#176;C). Two origins can be proposed for this fluid. It could have been expelled from the lower Devonian or could have been derived from the metamorphic zone to the south of the area studied. Taking into account the microthermometric and stable-isotope data, and the regional geological setting, the fluid most likely originated from metamorphic rocks and interacted with the lower Devonian along its migration path. This is in agreement with numerical simulations of the palaeofluid and especially the palaeotempera-ture field, which is based on chlorite geothermometry and vitrinite reflectance data. The second fluid type occurs as secondary inclusions in the shear veins and as fluid inclusions of unknown origin in post-Variscan ankerite veins. Therefore, it has a post-Variscan age. The inclusions are characterized by a high salinity (18.6&#150;22.9 eq. wt.% CaCl2). The composition of the fluid is similar to that which caused the development of Mississippi Valley-type Pb&#150;Zn deposits in Belgium.},

abstract = {A reconnaissance apatite fission track study was undertaken in eastern Ireland to evaluate the low temperature thermal history of Palaeozoic basement rocks outcropping adjacent to the Irish Sea basin. On a sampling transect across the lapetus suture zone the distributions of single grain ages and track lengths indicate cooling after maximum palaeotemperatures of between 80 and 100-110[deg]C at various times during the Early Tertiary (about 30-45 Ma). Although a significant component of Tertiary uplift and erosion is inferred in eastern Ireland from geological observations, maximum palaeotemperatures are interpreted as principally due to heat advection by gravity-driven groundwater flow following Early Tertiary uplift at about 60 Ma. This phase of fluid flow produced the localized remagnetization of the Palaeozoic basement and overlying Carboniferous limestones in north Co. Dublin. Limited sampling in eastern Ireland indicates extreme local heterogeneity in apatite age, also characteristic of apatite fission track results from northern England. Thus heterogeneity requires an annealing control, independent of the sample's thermal history, suggested to be the individual crystal uranium content and indirectly the effects of fluid flow.},

abstract = {The migration of abnormally warm, saline water through the Appalachian basin and North American midcontinent in Paleozoic time has been inferred from fluid inclusion studies, remagnetizations, and widespread potassic alteration. A time-dependent numerical model of fluid, heat and solute transport is used to evaluate the viability of topographically driven recharge as a mechanism for brine migration. The model represents a wedge-shaped sedimentary basin 400 km long by 6 km deep (maximum) with a basal aquifer 500 to 750 m thick overlain by a homogeneous aquitard. Temperature predicted by model simulations is found to be inconsistent with constraints inferred from fluid inclusion studies, unless average heat flow values greater than about 100 mW/m2 are used. Model simulations also lead to predictions of low heat flow and subsurface temperaure in recharge zones that are generally not observed in modern orogenic zones. The initial solute content of pore waters in the model basin is flushed out by fresh water entering in the recharge zone before fluid velocities high enough to produce significant warming of the discharge zone can develop. Model simulations with source terms reveal that basin sediments can provide enough solute to maintain hot, hypersaline brine migration for about 1 m.y., at most. High fluid velocity in the basal aquifer is required to carry heat to the basin margins, but the higher the fluid velocity, the more quickly the basin's supply of solute is exhausted. Consideration of these constraints implies that topographically driven recharge may be an effective mechanism to explain regional brine migration only if flow is focused from regional scale recharge zones into more spatially restricted discharge zones.},

abstract = {The North Sea is a major continental basin filled with early Paleozoic to Recent sediments. Though graben formation started in the Triassic, the last major period of extension occurred between the Middle Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous. Following the faulting and graben formation associated with this extension, subsidence within the central North Sea was widespread and uniform and has created a saucer-shaped sedimentary basin. This was filled successively by chalks, sandstones, and finally, during most of the Tertiary, by shales and mud-stones. We examined the subsidence of six wells down the middle and two on the flanks of the Central Graben. In the period of widespread steady subsidence the water-loaded basement depth in the middle increased by 1100-1400 m. On the flanks the basement subsided 600-700 m. We suggest that most of this subsidence results from the thermal relaxation of the lithosphere which was thinned during a Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous stretching of the crust. Assuming a crustal stretching and associated lithospheric thinning of between 50 and 100% in the middle and decreasing on either side, we obtained a good match to the observed amplitude and rate of subsidence. The Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous subsidence which is found within the graben proper we relate to the fault-controlled initial subsidence which occurred during the actual stretching. The measurd heat flow is compatible with such a stretching model. Though there is no seismic refraction data across the Central Graben, this model is strongly supported by evidence of a thinner crust under the Viking Graben to the north and the Witchground/Buchan Graben complex to the east. Using the above observations as the basis for a geological interpretation, we examined the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon potential of certain sedimentary horizons in the northern section of the Central Graben. In analyzing the various wells we extended previous work on the compaction correction to handle overpressuring and mixed lithologies in backstripping studies. Further, we expanded these methods to include the variation of thermal conductivity, and calculations of the degree of thermal maturation of the deposited sediments, through time.},

abstract = {From the analysis of geological, geodetic and geophysical data we provide clear evidence of seismogenic faults capable of producing large earthquakes in intraplate Europe. Previous studies (Paulissen, Vandenberghe & Gullentops 1985; Van den Berg et al. 1994; Geluk et al. 1994) have yielded some constraints on the rate of crustal deformation along the Roer Valley, a graben structure crossing the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, and have allowed us to address the fundamental questions: can intraplate earthquakes rupture the surface in this part of 'stable' continental Europe, and if so, what is their return period? Detailed palaeoseismic investigations have been carried out in Belgium along a 10 km long fault scarp which is the morphological expression of the Feldbiss Fault, the southwestern border fault of the Roer Graben Camelbeeck & Meghraoui 1996). The scarp is multiple and the frontal fault scarp offsets young deposits and alluvial terraces. Field investigations using geological and geomorphological methodologies combined with geophysical prospecting provide evidence of Holocene seismic surface faulting. From 14C dating it is suggested that the last earthquake along the fault scarp occurred between 610 AD and 890 AD. Levelling profiles across the scarp suggest that it produced a vertical coseismic displacement of 0.5-1 m along the scarp. If we suppose that the last surface-faulting earthquake ruptured the whole seismogenic layer (17 km thickness) over a minimum length (10 km) corresponding to the length of the Bree scarp with an average slip of 0.6 m, its seismic moment was at least 3.1x1018 N m (MW=6.3) for an average rigidity mu=3x1010 Pa. By estimating the offset of the main terrace of the Maas River by slippage along the Feldbiss Fault, we calculate the average Late Pleistocene vertical deformation rate as 0.08+-0.04 mm yr-1. Palaeoseismic information combining the trench and geomorphic observations suggests the occurrence of two surface-faulting earthquakes during the last 20 kyr. A third dates before 28-35 kyr BP. Then, if the time distribution of earthquakes is uniform, a return period of 12+-5 ka and a vertical deformation rate of 0.06+-0.04 mm yr-1 are inferred.},

The clays are studied at unusually deep depths for geotechnical purposes, which require caution when using geotechnical values from similar formations at shallower depths in Belgium and the UK.

Rock-water reactions, boiling and condensation processes influence the chemistry of the fluids. The composition of geothermal fluids ranges from that of gold-depositing, dilute waters to saline, oil-field brines; as such they form a link between these two aqueous systems. Techniques developed to examine the processes active in geothermal systems may find valuable application in gold exploration and hydrocarbon reservoir modelling. The concept of hydrological regime is introduced and applied to recognising deposits of geothermal activity, the level of preservation and permeable, potentially gold-bearing zones in ancient epithermal systems. Mixing models, such as Cl-enthalpy plots, and geothermometry can aid identification of breakthrough of edge waters and casing damage. Differences in the equilibration time of geothermometers may enable the thermal profile or history of the reservoir to be developed.

abstract = {A basin-scale hydrogeological study of the inverted northern Broad Fourteens Basin, Netherlands offshore, has resulted in a reconstruction of geological evolution, an estimate of Late Cretaceous topography and model scenarios of syn-inversion meteoric water infiltration. This study was performed in the scope of a basin-scale analysis of the hydrogeological setting and hydrodynamic evolution of the Broad Fourteens Basin.This analysis is aimed at obtaining quantitative knowledge of depositional history and hydrogeological parameters, and qualitative knowledge of hydrodynamic evolution of the Broad Fourteens Basin from Carboniferous to present-day.We present an overview of the tectonic and depositional history, the most likely hydrogeological setting and model scenarios of Late Cretaceous meteoric water infiltration in the northern Broad Fourteens area. We constructed a detailed south-west north-east geological cross-section of the present-day northern Broad Fourteens Basin, and reconstructed Late Cretaceous basin geometry and topography. Using this geometry in a numerical model of density-dependent topography-driven fluid flow, we modelled several scenarios of meteoric water infiltration with estimated ranges of basin-scale permeabilities and water table head. Results indicate that a deep freshwater lens was developed during Late Cretaceous inversion, if the basin-scale hydraulic conductivity of the Rijnland and Altena Groups was at least 1{\textperiodcentered}10–9 to 1{\textperiodcentered}10–10 m/s, which is in general the highest value for claystones.},

Sediments and metasediments deposited originally in shallow marine environments can contain fluids with a very wide range of salinities, but they are commonly near twice seawater salinity or higher. With increasing metamorphic grade, a very wide range of salinities may develop, with the highest levels tracking halite saturation. Oceanic and accretionary prism sequences yield low-salinity fluids, close to seawater values, almost irrespective of metamorphic grade until extreme conditions are reached where removal of water may increase fluid salinity. The salinities of metamorphic fluids exert a fundamental control on both fluid phase equilibria and metal-transporting capability, and appear, to a large degree, to reflect the original presence or absence of highly saline formation waters and/or evaporites in the initial sedimentary sequence.},

abstract = {Abstract  Faults in sedimentary rocks can act as fluid pathways or barriers to flow and display a range of deformation styles. These
features can be explained by behaviours observed in deformation experiments on sedimentary rocks that reveal a transition
from dilatant brittle faulting and permeability enhancement to cataclasis and permeability reduction, with increasing porosity,
grain size and confining pressure. This transition implies that faults in sedimentary rocks are unlikely to act as fluid pathways
shallower than $\sim$3 km, unless the sediments have undergone early cementation, or have been exposed following burial and uplift.
This has important implications for many geological processes, including fluid circulation in geothermal systems, formation
of sediment-hosted mineral deposits and earthquakes in subduction zones. Stratiform Zn–Pb deposits that have been interpreted
as syngenetic, seafloor deposits could instead be interpreted as early epigenetic deposits representing the depth at which
faults change from fluid pathways to barriers.},

abstract = {The thermal and burial history of the Herzkamp syncline, located in the transition zone between the Variscan Rhenish Massif and the Ruhr foreland basin (western Germany), was reconstructed using PDI/PC-1D-basin modelling software (IES). The models were calibrated with new vitrinite reflectance data measured on Palaeozoic outcrop samples. High sample density and quality of the calibration data allowed a 3D reconstruction of the heat flow as well as of burial and erosion history. Vitrinite reflectance values range from 0.8 to 4.9%Rr and generally increase with increasing stratigraphic age. The coalification pattern confirms pre-tectonic maturation, especially in the western part of the study area. A "low-coalification zone" showing stagnating/decreasing coalification with increasing stratigraphic age exists, however, northeast of the Ennepe thrust, indicating synorogenic coalification. This anomaly is explained by early thrusting in the northern Rhenish Massif resulting in restricted burial/early uplift and thus lower thermal maturity. One result of numerical modelling is that palaeo-heat flows during maximum burial (Westphalian or post-Westphalian) decreased southwards from approximately 65 to less than 50 mW/m2. Maximum burial depths for the base and top of the Namurian also decrease southwards from 7000 to 3600 m and 4600 to 1800 m, respectively, resulting in southwards-decreasing coalification of the respective stratigraphic horizon. Eroded overburden increases southwards (3100-5700 m), with the exception of the low-coalification zone, which is characterised by lower amounts of eroded overburden (1300-2900 m) and an earlier onset of erosion, i.e. in the Westphalian B rather than Westphalian D or post-Westphalian.},

The surface heat-flow map includes 553 determinations carried out on water and mining exploration wells, oil exploration wells and on the seafloor. The surface heat flow varies noticeably from the Iberian mainland (65 +/- 10 mW m-2) to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean margins, where the heat flow reaches values of about 40-50 mW m-2 and 80-100 mW m-2, respectively. The heat-production map consists of 664 determinations carried out on rock samples from the Variscan Iberian Massif and the Betics. The higher values are obtained for granitic rocks (2.5-3.5 [mu]W m-3), whereas metasediments and basic rocks reach values of 1-2.5 [mu]W m-3 and nearly zero, respectively. The lithospheric structure deduced for the Iberian Peninsula by combining heat-flow, heat-production and elevation data indicates that most of the Iberian mainland is characterized by a lithospheric thickness of 110 +/- 5 km. This value is maintained across the West Atlantic margin, whereas towards the Mediterranean margin, the lithospheric thickness decreases down to 60-40 km. This study also suggests that the heat production in the southern Variscan Iberian Massif must be noticeably higher (3.7 +/- 0.5 [mu]W m-3) than in the rest of the areas in order to fit the measured heat-flow, crustal thickness and elevation data.},

abstract = {It was suggested that brine of the Dead Sea rift has originated from a residual product of intensively evaporated seawater that invaded the rift, precipitated halite, and later interacted through dolomitization with the host rock during subsurface migration. Detection of this brine in many deep wells located at distances as far as 100 km away from the rift was attributed to long-distance migration of the brine. The physical feasibility of such migration, which probably spanned the past 3-6 m.y., is quantitatively tested and verified in this study by using paleohydrologic modeling. The structural formation of the rift is described by a chronological sequence of geologic cross sections serving as the basis for hydrodynamic calculations, which assess the effects of the structure on fluid migration, salinity redistribution, and heat transport across the sedimentary basin. Results indicate that two basin-scale ground-water systems, one atop the other but with opposite flow directions, coexisted in the Dead Sea rift valley. The first is a topography-driven flow of meteoric water from the surrounding highlands toward the rift through relatively shallow aquifers (≤ 1 km). The second is a density-driven migration of the Dead Sea brine through deep aquifers (4-5 km) in the opposite direction. The configuration of these flow systems has changed during the structural evolution of the Dead Sea rift, illustrating the interrelationships among basin formation, paleohydrology, and paleogeochemistry.},

The possible error in estimating equilibrium formation temperature by assuming the validity of the simplifications can be of the order of 10 K.

abstract = {Fluid flow patterns due to free thermal convection in permeable rock masses have been investigated for the 3D geological architecture around the Mount Isa lead-zinc-silver and copper deposits. Key results for the range of parameters explored here are: (1) Flow pattern and temperature distribution in stratigraphic units with homogeneous permeability are similar to those in units with the same average permeability in a heterogeneous distribution. (2) The geometry of one highly permeable stratigraphic unit governs fluid flow to an extent where it spatially attracts a convection cell, irrespective of the volume of adjacent permeable units. (3) Even in a complex and heterogeneous system with patches of low permeability along the fluid pathways, the Rayleigh number can be used to determine whether free convection will occur or not. Numerical simulations in 3D of coupled fluid flow and heat transfer were carried out using the finite difference computer code SHEMAT. Two different levels of permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Firstly, heterogeneity introduced by stratigraphy and secondly, various heterogeneous permeability distributions within geological units. Further complexity was created by defining patches with very low permeability within those stratigraphic units. The results show that free convection in hydrothermal systems is highly sensitive to the 3D permeability distribution in the geological architecture.},

abstract = {Inversion is dependent on pre-existing basin configuration in the initial subsidence, usually extensional phase, and the resolution of compressional forces in the later shortening phase. External horizontal, rather than isostatic vertical forces are required for inversion because many deep sediment-filled basins around the world have never been inverted, but should have been, if isostatic rebound were the driving mechanism. Inversion can range in scale from basins to sub-basins to selected structures within basins. Typically, rift basins can be later inverted. Mainly by reactivation of older normal faults, inversion selects rift basins where, in pure shear, weakening because of necking or thinning of lithosphere has occurred; and where, in simple shear, mechanical detachment surfaces are available for subsequent movement. Some pre-existing lows or sags can apparently be inverted in the absence of reactivated normal faults, as in the southern Altiplano of Bolivia and offshore Sabah, Borneo. Basins can be inverted by dominantly strike-slip with some convergent component, e.g. offshore northeast Brazil, and by almost direct compression, Atlas Mountains, Morocco. A prime difference is that convergent strike-slip can reactivate relatively high-angle normal faults as reverse faults, whereas these faults tend to lock when subjected to more direct compression which then creates lower angle contractional faults. Usually, inversion is caused by a combination of compression and strike-slip (transpression) because the azimuth of maximum principal compressional stress to the direction of original basin trend vectors into an oblique-slip component. This is illustrated in northern Argentina where compression derived from Andean deformation is resolved obliquely (about 45degrees) against an older rift basin in the foreland nearby. Interestingly, for this area at least, the 45degrees angle which affords an equal contribution of strike slip and compression results only in reactivation of older normal faults and does not create younger contractional features. Apparently compressive forces can be transmitted backward from the lead edge of an underthrusted foreland plate to invert rather remote regions and basins that are carried on that plate; this may be a significant part of the mechanism for basin inversion in northwest Europe and the southern North Sea as that foreland region underthrusted along the Alpine system.},

The verification of the GST assessment was accomplished by independent data from historical sources and the GST reconstructions in surrounding Slovakia and Slovenia. The long cold conditions in the Middle Ages and the absence of the Little Climatic Optimum seem to be generic feature of the climate in Hungary.

abstract = {Moving fluids are capable of transporting a large amount of heat over long distances in sedimentary basins, but the effects are often ignored when modelling the thermal evolution of sedimentary basins. If significant, the passage of these heated fluids through the sediment pile will leave a thermal signature which can be measured at the present-day using palaeotemperature determinants such as vitrinite reflectance and apatite fission track analysis (AFTATM). The interpretation of palaeotemperature-depth profiles, particularly the slope of a palaeotemperature-depth profile, i.e. the palaeogeothermal gradient, allows fluid-induced temperature profiles to be distinguished from those due to simple conduction of basal heat flow. Steady-state systems, typified by large-scale lateral fluid flow in foreland basins or where low-temperature hydrothermal circulation systems occur associated with intrusions and thick volcanic piles, are characterized by dog-length geothermal gradients, with high-interval gradients near the surface, above the shallowest aquifer, and lower interval gradients beneath an aquifer. It is argued that the classic occurrence of near vertical vitrinite reflectance-depth profiles observed in many ancient foreland basins can result from this mechanism. Thermal effects of transient fluid flow are most easily observed at the present-day, where they are characterized by low or negative geothermal gradients beneath aquifers in active geothermal systems, and the same criterion enables their recognition in ancient situations. Similarly, shallow-level igneous intrusion into porous and permeable sediments can produce observable thermal signatures further from the intrusion than will result from simple conduction, but which can be readily explained by movement of fluids heated by the intrusion. Complex steady-state profiles that may be difficult to distinguish from transient profiles without additional geological data may arise where multiple aquifers are separated by aquitards. The thermal consequences of fluid flow in two of these situations, a foreland basin and igneous intrusion into porous sediments, are illustrated by examples of thermal history reconstruction from the Pliocene Papua New Guinea Fold Belt and the Canning Basin of Australia, respectively.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 83201393 Spatial variations in the salinity of pore waters in sedimentary basins can provide important insight into basin-scale hydrogeologic processes. Although there have been numerous studies of brine seeps in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, much less is known about porewater salinities in the vast areas between seeps. A study has been made of spatial variation in pore water salinities in sediments in an approximately 500�km by 200�km area of the northern deep water (water depth >500�m) Gulf of Mexico sedimentary basin (GOM) to provide insight into pathways and mechanisms of solute transport in this portion of the basin. A second objective was to document salinities in the upper 500�m of the sedimentary section, the approximate depth to which methane hydrates, a potential future energy resource, may be stable. Elevated salinities would reduce the P2013T stability range of hydrates. Salinities were calculated from borehole logs using a dual electrical conductivity model. Even though much of the northern GOM is underlain by allochthonous salt most of the undisturbed shallow sedimentary section has not been permeated by hypersaline waters. These waters are limited to areas near brine seeps. Hypersaline waters having salinities in excess of 100�g�l22121 become more common at subseafloor depths of 2�km and greater. A field study at Green Canyon 65 and published numerical simulations of fluid flow above tabular salt bodies suggest that brines produced by salt dissolution migrate laterally and pond above salt and/or within minibasins and that the dominant mechanism of vertical solute transport is a combination of compaction-driven advection and diffusion, not large-scale thermohaline overturn. Superimposed on this diffuse upward flux of dissolved salt is the more focused and localized expulsion of saline fluids up faults.},

The extension ([beta]) for the syn-rift section of 1.2-1.3 is considerably smaller than that estimated from the post-rift section ([beta]=2-2.4). This appears to represent a real discrepancy, rather than just a problem with accurate measurement of extension in the syn-rift section. The syn-rift section, particularly in the northern half of the Pattani Basin, has an overall synformal geometry atypical of rifts. Not all the syn-rift subsidence can be modelled as extension-related (unlike typical half grabens). Consequently it is proposed that the Pattani Basin developed due to both extensional faulting, and as a synformal basin developed over a ramp-flat geometry along a major low-angled extensional fault in the upper crust. Overall the discrepancy in upper crustal extension estimated from forward modelling vs. ductile lithspheric extension estimated from backstripping suggests that active mantle processes (e.g. a mantle plume) or non-uniform extension (subduction rollback) operated beneath the Gulf of Thailand.},

abstract = {Although studies of free convection commonly focus on highly permeable strata, but numerical analyses indicate that density-driven free convection may also occur in heterogeneous low-permeability strata. Traditional Rayleigh number criteria are overly conservative in predicting thermohaline convection in these systems; so, numerical models are used to make inferences on the process. Simulations with stochastic realizations of permeability fields show that dense plumes can take preferential pathways to sink through generally low-permeability strata; patch analysis using percolation theory shows that the threshold permeability for the onset of free convection can be as low as 10221216�m2 even with a mean permeability of 10221218�m2. Threshold permeability for the percolation pathways decreases with increasing concentration gradient, vertical correlation length and the mean and variance of the permeability. The connectedness of relatively high-permeability zones is important in initiating and controlling plume fingers of free convection in both single-layer and sand-shale sequence models. Permeable units above and below are conducive to free convection through intervening low-permeability strata if buoyancy gradients exist. This heterogeneity is on scales that are difficult to sample by drilling and too localized to be simulated in regional models but may be significant in solute transport in these systems.},

Relatively small scale non-glacial catchments are replaced by catchments which are integrated on the scale of continental ice sheets. Simulations are presented of the response to glaciation of a large part of the western European groundwater system during the last two (Saalian, Weichselian) glacial cycles. A two-dimensional model along an ice sheet flowline from western Sweden to The Netherlands illustrates the impact of glaciation on flow in the vertical plane, and a vertically integrated model illustrates its impact on areal patterns of flow. Hydraulics heads, hydraulic gradients and flow velocities are increased far above their modern values, and relatively shallow aquifers are completely flushed out during glacial periods. There are significant implications for groundwater chemistry and geological structures. Large seepage pressures generated near to ice sheet margins and major impacts on the distribution of effective pressures will produce structures such as hydrofractures, sediment dykes, sediment volcanoes, loading structures etc. The model can be readily applied to hydrocarbon resorvoirs.},

abstract = {The European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) transects Variscan basement, Permo-Carboniferous troughs and Late Permian to Mesozoic series, deposited in thermal sag basins, which are exposed on rift-related arches. We have analysed processes governing the transformation of the orogenically destabilized Variscan lithosphere into end-Cretaceous stabilized cratonic lithosphere, prior to its renewed Cenozoic rift-related destabilization. In the ECRIS area, crustal and lithospheric thicknesses at present are in the range of 24-35 km and 60-120 km, respectively. The Variscan orogen was characterized at the time of its end-Westphalian consolidation by 45-60 km deep crustal roots, marking major sutures. During the Stephanian-Early Permian wrench-induced collapse of the Variscan orogen, subducted lithospheric slabs were detached, causing upwelling of the asthenosphere, thermal thinning and/or partial delamina-tion of the lithospheric mantle, and regional uplift. By mid-Permian times, the crust was thinned to 28-35 km owing to its regional erosional unroofing, localized mechanical stretching and the interaction of mantle-derived melts with its basal parts. By mid-Permian times, when the temperature of the asthenosphere returned to ambient levels, thermal subsidence of the lithosphere commenced, controlling development of a system of Late Permian and Mesozoic intracratonic basins. These experienced repeated minor subsidence accelerations, related to the build-up of far-field stresses, which did not involve renewed lithospheric destabilization. Modelling of observed subsidence curves indicates that during the mid-Permian lithospheric thicknesses ranged in the ECRIS area between 40 and 80 km, but had increased by the end of the Cretaceous to 100-120 km. Cenozoic rifting and mantle-plume activity caused renewed lithospheric thinning.},

abstract = {The Tertiary development of the Norwegian continental margin was dominated by the opening of the Arctic-North Atlantic Ocean. The correct identification of magnetic anomalies and their ages and the analysis of spreading rates during the formation of this ocean are important in understanding the development of the region and specifically the history of its passive margins. Three ocean domains, the Aegir, Reykjanes and Mohns regions, were investigated in an effort to understand the lateral changes in structural development of the passive margin after continental break-up. Spreading rates generally slowed down from 2 cm a-1 after Early Eocene initiation of sea-floor spreading, to values around 0.5 cm a-1 in Oligocene time. An increase in spreading rates to around 1 cm a-1 coincided with the positioning of the Iceland hotspot under the North Atlantic mid-ocean ridge. At the same time, the European plate changed its absolute plate motion from a north-directed drift to a motion more towards the east. The location of inversion structures in the Voring and Faeroes Basin rather than in the More Basin is related to differences in spreading rates. The Mohns and the Reykjanes Ridges produced more ocean floor than the Aegir-Kolbeinsey Ridges. Asymmetric ocean-floor formation in the Aegir Ridge led to differential stress at the base of the lithosphere, which probably explains the absence of inversion features in the More Basin (less mantle drag). Furthermore, upper plate margins such as the Voring Basin and possibly the Faeroe Basin have a lower compressional strength than lower plate margins such as the More Basin, and therefore preferentially developed inversion structures. Along the transform boundaries separating the domains, additional stress probably built up along extension of the transform zones into the extended continental crust. This additional stress probably also assisted initiation of the inversion structures in the Voring Basin and the Faeroes area. The amplification of the inversion structures in the Voring Basin and the Faeroes Basin was subsequently caused by a variety of processes related to sedimentation and uplift-erosion.},

abstract = {During contact metamorphism, fluid production from magma and wall rocks, thermal expansion of fluid, thermal and chemical buoyancy, topography, and deformation of rocks all interact to drive fluid flow. An understanding of how these processes interact is necessary to predict the evolution of fluid flow, fluid pressures, and permeability; to evaluate mechanisms of ore deposition, metasomatism, and heat transfer; and to apply petrologic, field, and geochemical data to infer hydrologic histories. Results from finite-difference models that account for many of these processes reveal the hydrodynamics of contact metamorphism. A systematic evolution in flow system from lithostatic fluid pressures and expulsion of internally generated fluids, to hydrostatic fluid pressures and circulation of externally derived fluids is predicted to occur with time, increasing permeability, and decreasing depth. Fluid production from magmas and wall rocks is the dominant process elevating fluid pressures toward lithostatic values during prograde metamorphism; other processes, such as strain or thermal expansion of the fluid, are less significant. For typical water contents of magmas and wall rocks, permeabilities of 2 ) are required to produce lithostatic fluid pressures in the aureole. Consideration of processes controlling permeability suggests that fluid flow is likely intergranular during prograde metamorphism and channelized during retrograde metamorphism. Balance of rates of thermal fracturing and mineral deposition implies that permeability should increase above 1 mu d during cooling, and thus fluid pressures should drop abruptly toward hydrostatic values once cooling and fracturing ensues. Rocks near the contact cool first, and complex mixing of magmatic, metamorphic, and meteoric fluids is likely in this region. If permeability increases during cooling, meteoric fluids may dominate the total fluid budget even though rocks interact with only magmatic and metamorphic fluids during prograde metamorphism. Many broad features of the models are similar to patterns observed in porphyry copper deposits. Models with ad hoc assumptions of permeability near the contact are required to produce significant up-temperature fluid flow during prograde metamorphism, a pattern predicted from some reaction-transport models.},

abstract = {As numerous studies have demonstrated, groundwater flow can have a significant impact on subsurface temperatures, and therefore also on exhumation histories derived from thermochronological studies. Our research aims to quantify this influence by including fluid flow in numerical models for the thermal behaviour of the crust and sediments. These models will be applied to the Roer Valley Graben in the southern Netherlands. One of the parameters to consider in this research are variations in recharge and discharge rates in the area. Commonly, numerical simulations of groundwater flow on basin scales represent the upper model boundary by a fixed hydraulic head at the position of the water table. This approach does not impose any constraints on recharge and discharge rates at the upper model boundary and could therefore lead to unrealistic estimates of the thermal effects of groundwater flow. To evaluate the potential effect of recharge on subsurface temperatures a parameter sensitivity study was conducted using a 2D numerical model of groundwater and heat flow. As a first step, the sensitivity analysis was conducted on a synthetic 20 km wide and 12 km deep basin, with a variation in water table elevation of 100 m. Preliminary results indicate that recharge can have a significant effect on subsurface temperatures. Using best estimates of recharge and permeability, the simulated advective cooling reaches values of up to 10 °C, and is mainly confined to the upper 2 km of the model domain. A fixed hydraulic head boundary condition can lead to values of groundwater recharge which are unrealistic given best estimates of the bandwith of recharge during geological history. Permeabilties of the upper part of the model of ≤10-14 m2 result in unrealistically low values of recharge (less than 10 mm/yr), while permeabilities of ≥10-11 m2 can result in recharge values in excess of 1000 mm/yr. These recharge rates can lead to underestimation or overestimation of advective cooling that exceed a factor of 4. Both recharge and the thermal effects of recharge are highly sensitive to the variation of permeability with depth. The sensitivity of recharge to anisotropy and water table elevation is much lower, although both parameters can still have a large impact on subsurface temperatures. The preliminary conclusion is that we will have to incorporate a more realistic representation of recharge in the model for our research-objectives. In addition to an improved description of recharge, we will incorporate the influence of faults and of groundwater salinity gradients on fluid flow. The models will be used to quantify to what extent fluid flow can explain subsurface temperatures as well as paleo-geothermal gradients inferred from apatite fission tracks from several borehole samples. Constraints will be based on a large geological dataset including approximately 100 boreholes and over 1000 km of seismic lines, as well as data and a large number of previous studies on stratigraphy, fluid flow during geological history and subsurface temperatures. The effects of groundwater flow on the thermal structure of the crust will be compared to the effect of other thermal processes, such as conduction, advection, heat production, topographic changes, fault movements, erosion and sedimentation.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional model is used to investigate the relationship between land subsidence and compaction of basin sediments in response to sediment loading. Analysis of the model equations and numerical experiments demonstrate quasi-linear systems behaviour and show that rates of land subsidence due to compaction: (i) can attain a significant fraction (\textgreater40%) of the long-term sedimentation rate; (ii) are hydrodynamically delayed with respect to sediment loading. The delay is controlled by a compaction response time $\tau$c that can reach values of 10-5-107 yr for thick shale sequences. Both the behaviour of single sediment layers and multiple-layer systems are analysed. Subsequently the model is applied to the coastal area of the Netherlands to illustrate that lateral variability in compaction-derived land subsidence in sedimentary basins largely reflects the spatial variability in both sediment loading and compaction response time. Typical rates of compaction-derived subsidence predicted by the model are of the order of 0.1 mm/yr but may reach values in excess of 1 mm/yr under favourable conditions.},

abstract = {The forces that drove rock uplift of the low-relief, high-elevation, tectonically stable Colorado Plateau are the subject of long-standing debate(1-5). While the adjacent Basin and Range province and Rio Grande rift province underwent Cenozoic shortening followed by extension(6), the plateau experienced similar to 2km of rock uplift(7) without significant internal deformation(2-4). Here we propose that warming of the thicker, more iron-depleted Colorado Plateau lithosphere(8-10) over 35-40 Myr following mid-Cenozoic removal of the Farallon plate from beneath North America(11,12) is the primary mechanism driving rock uplift. In our model, conductive re-equilibration not only explains the rock uplift of the plateau, but also provides a robust geodynamic interpretation of observed contrasts between the Colorado Plateau margins and the plateau interior. In particular, the model matches the encroachment of Cenozoic magmatism from the margins towards the plateau interior at rates of 3-6 km Myr(-1) and is consistent with lower seismic velocities(13) and more negative Bouguer gravity(14) at the margins than in the plateau interior. We suggest that warming of heterogeneous lithosphere is a powerful mechanism for driving epeirogenic rock uplift of the Colorado Plateau and may be of general importance in plate-interior settings.},

abstract = {Recent advances in understanding how faults restrict fluid flow in sandstone reservoirs have led to improved models for reservoir simulation. Nevertheless, there are still many uncertainty factors that can render even the most detailed simulation model useless. On a detailed scale, these uncertainties include variations in lateral continuity of faults, properties and thickness of fault zones, and the influence of deformation bands within and outside damage zones. Subseismic features such as small-scale relay zones, drag features and frequency and distribution of small faults around the fault zone further decrease the confidence level of simulation modelling results. Detailed analyses of seismic and well data from the Gullfaks Field, Northern North Sea, have helped understand the detailed structural reservoir characteristics. The results from these analyses can, in many cases, be used as input to further enhance models for reservoir simulation in order to increase the validation of the models. Furthermore, the studies carried out on the Gullfaks Field demonstrate that a sound approach to knowledge management for increased oil recovery based on fault seal analysis requires sharing of gained knowledge from many oil and gas fields rather than monopolizing information that cannot be fully utilized by studies from a single field.},

Consequently, advective heat transport by topography-driven fluid flow can modify the crustal thermal field and bias exhumation rates calculated from thermochronometer data. Although previous studies have considered the thermal effects of fluid flow, none has quantified the influence on thermochronometer ages. We use a steady-state three-dimensional coupled hydraulic thermokinematic finite-element model to simulate the influence of fluid flow on exhumation rates derived from thermochronometer data in the Nepalese Himalaya. Local hot springs suggest substantial heat transport by fluid flow and are adjacent to apatite fission-track samples. Model hydraulic conductivity controls the rate of fluid flow, and values characteristic of fractured rock (&#62;&#62;10&#8722;9 m/s) yield a fluid advection&#8211;dominated thermal field.

Radiometric ages and fault rocks associated with the Lugano-Val Grande normal fault demonstrate that cooling rather than heating affected the crust during normal faulting. This pattern is not compatible with such a simple numerical model and is explained by a waning thermal anomaly induced by a magmatic intrusion immediately preceding or overlapping with the first stages of normal faulting. The magmatic body must have been emplaced at depths greater than 15-18 km, and probably started to cool in the Carnian i.e. few million years before the onset of normal faulting along the Lugano-Val Grande fault.},

abstract = {In the Netherlands offshore sector, available data and knowledge of the sediments of the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary (Danian) Chalk Group is limited due to its hitherto restricted significance as a hydrocarbon reservoir. For example, the stratigraphic subdivision of the Chalk in this area comprises only three formations, i.e. the Cenomanian Texel Formation (CKTX), the Turonian to Maastrichtian Ommelanden Formation (CKGR) and the Danian Ekofisk Formation (CKEK), contrary to more detailed subdivisions used in sectors where the Chalk does form an important hydrocarbon-producing interval. The first aim of this thesis is, therefore, to present a more detailed subdivision of the Chalk Group in the Dutch North Sea sector. Due to the scarcity of cored intervals and biostratigraphical data, this subdivision is largely based on the interpretation of geophysical data. The chalks of the North Sea area show a great variety of lithofacies resulting from a broad spectrum of depositional mechanisms and physical and chemical compaction processes. Chalk was originally formed by settling of calcareous nannoplankton remains from suspension in the water column. However, in areas that underwent significant tectonic activity, slope instability processes resulted in resedimentation of the autochthonous chalk. Investigation of these sedimentary processes, as well as their controls and products, not only yields additional information on the sedimentology and diagenesis of the Chalk Group, but also on the paleoenvironmental and basinal evolution of the study area during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleocene. Therefore, the second aim of this thesis is to reconstruct the sedimentary development of the Chalk Group in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. Although the Chalk Group is characterised by a remarkably uniform lithology, marked lateral variations in acoustic velocity are present throughout the North Sea basin. These acoustic velocity variations are primarily the result of variations in compaction, which in turn are caused by spatial differences in burial history. A better understanding of the spatial variation of seismic velocity therefore yields information about the compaction of the Chalk, the burial history of the sediment and helps to improve time-depth conversions through this interval. The third aim of this thesis is, therefore, to explain the regional variations in seismic velocity of the Chalk. The sedimentary development and seismostratigraphy of the Chalk were studied by seismic interpretation and well log correlation of this interval throughout the Dutch offshore area. The results are described in Chapter 2 Improved subdivision of the Chalk Group through mapping and facies analysis of seismic sequences. By integrating the results of Chapter 2, the regional tectono-sedimentary development of the Netherlands North Sea sector during the Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene was reconstructed, as described in Chapter 3, Cenomanian to Danian tectono-sedimentary development of the Netherlands North Sea area. Cyclicities in well log response, inferring sedimentary processes (pelagic vs. reworking) and sedimentation rates are discussed in Chapter 4, Meter-scale cyclicity in well logs of the Chalk Group, southern North Sea. The burial history of the Chalk Group, as studied by investigating acoustic velocities, is described in Chapter 5, Acoustic velocity and burial history analysis of the Chalk Group, Netherlands offshore. Chapter 6 Synthesis summarises the results.},

abstract = {Measurements of dispersed vitrinite along several exploration wells within the northern Rhinegraben are indicative of a thermal graben history that is influenced by a combination of basal conductive and groundwater-flow related convective heat transfer. To determine the conductive/convective components of heat transfer within the rift today, a series of 2D numerical groundwater flow and heat models are developed along a cross-sectional transect across the northern Rhinegraben. Fault zone permeability is varied in the simulations of these models to determine the possible fluid pathways and the effects of circulating groundwater on the graben temperature field. Depending on the fault permeability, negative thermal anomalies always develop in areas of cold recharging groundwater along the graben flanks regardless of fault permeability, whereas hot discharging groundwater near the topographic low of the graben only results in positive thermal anomalies under the assumption of high fault permeability. Simulation results suggest that the modern groundwater flow system has an overall net cooling effect on the temperature field of the rift.Without convective cooling by groundwater, vitrinite reflectance levels in wells would be expected to be much higher on average than are observed. Although relatively high heat flow densities (100 mW/m2) are documented in the Rhinegraben, an average of only 65 mW/m2 would be sufficient to produce the observed vitrinite reflectance levels. Thus, a long-lived (\textgreater10 My) cooling convective fluid flow in combination with a high basal heat flow seems to be active.},

abstract = {The Dead Sea rift valley is a left-lateral transform, along which several rhomb-shaped grabens were formed. At the Sea of Galilee, which is one of these rhomb-shaped grabens, ambiguous heat fluxes were measured: 70&#8211;80 mW&#47;m2 at the central part of the lake, 36 mW&#47;m2 at the lake&#39;s southern coast (10 km apart), and most surprising, about 135 mW&#47;m2 at the southern Golan Heights, 6&#8211;8 km east of the graben margin. A detailed geologic cross section, traversing the entire sedimentary basin, was constructed. The hydrodynamics in this cross section were analyzed quantitatively using a two-dimensional finite element code that solves the coupled variable-density ground-water flow and conductive-convective heat transfer equations. On the basis of numerical simulations, different mechanisms of basin-scale ground-water convection are suggested for the two sides of the rift that could influence the transport of heat: (1) forced convection (gravity-driven flow) of hot brines from deeper aquifers to the land surface at the western side; and (2) large-scale free convection (buoyancy-driven flow) of deep ground water at the eastern side. The different heat fluxes within the rift valley are attributed to the different lithologies and to the locations of specific conduits through which the hot ground waters ascend from deeper horizons. These simulations also explain the different salinities of the hot springs on the two sides of the rift.},

At moderate to great crustal depths (\textgreater 5 km), this curve is defined mainly by data from prograde metamorphic systems, and is thus applicable to orogenic belts where the crust is being thickened andsolor heated; lower permeabilities may occur in stable cratonic regions. This k-z relation implies that typical metamorphic fluid flux values of 10-11 msols are consistent with fluid pressures significantly above hydrostatic values. The k-z curve also predicts that metamorphic CO2 flux from large orogens may be sufficient to cause significant climatic effects, if retrograde carbonation reactions are minimal, and suggests a significant capacity for diffuse degassing of Earth (1015-1016 gsolyr) in tectonically active regions.},

abstract = {A wide diversity of techniques is now available to help constrain the timing and duration of fluid flow events and fluid-rock interactions in sedimentary basins. Dating methods in rocks traditionally focus on the use of minerals that contain radiogenic isotopes (U-Pb, Pb-Pb, K-Ar, Rb-Sr in particular). I do not intend to dwell on this approach as it is covered adequately elsewhere (e.g. Faure 1986), but it is worthwhile emphasizing that certain phases that are commonly precipitated during diagenesis in sedimentary basins are suitable for such techniques (see below). The range of techniques summarized below were mostly presented in a Queen's University Geofluids Group International Seminar on Dating of Fluid Flow, incorporated within the Geofluids II conference held at Belfast in March 1997.  There is a limited range of parameters within rocks or minerals which change with time, and which can therefore be used to deduce an age of formation for epigenetic mineral phases. The processes of radioactive decay yield predictable quantities of daughter products (radiometric dating) and particles whose pathways can be observed and whose annealling behaviour is predictable (fission track analysis). In addition we can measure the effects of movement over the Earth's surface relative to her magnetic field along a well-known polar-wander curve (palaeomagnetism). In some cases we can measure a record of contemporary seawater chemistry that can be related to a well established database of changing stable isotope composition. Furthermore, in young rocks we can measure the consequences of other physico-chemical reactions that are kinetically controlled (electron spin resonance).  ...

abstract = {In most deep sedimentary basins in the world, there is a layered arrangement of at least two superimposed hydrogeological systems. The shallowest hydrogeological system can extend to great depths; however, in many basins it extends from the surface down to only about 10,000 ft greatest historical depth of burial. The shallow hydrogeological systems generally are basin-wide in extent and exhibit normal pressures. The pore water apparently is free to migrate approximately in accordance with the theory of fluid migration proposed by Munn (1909) and quantified by Hubbert (1940 and 1953). The deeper hydrogeological systems usually are not basin-wide in extent and exhibit abnormal pressures. They generally consist of a layer of individual fluid compartments which are sealed off from each other and from the overlying system. In some basins, mainly in the onshore U.S., there is an even deeper, near normally pressured noncompartmented section. The compartmented layer in those basins generally is in the sequence of rocks which were deposited during the period of most rapid deposition. The underlying noncompartmented layer, where present, usually is in prebasin shelf deposits and basement rock. The uppermost noncompartmented layer usually is in rocks which were deposited during the last 10,000 ft in basin filling. Correlations of petroleum in reservoirs with the rocks from which the petroleum was generated has imposed a system of mainly upwards paths for the first several thousand feet of migration of petroleum from source rocks largely within the compartmented layer to pools generally in the shallow hydrogeological system. The migration paths of petroleum and water may not be coincident.},

annote = { The relationship between reduced track density, [varrho]/[varrho]0, and reduced mean confined track length, L/L0, during annealing has been studied for both spontaneous and induced tracks in four apatite samples with different chemical composition, compositional range, and origin, and with spontaneous tracks giving mean confined track lengths varying from \textasciitilde 14.5 [mu]m down to 12.3 [mu]m. In all four apatites, induced tracks show a relationship between L/L0 and [varrho]/[varrho]0 composed of two regions; at higher values the two appear to be equal, while at lower values L/L0 is greater than [varrho]/[varrho]0. This can be understood qualitatively in terms of the anisotropy of annealing and the bias against revelation of short tracks. Data from three apatites of uniform composition show near-identical relationships. In a sample showing a range of apatite compositions, the point of divergence from the 1:1 relationship is somewhat higher than in the uniform composition apatites, because individual grains anneal at different rates, and the presence of highly annealed grains affects the track density more strongly than the mean track length. Spontaneous tracks show similar relationships to those observed for induced tracks in each sample, when the data are renormalised to allow for the natural annealing present in the spontaneous tracks. Previous studies which led to the idea of length reduction without density reduction for spontaneous tracks did not renormalise density data as well as length data, thereby distorting the apparent relationship. Data for the multi-compositional apatite sample where annealing has taken place in geological conditions also agrees with the laboratory annealing data for both spontaneous and induced tracks. This consistency suggests that a single process is responsible in all three cases, implying that a laboratory-based description of annealing can be applied to geological conditions with confidence. Recognition that spontaneous tracks in apatite are commonly annealed suggests that, in general, the fission track age should be interpreted as a reflection of both the time over which tracks have been retained and the distribution of etchable track lengths. Since the latter is a manifestation of the thermal history, the fission track age should be interpreted in similar terms.},

The Modified Scherer Model (MSM) has many advantages over the depth-dependent Sclater-Christie (Athy) and Falvey-Middleton equations used for calculating porosity in 1-D modeling, because it predicts major differences resulting from age, sedimentation rate, sandstone composition, and pressure that are not considered in depth-dependent models. The only additional information required by the MSM is quartz content and Trask sorting coefficient. If these are not known, they may be estimated with reasonable confidence. The Modified Scherer Method could be added easily to existing software packages for 1-D modeling. It also may prove useful for making preliminary estimates of reservoir porosity (including timing of porosity loss), especially in early stages of exploration.},

abstract = {The conversion of biogenic silica (opal-A) to opal-CT (cristobalite and tridymite) in biosiliceous sediment causes increased rates of water expulsion because of the reduction in sediment porosity and dehydration of the amorphous opal-A phase. This release of water occurs over large tracts of sedimentary basins during sediment burial within discrete, diagenetic, reaction zones. Analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional seismic data sets from basins in the Northern Hemisphere provides geophysical evidence for a variety of fluid conduits and roughly circular erosional depressions at the contemporaneous seabed. We interpret these features as indicative of water expulsion and focused fluid flow emanating from opal-A to opal-CT reaction zones at burial depths within the range 200-800 m. The rate at which water is expelled depends upon the degree of porosity reduction and the weight fraction of bound water at the reaction zone as well as the rate of advance of the reaction zone. Where the reaction is actively taking place within homogeneous biosiliceous sediment, the rate of water expulsion is independent of the reaction rate. This is because water is released across the entire reaction zone; therefore, slow reaction rates are compensated for by expulsion of water across wider reaction zones. We calculate the rate and volume of water expulsion for the Faeroe-Shetland Basin, where the sediment immediately below the reaction zone contains, on average, [\textasciitilde]30% opal-CT by weight. The estimated volumetric rate of water expulsion per unit surface area at the present day is [\textasciitilde]6 m3 My-1 per square meter, which is greater than the vertical flux of water at the same depth from compaction of the deeper basin fill. The average volumetric rate of water expulsion is [\textasciitilde]120 km3 My-1 across the whole basin. Biogenic silica is particularly rich in Neogene successions in high latitude and equatorial regions, and where silica reaction zones are identified, they should be factored into sediment compaction and fluid-flow histories.},

abstract = {An unconformity is present close to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary in the onshore and nearshore portions of the Otway, Port Phillip-Torquay, and Gippsland basins of southeast Australia. The unconformity is angular (generally \textless 1-5degrees angularity), with the underlying Miocene units having been deformed (gentle folding and reverse faulting) and eroded prior to deposition of the Pliocene succession. The unconformity also marks a change from Oligocene-Miocene deposition of cool-water carbonate sediments and brown coal-bearing successions to the accumulation of more siliciclastic-rich sediments in Pliocene time. The Miocene-Pliocene boundary therefore represents an interval of significant regional uplift in the southeast Australian basins. The amount of section removed is greatest around the Otway and Strzelecki ranges in Victoria, where up to a kilometer of section may have been removed. In most onshore sections of the Victorian basins hundreds of meters of section have been eroded. In distal offshore locations the boundary becomes conformable. The timing of uplift and erosion is best constrained in the Otway and Port Phillip basins, where late Miocene (N16 [\textasciitilde] 10 Ma) sediments underlie the unconformity and earliest Pliocene ([\textasciitilde] 5 Ma) sediments overlie it. This timing coincides with a change in the dynamics of the Australian plate, beginning at around 12 Ma. Southeast Australia is currently under a NW-SE compressional regime, and this has probably persisted since the late Miocene. In the basins (as opposed to the basement-dominated highland areas), the late Miocene uplift event is more significant than later Pliocene-Recent uplift.},

abstract = {During the latest Miocene and Early Pliocene ( 5.5. MaBP), the collision of the Australian and Eurasian plates resulted in proto-foreland development and significant structural reactivation in the Timor Sea, north-western Australia. Flexural extension, resulting from the down-warping of the Australian plate into the developing Timor Trough, resulted in the dilatation of the major Jurassic and older extensional faults and the formation of shallow Mio-Pliocene fault arrays. An integrated, multidisciplinary study of hydrocarbon traps from this region using 2-D and 3-D seismic data, stable isotope geochemistry, fluid inclusion measurements and apatite fission track data has revealed that this fault reactivation produced three categories of traps: high (HIT), moderate (MIT) and low (LIT) integrity traps. These have characteristic hydrocarbon fill-spill, fluid flow and thermal histories. In MITs and LITs, the dilatation was moderate to intense respectively, and allowed hot (90-130[deg]C), highly saline (200,000+ ppm salinity) brines from deep Palaeozoic evaporites to migrate up the reactivated faults and chemically and thermally affect the reservoir and shallower intervals. Apatite fission track data suggest that fluid migration lasted for between 100,000 and one million years in the case of the MITs, but for only 10,000-100,000 years in the LITs. This major fluid flow event resulted in the development of a prominent, localised Late Tertiary heating spike in the MITs, which can significantly affect the accuracy of modelled thermal histories. In the LITs, the thermal effect is less marked, due to the more transient nature of the fluid flow event. HITs were largely unreactivated and hence conduits for brine migration from depth were absent. Consequently, these traps are the most representative of the thermal histories of the source rock depocentres. Where MITS or LITs were charged, the associated loss of fault seal integrity facilitated hydrocarbon loss from the Mesozoic reservoirs, which co-migrated with the brines up through the Mio-Pliocene fault network. Upon entering a shallow, clastic aquifer system (the Eocene Grebe Formation), bacterial oxidation of the hydrocarbons liberated CO2 which, in turn, resulted in significant and very isotopically light carbonate cementation. This cementation produces sufficient acoustic impedance with the surrounding uncemented sands that it allows these hydrocarbon-related diagenetic zones (HRDZs) to be mapped seismically. Since both the size and acoustic response of the HRDZs are directly proportional to the amount of hydrocarbons that have leaked from the traps, their presence or absence provides a powerful indicator, predrill, of both trap integrity and the likely thermal regime that that traps have experienced. An important observation is that the leaky fault segments over partially breached traps typically only extended for 200-1000 m, whereas over the breached traps, leaky segments extended for 3000-5000 m. Consequently, exploration programs acquiring remote sensing geochemical data (such as geochemical sniffer and airborne laser fluorosensor (ALF) techniques), should have closely spaced line spacings if leaky, potentially commercial fields are to be detected reliably. Potential analogues exist between the processes documented during HRDZ formation, namely the mixing at shallow depths of basinal brines, hydrocarbons and connate waters, and processes occurring during the formation of Pb-Zn and other, low temperature ore deposits.},

abstract = {Northwestern Europe is tectonically more active, in terms of seismicity, vertical motions and volcanism, than would be expected from its location far from any plate boundaries. In the context of the Netherlands Earth System Dynamics Initiative, we investigated the implications of two recent modeling efforts, of Eurasian plate forces and European mantle structure, for our understanding of the dynamics of these intraplate tectonics. We find that: (1) a simple balance between ridge push and collision forces along the southern European boundary does not seem sufficient to explain the observed direction of maximum horizontal compression in northwestern Europe. Our stress model, which imposes dynamical equilibrium on the full Eurasian plate, predicts that collision forces along the African-European boundary are relatively weak and have only a minor effect on the stress field in northwestern Europe; (2) seismic velocity anomalies in the shallow mantle imply 100-300[degree sign]C variations in temperature under northwestern Europe. This regional mantle structure probably plays a significant role in the high level of intraplate tectonic activity and the regional variations in stress and tectonic style. For most tectonically active areas in Europe, observed surface heat flow anomalies coincide with anomalies in mantle velocity. Low velocity anomalies under northwestern Europe coincide with areas of recent volcanism and uplift, but are offset from the regions of maximum surface heat flow. This suggests that the thermal regime of the central European lithosphere is not in a steady state, probably due to changing mantle conditions. The effect of strong variations in lithospheric strength, predicted from the modeled thermal gradients in the shallow mantle, and of dynamic stresses induced by proposed active mantle upwellings may account for (some of) the differences between the observed and modeled stress field and will be investigated in future stress models.},

abstract = {Even when geologically based methods are used to determine fault rock permeabilities and thicknesses for input into flow simulators, a wide range of simplifying assumptions regarding fault structure and content are still present. Many of these assumptions are addressed by defining quantitative and flexible methods for realistic parameterization of fault-related uncertainties, and by defining automated methods for including these effects routinely in full-field flow simulation modelling. The fault effects considered include: the two-phase properties of fault rocks; the spatial distributions of naturally variable or uncertain single-phase fault rock properties and fault throws; and the frequencies and properties of sub-resolution fault system or fault zone complexities, including sub-seismic faults, normal drag and damage zones, paired slip surfaces and fault relay zones. Innovative two-phase or geometrical upscaling approaches implemented in a reservoir simulator preprocessor provide transmissibility solutions incorporating the effect, but represented within the geometrical framework of the full-field flow simulation model. The solutions and flexible workflows are applied and discussed within the context of a sensitivity study carried out on two faulted versions of the same full-field flow simulation model. Significant influence of some of these generally neglected fault-related assumptions and uncertainties is revealed.},

abstract = {Based on the wealth of data generated by the oil industry, the regional-scale characteristics of rocks, the flow of formation waters, and their relation to hydrocarbon accumulations were analyzed for the northern Alberta basin. The flow of formation waters in several aquifers and aquifer systems separated by intervening aquitards is at steady state and is driven by the present-day topography both on a regional and a local scale. The flow is generally from a recharge area in the southwest at the fold belt and Bovie Lake fault, to discharge in the northeast at the Great Slave Lake, the lowest point in the basin. The flow in Devonian aquifers is in open systems from recharge to discharge areas, whereas the flow in Carboniferous and Cretaceous aquifers is in semi-open systems, discharging into adjacent aquitards. Very high porosity and permeability in places in the Devonian Elk Point aquifer system are due to reefs, fracturing, dolomitization, and karst processes. Very high permeability probably leads to relatively high flow rates along the Presqu'ile barrier reef, resulting in local advective effects on the terrestrial heat transport to the surface. On a regional scale, all of the aquifers are underpressurized due to upstream propagation through high-permeability zones of low hydraulic heads at discharge elevations. The flow pattern is corroborated by salinity distributions, with comparatively lower salinity in each aquifer at recharge in the southwest and at discharge in the northeast caused by mixing with fresher meteoric water, and higher salinity between recharge and discharge areas. Salinity distributions show that the aquifers are not completely flushed of the original formation waters. Dissolution of salt and anhydrite from adjacent strata leads to high salinity in the Elk Point aquifer system and Beaverhill Lake aquifer. Hydrocarbons generated in the southwest in Devonian and Carboniferous strata, at maximum burial depth during the Laramide orogeny, migrated updip to the northeast driven by their own buoyancy and entrained by the flow of formation waters. Unless stratigraphically trapped by reefs and at the edge of semi-open aquifers, migration to the discharge areas led to loss of the volatile components and biodegradation into altered bitumens. The hydrostratigraphy and direction of the flow of formation waters in the northern part of the Alberta basin indicate that hydrocarbons generated in this region did not contribute to the formation of the giant Athabasca oil sand deposit located southeast of the study area.},

abstract = {This paper reports a new 1[degree sign] x 1[degree sign] global thermal model for the continental lithosphere (TC1). Geotherms for continental terranes of different ages (\textgreater 3.6 Ga to present) constrained by reliable data on borehole heat flow measurements (Artemieva, I.M., Mooney, W.D. 2001. Thermal structure and evolution of Precambrian lithosphere: a global study. J. Geophys. Res 106, 16387-16414.), are statistically analyzed as a function of age and are used to estimate lithospheric temperatures in continental regions with no or low-quality heat flow data (ca. 60% of the continents). These data are supplemented by cratonic geotherms based on electromagnetic and xenolith data; the latter indicate the existence of Archean cratons with two characteristic thicknesses, ca. 200 and \textgreater 250 km. A map of tectono-thermal ages of lithospheric terranes complied for the continents on a 1[degree sign] x 1[degree sign] grid and combined with the statistical age relationship of continental geotherms (z = 0.04 * t + 93.6, where z is lithospheric thermal thickness in km and t is age in Ma) formed the basis for a new global thermal model of the continental lithosphere (TC1). The TC1 model is presented by a set of maps, which show significant thermal heterogeneity within continental upper mantle, with the strongest lateral temperature variations (as large as 800 [degree sign]C) in the shallow mantle. A map of the depth to a 550 [degree sign]C isotherm (Curie isotherm for magnetite) in continental upper mantle is presented as a proxy to the thickness of the magnetic crust; the same map provides a rough estimate of elastic thickness of old (\textgreater 200 Ma) continental lithosphere, in which flexural rigidity is dominated by olivine rheology of the mantle. Statistical analysis of continental geotherms reveals that thick (\textgreater 250 km) lithosphere is restricted solely to young Archean terranes (3.0-2.6 Ga), while in old Archean cratons (3.6-3.0 Ga) lithospheric roots do not extend deeper than 200-220 km. It is proposed that the former were formed by tectonic stacking and underplating during paleocollision of continental nuclei; it is likely that such exceptionally thick lithospheric roots have a limited lateral extent and are restricted to paleoterrane boundaries. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the growth rate of the lithosphere since the Archean, which does not reveal a peak in lithospheric volume at 2.7-2.6 Ga as expected from growth curves for juvenile crust. A pronounced peak in the rate of lithospheric growth (10-18 km3/year) at 2.1-1.7 Ga (as compared to 5-8 km3/year in the Archean) well correlates with a peak in the growth of juvenile crust and with a consequent global extraction of massif-type anorthosites. It is proposed that large-scale variations in lithospheric thickness at cratonic margins and at paleoterrane boundaries controlled anorogenic magmatism. In particular, mid-Proterozoic anorogenic magmatism at the cratonic margins was caused by edge-driven convection triggered by a fast growth of the lithospheric mantle at 2.1-1.7 Ga. Belts of anorogenic magmatism within cratonic interiors can be caused by a deflection of mantle heat by a locally thickened lithosphere at paleosutures and, thus, can be surface manifestations of exceptionally thick lithospheric roots. The present volume of continental lithosphere as estimated from the new global map of lithospheric thermal thickness is 27.8 (+/- 7.0) x 109 km3 (excluding submerged terranes with continental crust); preserved continental crust comprises ca. 7.7 x 109 km3. About 50% of the present continental lithosphere existed by 1.8 Ga.},

abstract = {Geomechanical properties of sedimentary rocks, compaction behaviour and strength characteristics, in-situ stresses and fracturing mechanisms are important aspects when evaluating strategies for well drilling and reservoir production, stimulation and monitoring. The main objective of this paper is to point out that the effects of chemical compaction, diagenetic processes and cementation must be considered in addition to the mechanical processes governed by effective stresses. Shales and sandstones may become brittle at shallow depth when carbonate cemented and may remain only lightly quartz cemented to a burial depth of 2-3 km with a low shear strength. Fractures are then only open if the fluid over-pressure exceeds the horizontal stress, and the effective stresses driving compaction must then be small. During deeper burial, tectonic fractures will gradually be sealed with cement. Below 2-3 km depth, compaction is mainly chemical involving dissolution and precipitation of minerals. Rapid expulsion of pore water from mudstones is not possible due to the low permeability and slow mechanical and chemical compaction rates. The high confining stress during progressive burial makes open fractures unlikely at normal pressures, often resulting in over-pressures and hydro-fracturing. Open extensional fractures typically develop during uplifts and basin inversion when there is no fluid expulsion from compaction or petroleum generation. Tectonically induced lateral stress may also cause mechanical and chemical compaction thus reducing plate tectonic stress in sedimentary basins. Local gravitational stress and differential compaction may account for some of the stress anomalies observed in basins like the North Sea.},

The evaluation methods have traditionally used 1-D models, but progress in computing power has recently allowed us to achieve joint interpretations, including the large-scale effects of geological, topographical and hydrogeological features. This paper describes the steps taken in a recent integrated assessment and evaluation of the geothermal potential of the most populated areas of Switzerland. The methodology accounts for individual utilization scenarios and is based on temperature data that have been systematically collected over many years. The state-of-the-art compilation involves comprehensive 3-D regional geological and thermal models of 20-40 km extent. Zones of significant convective flow or preferential sites for borehole heat exchanger systems (BHE) can then be identified. In contrast to the results obtained from earlier geothermal resource assessments, the existing geological, hydrogeological and petrophysical data are included in the full 3-D numerical evaluation. The first results, referred to a well-documented subsurface area in Northern Switzerland, are now available. Analysis of temperature data have confirmed the importance of these factors.},

abstract = {Abstract  Processing of gravity and magnetic maps shows that the basement of the Upper Rhine Graben area is characterized by a series of NE–SW trending discontinuities and elongated structures, identified in outcrops in the Vosges, Black Forest, and the Odenwald Mountains. They form a 40 km wide, N30–40 striking, sinistral wrench-zone that, in the Visean, shifted the Variscan and pre-Variscan structures by at least 43 km to the NE. Wrenching was associated with emplacement of several generations of plutonic bodies emplaced in the time range 340–325 Ma. The sub-vertical, NE–SW trending discontinuities in the basement acted as zones of weakness, susceptible to reactivation by subsequent tectonism. The first reactivation, marked by mineralizations and palaeomagnetic overprinting along NE–SW faults of the Vosges Mountains, results from the Liassic NW–SE extension contemporaneous with the break-up of Pangea. The major reactivation occurred during the Late Eocene N–S compression and the Early-Middle Oligocene E–W extension. The NE–SW striking basement discontinuities were successively reactivated as sinistral strike-slip faults, and as oblique normal faults. Elongated depocenters appear to form in association with reactivated Variscan wrench faults. Some of the recent earthquakes are located on NE–SW striking Variscan fault zones, and show sinistral strike-slip focal mechanisms with the same direction, suggesting also present reactivation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Four Mesozoic-Cenozoic palaeothermal episodes related to deeper burial and subsequent exhumation and one reflecting climate change during the Eocene have been identified in a study of new apatite fission-track analysis (AFTAR) and vitrinite reflectance data in eight Danish wells. The study combined thermal-history reconstruction with exhumation studies based on palaeoburial data (sonic velocities) and stratigraphic and seismic data. Mid-Jurassic exhumation (ca. 175 Ma) was caused by regional doming of the North Sea area, broadly contemporaneous with deep exhumation in Scandinavia. A palaeogeothermal gradient of 45 oC km-1 at that time may be related to a mantle plume rising before rifting in the North Sea. Mid-Cretaceous exhumation affecting the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone is probably related to late Albian tectonic movements (ca. 100 Ma). The Sole Pit axis in the southern North Sea experienced similar inversion and this suggests a plate-scale response along crustal weakness zones across NW Europe. Mid-Cenozoic exhumation affected the eastern North Sea Basin and the onset of this event correlates with a latest Oligocene unconformity (ca. 24 Ma), which indicates a major Scandinavian uplift phase. The deeper burial that caused the late Oligocene thermal event recognized in the AFTA data reflect progradation of lower Oligocene wedges derived from the uplifting Scandinavian landmass. The onset of Scandinavian uplift is represented by an earliest Oligocene unconformity (ca. 33 Ma). Late Neogene exhumation affected the eastern (and western) North Sea Basin including Scandinavia. The sedimentation pattern in the central North Sea Basin shows that this phase began in the early Pliocene (ca. 4 Ma), in good agreement with the AFTA data. These three phases of Cenozoic uplift of Scandinavia also affected the NE Atlantic margin, whereas an intra-Miocene unconformity (ca. 15 Ma) on the NE Atlantic margin reflects tectonic movements of only minor amplitude in that area. The study demonstrates that only by considering episodic exhumation as an inherent aspect of the sedimentary record can the tectonic evolution be accurately reconstructed.},

abstract = {Sedimentary basin inversion, the shortening of formerly extensional basins, is accommodated mainly by compressional reactivation of extant faults and fractures across a wide range of scales. As such, inversion is a large-scale manifestation of Byerlee friction, the dynamic criterion for fault reactivation governing the effective shear strength of the shallow crust. Basin inversion generates distinctive deformational architecture, and it is implicated strongly in sedimentary basin exhumation. As a principal source of horizontal stress, inversion drives significant sedimentary porosity reduction and resultant fluid flow. Upper crustal deformation is critically dependent on fluid overpressure (i.e., pore fluid pressures greater than would be calculated from a hydrostatic gradient), and, perhaps more than in any other tectonic setting, overpressures are potentially large during sedimentary basin inversion. This review therefore includes discussion of the role of fluid overpressure in inversion and the evidence for it. Collectively, inversion has profound implications–good and bad–for the prospectivity of many petroliferous sedimentary basins. Thus, recognizing the evidence for basin inversion, quantifying its magnitude and understanding the mechanisms that accommodate inversion and other phenomena affected by it, have become essential components of the basin analyst's remit.},

The main border fault zones of the RVRS, the Peel Boundary and the Feldbiss Fault zones, have been active during the Quaternary and are still active today, as indicated by the occurrence of earthquakes. In this paper we present the results of a trench across the Feldbiss Fault, part of the Feldbiss Fault zone. This trench provided no evidence for earthquakes along this segment of the fault zone; fluidization structures were not encountered. A sudden increase in the average fault displacement rate was inferred for the period around 15 ka B P in a trench nearby, across the Geleen Fault of the same fault zone. The (limited) age control cannot exclude that such an acceleration also occurred at the Feldbiss Fault. During the second half of the 1990's several paleoseismological trenching studies have been carried out in the RVRS. The compilation of the results of these studies reveals that the main border faults possibly experienced an increase in fault activity around 10-15 ka B P. The timing of this increased activity and results from glacial rebound modelling indicate that glacial unloading of the crust can have triggered this increase in fault activity.},

abstract = {Differential stress exerts both static and dynamic effects on rock-mass permeability, modulating fluid flow in the Earth's crust. Static stress fields impose a permeability anisotropy from stress-controlled features such as faults, extension fractures, and stylolites which, depending on the tectonic regime, may enhance, or counteract existing anisotropic permeability in layered rock sequences. Textural evidence from hydrothermal veins suggests, however, that fluid flow in fault-related fracture systems generally occurs episodically and that dynamic stress cycling effects are widespread. In the vicinity of active faults that undergo intermittent rupturing, permeability and fluid flux may be tied to the earthquake cycle through a range of mechanisms, leading to complex interactions between stress cycling, the creation and destruction of permeability, and fluid flow. Mechanisms for fluid redistribution include: (1) various forms of dilatancy (localized to the fault zone or extending through the surrounding rock mass) related to changes in shear stress and/or mean stress that occur during the fault loading cycle; (2) localized post-seismic redistribution around rupture irregularities, especially dilational jogs and bends which act as suction pumps; and (3) post-seismic discharge of fluids from overpressured portions of the crust through fault-valve action when ruptures breach impermeable barriers. All of these processes may be involved in fluid redistribution around active faults, but they operate to varying extents at different crustal levels, and in different tectonic regimes.},

abstract = {Theoretical models of compaction and porosity modification in sandstones during burial are discussed. Theory predicts that mechanical compaction is the dominant porosity reducing mechanism during burial from 0 to 2.5-3 km. Porosity-depth trends are at this stage mainly controlled by the stability of the grain framework and the effective stress. Time and temperature also influence the porosity-depth gradients at shallow to moderate depths, but are probably less important than effective stress and framework grain composition. At greater burial depths, below 2.5-3 km, chemical compaction, including pressure solution, can explain most of the porosity reduction in well sorted clean arenites. Theoretical modelling of the intergranular pressure solution suggests that sandstones may lose porosity rapidly by this mechanism below 2.5-3 km and that factors capable of retarding pressure solution and quartz cementation are required to maintain prospective porosities below 4 km. This theory and comparisons with empirical data from Jurassic sandstones from offshore Norway indicate that high porosity is favoured by (1) overpressures approaching the lithostatic pressure gradient, (2) a short residence time below 3 km burial, (3) coatings on grains of clay or microcrystalline quartz which prevent quartz dissolution and precipitation and (4) a high content of feldspar and early diagenetic secondary pores. Early hydrocarbon emplacement may retard quartz cementation and preserve porosity, but chemical compaction probably continues after oil emplacement, except at very high hydrocarbon saturations.},

abstract = {The Moab fault, a basin-scale normal fault that juxtaposes Jurassic eolian sandstone units against Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous shale and sandstone, is locally associated with extensive calcite and lesser quartz cement. We mapped the distribution of fault-related diagenetic alteration products relative to the fault structure to identify sealing and conductive fault segments for fluid flow and to relate fault-fluid-flow behavior to the internal architecture of the fault zone. Calcite cement occurs as vein and breccia cement along slip surfaces and as discontinuous vein cement and concretions in fault damage zones. The cement predominates along fault segments that are composed of joints, sheared joints, and breccias that overprint earlier deformation bands. Using the distribution of fault-related calcite cement as an indicator of paleofluid migration, we infer that fault-parallel fluid flow was focused along fault segments that were overprinted by joints and sheared joints. Joint density, and thus fault-parallel permeability, is highest at locations of structural complexity such as fault intersections, extensional steps, and fault-segment terminations. The association of calcite with remnant hydrocarbons suggests that calcite precipitation was mediated by the degradation and microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons. We propose that the discontinuous occurrence of microbially mediated calcite cement may impede, but not completely seal, fault-parallel fluid flow. Fault-perpendicular flow, however, is mostly impeded by the juxtaposition of the sandstone units against shale and by shale entrainment. The Moab fault thus exemplifies the complex interaction of fault architecture and diagenetic sealing processes in controlling the hydraulic properties of faults in clastic sequences.},

abstract = {The heat flow map of Europe was derived from 2605 existing observations, which for this purpose were supplemented by numerous results of deep borehole temperatures, gradients and local heat flow patterns. In areas without data the heat flow field was extrapolated on the basis of the regional tectonic structure and the observed correlation of heat flow and the age of the last tectono-thermal event. The heat flow pattern as obtained in the map may be described by two components: (i) regional part and (ii) local part of the measured surface geothermal activity. The regional part of the heat flow field in Europe is dominated on the whole by a general ‘north-east to south-west' increase of the geothermal activity, which is an obvious consequence of the tectonic evolution, the major heat flow provinces corresponding thus to the principal tectonic units. The geothermal fine structure (local part) superimposing the former is mainly controlled by local tectonics, especially by the distribution of the deep reaching fracture zones and by the hydrogeological parameters. The correlation between the heat flow pattern and the crustal structure allows some preliminary geophysical implications: (a) areas of the increased seismicity may be connected with the zones of high horizontal temperature gradient, (b) increased surface heat flow may be generally observed in the zones of weakened crustal thickness, (c) there are considerable regional variations in the calculated temperature on the Moho-discontinuity, as well as in the upper mantle heat flow contribution.},

abstract = {We present stratigraphic modeling and quantitative analysis of the Pliocene and Quaternary subsidence of the southern North Sea basin. During the Late Pliocene, well before the onset of Quaternary glaciation, the subsidence rate in the southern part of the North Sea basin showed a ten-fold increase relative to previous Tertiary rates. The high Pliocene-Quaternary subsidence rate is consistent with the direction and state of the present intraplate stress field in Northwest Europe. One possible consequence of the modern compressional stress field in Northwest Europe is reactivation of faulting in the Central Graben resulting in localized stretching and the development of pull-apart basins. Alternatively, the acceleration in Late Pliocene subsidence rates could be due to localized flexural downwarping of the lithosphere in the Central Graben caused by an increase in the level of intraplate compression. Both mechanisms succesfully predict the major characteristics of the overall Quaternary subsidence history and stratigraphy. Gravity modeling suggests that the mechanism of localized stretching dominates the recent tectonostratigraphic evolution of the southern North Sea.},

abstract = {Temperature recordings from exploration boreholes for hydrocarbons and geothermal energy are evaluated to select the best-suitable data for determining formation temperature and heat flow in the Northeast German Basin. Repeated temperature logs measured in several boreholes allow a classification into equilibrium logs and perturbed logs. For the latter, a simple empirical correction is proposed based on mean annual ground-surface temperature, the estimated amount of temperature correction at total depth of log, and the depth-dependent cross-over point of temperature perturbation due to drilling. Analysis of bottom-hole temperatures (BHTs) showed that the uncorrected values deviate, on average, by as much as 22.2±10.2°C (1sigma) from the formation temperature. BHTs corrected using the Horner-plot method are systematically too low by 1–2°C compared to values corrected using the exact solution to the full line-source equation. Both correction methods yield values that underestimate formation temperatures by as much as 9°C and 8°C, respectively. The large standard deviation (1sigma) of about ±8°C indicates that a corrected BHT reflects (with 96% confidence, 2sigma) formation temperature not better than ±16°C. However, using temperature logs in conjunction with the corrected BHTs allowed a prediction of formation temperatures with an error less than ±10°C at somewhat deeper depths than the log in several boreholes. The availability of continuous temperature logs as a prerequisite for a reduction of error of BHTs significantly reduced the quantity of useable corrected BHTs in the basin.},

A "bulk" thermal diffusivity of the borehole-rock system of approximately 0.003 cm2/sec, initially suggested by Leblanc et al (1982), is confirmed by comparison with a two-media borehole model. In general, time-consecutive BHT measurements exhibit slower stabilization than those predicted by thermal conduction models. A simple model of thermal stabilization of a borehole with continued circulation after cessation of drilling is proposed. By modeling the thermal sink due to continued circulation of drilling mud as an exponentially decaying sink, thermal stabilization curves more consistent with observation are obtained. A good estimate of true formation temperature can be obtained by a curve-matching technique where the observed BHT data are well behaved and the physical conditions in the borehole closely match the assumed model. However, it is virtually impossible in some cases to obtain a precise estimate of true formation temperature with BHT measurements from well log runs with current BHT stabilization models.},

abstract = {The subsidence history of Australia's southern margin is shown to consist of two distinct tectonic phases and has important implications for models of sedimentary basin formation. The first phase is characterized by rapid tectonic subsidence (about 50 m/m.y.) which lasted for about 25-30 m.y. during the Early Cretaceous. The period of rapid subsidence represents the rifting phase of margin development. This early stage is correlated with associated rifting phenomena: faulting and extension of the brittle upper crust, formation of grabens and half-grabens, and the rapid accumulation of volcanogenic detritus (Otway Group). The amount of extension (20-50%) is estimated from a comparison of observed and modeled tectonic subsidence at several exploratory wells along the margin The model includes uniform extension and thinning of the continental lithosphere, a prolonged extensional event followed by simple cooling, horizontal and vertical conduction of heat, and radioactive heat production by the crust. The rift phase may have begun earlier, but the most rapid and widespread subsidence occurred during the Early Cretaceous. The end of rapid and widespread subsidence occurred during the Early Cretaceous. The end of rapid subsidence coincides closely with the age of the oldest sea floor spreading magnetic anomaly (about 90 Ma) adjacent to the continent-ocean boundary (COB). The second stage of margin development is the post-rift (or drift) phase, a period of much slower rates of subsidence and relative tectonic quiescence. Subsidence during the post-rift stage is modeled as cooling and contraction of extended continental lithosphere. Estimates of extension and thinning from subsidence modeling agree with seismic refraction measurements of the thickness of continental crust near the COB. Estimates of extension from the geometry of basement blocks near the COB do not agree with the analysis from subsidence modeling. Upper crustal extension seems to record only a small proportion of total lithospheric extension. Alternative or supplementary mechanisms of extension are explored, with emphasis on implications from a model that includes localized shear along a lithospheric detachment system.},

abstract = {The complex West Netherlands Basin contains oil and gas in Triassic and Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous clastic reservoir sequences. The understanding has always been that the Carboniferous coal measures have generated only gas and the Jurassic marine Posidonia Shale only oil. However, detailed geochemical analyses show that both source rocks have generated oil and gas. Geochemical fingerprinting established a correlation of the hydrocarbons with the main source rocks. The occurrence of these different hydrocarbons is consistent with migration routes. Map-based charge modeling shows that the main phase of hydrocarbon generation occurred prior to the Late Cretaceous inversion of the West Netherlands Basin. However, along the southwest flank of the basin and in lows between the inversion highs, significant charge continued during the Tertiary. Biodegradation of oils in Jurassic and Cretaceous reservoirs occurred during the earliest Tertiary, but only in reservoirs that were at that time at temperatures of less then 70 to 80[degrees]C, where bacteria could survive. This study shows that also in a mature hydrocarbon province an integrated hydrocarbon habitat study with modern analyses and state-of-the-art technology can lead to a much improved understanding of the distribution of oil and gas in the subsurface. The results of this study will allow a better risk assessment for remaining prospects, and an improved prediction of the type of trapped hydrocarbons in terms of gas, oil, and biodegraded oil.},

abstract = {Porosity and permeability generally decrease with increasing depth (thermal exposure and effective pressure); however, a significant number of deep (\textgreater4 km [approximately 13,000 ft]) sandstone reservoirs worldwide are characterized by anomalously high porosity and permeability. Anomalous porosity and permeability can be defined as being statistically higher than the porosity and permeability values occurring in typical sandstone reservoirs of a given lithology (composition and texture), age, and burial/temperature history. In sandstones containing anomalously high porosities, such porosities exceed the maximum porosity of the typical sandstone subpopulation. Major causes of anomalous porosity and permeability were identified decades ago; however, quantification of the effect of processes responsible for anomalous porosity and permeability and the assessment of the predictability of anomalous porosity and permeability occurrence in subsurface sandstones have rarely been addressed in published literature. The focus of this article is on quantification and predictability of three major causes of anomalously high porosity: (1) grain coats and grain rims, (2) early emplacement of hydrocarbons, and (3) shallow development of fluid overpressure. Grain coats and grain rims retard quartz cementation and concomitant porosity and permeability reduction by inhibiting precipitation of quartz overgrowths on detrital-quartz grains. Currently, prediction of anomalous porosity associated with grain coats and grain rims is dependent on the availability of empirical data sets. In the absence of adequate empirical data, sedimentologic and diagenetic models can be helpful in assessing risk due to reservoir quality. Such models provide a means to evaluate the effect of geologic constraints on coating occurrence and coating completeness required to preserve economically viable porosity and permeability in a given play or prospect. These constraints include thermal history and sandstone grain size and composition. The overall effect of hydrocarbon emplacement on reservoir quality is controversial. It appears that at least some cements (quartz and illite) may continue to precipitate following emplacement of hydrocarbons into the reservoir. Our work indicates that integration of basin modeling with reservoir quality modeling can be used to quantify, prior to drilling, the potential impact of hydrocarbon emplacement on porosity and permeability. The best-case scenario for significant reservoir quality preservation due to fluid overpressure development is in rapidly deposited Tertiary or Quaternary sandstones. Our models suggest that significant porosity can be preserved in sandstones that have experienced continuous high fluid overpressures from shallow burial depths. The models also indicate that the potential for porosity preservation is greatest in ductile-grain-rich sandstones because compaction tends to be the dominant control on reservoir quality in such rocks. The case for significant porosity preservation associated with fluid overpressures in pre-Tertiary basins, however, is more problematic because of the complexities in the history of fluid overpressure and the greater significance of quartz cementation as a potential mechanism of porosity loss.},

The seismic data penetrate down to 900 m in the sedimentary cover or to the Paleozoic basement. The reflection response of the acoustic basement provides clear indications with regard to the top of the Paleozoic: crystalline basement and Lower Paleozoic metasediments and volcanics of the London-Brabant Massif and NE-dipping Devonian and Carboniferous strata. The subhorizontal Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary cover comprises 20 unconformity-bound seismic units: 5 in the Cretaceous and 15 in the Cenozoic. Based on borehole information, these units are correlated with lithostratigraphically defined formations or groups. Some of the unit-bounding unconformities are of regional importance. They are attributed i) to eustatic sea-level changes causing regional flooding during the Late Cretaceous or incision of deep valleys during the Late Oligocene and Late Miocene, ii) to regional tectonic tilting between Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, or iii) to a combination of eustasy and tectonics causing valley incisions during the Lutetian. Faults of the Roer Valley Graben have offset different stratigraphic levels by sometimes considerable amounts (up to 230 m in the Oligocene to Quaternary succession). Although the main tectonic phase took place during the Miocene, the activity has varied considerably through time, and also from fault to fault. Most faults seem to have a 10 to 30-m displacement since the Late Pliocene.},

abstract = {Coupling between deformation processes and rock permeability is a major factor influencing fluid migration and fluid-rock interaction during the formation of mesothermal lode gold systems in mid- to upper crustal regimes. The evolution of permeability during deformation is controlled by a dynamic competition between deformation-induced porosity creation processes and porosity destruction processes. Localization of deformation in faults and shear zones leads to flow localization, with large scale flow systems forming when active faults and shear zones link to create percolation networks. Broad regions of fluid focusing develop around the upstream segments of active shear networks and fluid discharge regions develop in the downstream parts of these systems.  The architecture of flow within shear networks is influenced by the relative proportions of backbone, dangling and isolated structures within the network. Connectivity in the network may increase with growth of the shear network, but is expected to continually change as the locus and intensity of deformation changes. The typical distribution of mesothermal lode deposits within crustal scale shear networks indicates that mesothermal systems might develop most efficiently in networks that are close to the percolation threshold, i.e. with most flow occurring along a flow backbone forming only a small part of the total shear network. Dangling elements adjacent to the backbone, particularly in the downstream (discharge) parts of the system, provide some of the best potential for gold deposition by fluid-rock interaction processes.  Contrasting styles of fluid flow are expected between the seismogenic and aseismic regimes of the shear- or fault-hosted hydrothermal systems associated with mesothermal lode gold formation. Below the seismic-aseismic transition, creep processes can lead to near-steady state permeabilities and produce continuous fluid flow regimes. In the seismogenic regime, large cyclic changes in fault permeability, fluid pressures and fluid flux occur during the seismic cycle, and lead to fault-valve behaviour and episodic fluid flow. The seismogenic regime allows for a richer variety of gold deposition processes than is generally available in the aseismic regions of hydrothermal systems associated with lode gold formation.},

abstract = {The new tomographic image of the mantle beneath the French Massif Central reaching a depth of 270 km is interpreted in terms of mantle temperature, considering effects of anharmonicity and anelasticity on seismic velocities as well as effects of mineral reactions, composition and partial melt. For every block of the tomographic model we calculate the absolute temperature required to fit the observed velocity perturbation, the average temperature of the tomographic layer being constrained by P-T estimates from mantle xenoliths and by surface heat flow. From the 3-D temperature distribution we estimate the topography of the thermal lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as well as 3-D distributions of density, absolute P- and S-velocities and seismic attenuation. The observed velocity perturbations in the mantle beneath the Massif Central can be explained nearly entirely by temperature variations. Temperatures approach the dry peridotite solidus in the depth range from 50 to 90 km just below Cenozoic volcanic areas, but no large-scale partial melting is required to fit the seismic observations. Model temperatures agree well with P-T estimates from mantle xenoliths and measured surface heat flow. Model-predicted seismic velocities, seismic attenuation and density fit well the observations from seismic refractions, surface waves and gravity. The model predicts a broad uplift of the thermal lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to a depth of 65-70 km with a 50-70 km wide band of stronger lithospheric thinning which crosses the main volcanic fields and strikes parallel to the direction of maximal compression in the crust. The Limagne Graben, which is the major rift structure of the Massif Central, has no clear expression in the topography of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Our interpretation suggests a mantle plume below the central and southern part of the Massif Central with a potential temperature which is about 150-200[degree sign]C higher than the average potential temperature of the upper mantle. The structure of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary provides evidence for a possible thinning of the mantle part of the lithosphere beneath the volcanic fields parallel to the direction of minimal horizontal compression in the crust.},

abstract = {Altogether 98 focal mechanisms of micro to moderate earthquakes (ML = 0.5-5.9) have been used to analyze the state of stress in the Rhine Graben and adjacent areas. Due to dense networks in the investigated area fault plane solutions determined by the first motion method can be fixed with an accuracy better than 10[degree sign]. The majority of the focal mechanisms is characterized by strike-slip and normal faulting movements; only a few events are of reverse faulting type. To calculate the orientations of the principal stress axes and the shape of the stress tensor we applied the inversion method of Gephart and Forsyth (1984) to three subsets of the data, each of which has been chosen taking into account the local tectonic units (northern Alpine foreland, southern Rhine Graben, northern Rhine Graben including Rhenish Massif and lower Rhine Embayment). For all of the data subsets, the inversions revealed a stable axis of minimum principal stress [sigma]3, oriented horizontally to subhorizontally and striking in a WSW-ENE to SW-NE direction. The azimuth of [sigma]1, the maximum principal stress, is about 150[degree sign]. However, the confidence regions show that horizontal and vertical orientations of [sigma]1, as well as orientations in between, are of the same probability. Therefore, an unequivocal distinction between strike-slip and extensional regimes is not possible. When comparing the results from the data subsets, a slight counterclockwise rotation from south to north of about 30[degree sign] of the [sigma]1-[sigma]2 plane plane as well as of the direction of [sigma]3, can be observed. The relative stress magnitude R (R = ([sigma]2 - [sigma]1)/([sigma]3 - [sigma]1)) has a value of about 0.5 for all subsets, indicating that for the deviatoric part of the stress tensor, [sigma]1 and [sigma]3 are of the same magnitude but of opposite sign. The directions of the horizontal stresses, SHmax and Shmin, inferred from the analysis of focal mechanisms are in good agreement with the general features for western Europe in the European Stress Map. More detailed investigations have been performed for the southern Rhine Graben area. A division into an upper crustal (\textless15 km) and a lower crustal (\textgreater15 km) dataset makes possible the resolution of an individual stress regime for each subset: a strike-slip regime for the upper and an extensional regime for the lower crust, with the same azimuths of the principal stress axes for both depth ranges. Such a change of the stress tensor with depth fits into the tectonic model of detachment zones in the lower crust in the northern front of the Alps, a detachment caused by south-plunging subduction of the European plate beneath the Alps and the Adriatic plate. On the basis of the resolved orientations of the principal stress axes and the shape of the stress tensor, we furthermore estimated absolute stress magnitudes and the ranges of frictional parameters acting on the individual faults. Assuming hydrostatic pore pressure on the faults, frictional coefficients between 0.10 and 0.64 are required to enable slip. On the other hand, when the frictional coefficient has been fixed to 0.65, the required pore pressure values range from 0.38 to 0.62 of lithostatic with an average of 0.48. The absolute stress magnitudes inferred from the analysis of the focal mechanisms compare favourably with the in-situ measurements of absolute stresses from the KTB borehole at Windischeschenbach (German continental deep drilling program).},

abstract = {Rocks that crop out across southern Britain were exhumed from depths of as much as 2.5 km during Cenozoic time. This has been widely attributed to Paleocene regional uplift resulting from igneous underplating related to the Iceland mantle plume. Our compilation of paleothermal and compaction data reveals spatial and temporal patterns of exhumation showing little correspondence with the postulated influence of underplating, instead being dominated by kilometer-scale variations across Cenozoic compressional structures, which in several basins are demonstrably of Neogene age. We propose that crustal compression, due to plate boundary forces transmitted into the plate interior, was the major cause of Cenozoic uplift in southern Britain, witnessing a high strength crust in western Europe.},

abstract = {The properties of sandstones as potential reservoirs and shales as source rocks depend on primary facies relationships and diagenesis. Porostiy loss due to mechanical compation and pressure solution is essentially a function of grain parameters (sorting, packing and composition) and net overburden stress. The porosity loss can be predicted to a certain extent. The importance of secondary porosity caused by dissolution of framework grains and cements has been fully recognized. The discussion has focused on the processes causing such dissolution and to what extent it can cause net increase in porosity. The most critical factor in clastic diagenesis is the nature of porewater flow and the degree of mass transfer taking place as a result of this. In the North Sea reservoir rocks, petrographic and geochemical evidence suggest that most of the leaching of feldspar and mica resulting in the formation of kaolinite occurred early during fresh wather flushing. Recent calculations indicate that »acids« derived from source rocks are inadequate to explain the secondary porosity observed in reservoir rocks. Mathematical modelling suggests that thermal convection is of limited importance in sedimentary basins, except where there are high lateral changes in geothermal gradients. Evidence from porewater geochemistry suggests that porewaters in sedimentary basins are often stratified or compartmentalized in a way which is inconsistent with large scale convection or compactional flow, making it necessary to assume that diagenetic reactions are relatively isochemical during deeper burial. A better understanding of the diagenetic reactions will help us to improve our predictions about porosity/depth relations, pore size, and pore geometry distribution in reservoir rocks. Porosity depth trends from offshore Norway and published data from other basins are discussed. Empirical linear best fit lines are found to illustrate the relationship quite well for depths between one and five km. Within a specific region, the linear porosity gradient is a function of mineral composition and of temperature and pressure gradients. Primary porosity tends to be best preserved in sandstones with high proportions of stable grains (e. g. in quartz arenites) down to about 3 or 4 km. At greater depth, porosity loss is accelerated due to increased pressure solution. Secondary and primary porosity adjacent to feldspar grains then tends to be selectively preserved relative to primary pores between quartz grains.},

abstract = {A well-established event of intraplate basin inversion and basement thrusting affected central Europe in Late Cretaceous time. It is widely accepted to have resulted from the collision of the Alpine orogen with Europe's margin. At that time an early Alpine orogen, located on the leading edge of the Adria microplate, still lay far southeast of its present-day position and had entered a phase of extension after a first orogenic event characterized by W- to NW-directed thrusting. This configuration is not likely to have induced SSW-NNE-directed thrusting and folding in the future European foreland that was still separated from the Alpine wedge by a strip of oceanic lithosphere. By contrast, the onset of intraplate contraction coincides with an important change in relative motion between the European and African plates. At ca. 90 Ma, Africa's SSE-directed sinistral transform motion relative to Europe changed to NE-directed convergence. This agrees well with the timing and kinematics of intraplate thrusting in central Europe. Structures of similar age and kinematics occurring in southern France, Spain, and North Africa suggest that the Late Cretaceous pulse of contraction was caused by pinching west-central Europe's thin lithosphere between Baltica and Africa. Only since the onset of N-directed thrusting in the Alps in Paleocene or Eocene time are the kinematics of the Alps and their European foreland compatible, indicating that mechanical coupling between Africa-Europe and the Adria microplate had been achieved.},

abstract = {Abstract  We studied veins in the Triassic Buntsandstein of the Lower Saxony Basin (NW Germany) with the aim of quantifying the evolution of in-situ stress, fluids and material transport. Different generations of veins are observed. The first generation formed in weakly consolidated rocks without a significant increase in fracture permeability and was filled syntectonically with fibrous calcite and blocky to elongate-blocky quartz. The stable isotopic signature ($\delta$18O and $\delta$13C) indicates that the calcite veins precipitated from connate water at temperatures of 55–122°C. The second vein generation was syntectonically filled with blocky anhydrite, which grew in open fractures. Fluid inclusions indicate that the anhydrite veins precipitated at a minimum temperature of 150°C from hypersaline brines. Based on $\delta$34S measurements, the source of the sulphate was found in the underlying Zechstein evaporites. The macro- and microstructures indicate that all veins were formed during subsidence and that the anhydrite veins were formed under conditions of overpressure, generated by inflation rather than non-equilibrium compaction. The large amount of fluids which are formed by the dehydrating gypsum in the underlying Zechstein and are released into the Buntsandstein during progressive burial form a likely source of overpressures and the anhydrite forming fluids.},

Deep temperature distributions within the crust-lithosphere are calculated for 1-D, 2-D and simple 3-D models. Characteristic temperature-depth curves are given for some of the major tectonic provinces, and the results of various techniques are compared. The value of the crustal heat contribution is assessed and a regional Moho heat flow pattern is proposed.

The study concentrates on a quantitative evaluation of the processes controlling late-orogenic extension and destruction of the Variscides, particularly the gravitational instability of thickened crust. Modelling results suggest that gravitational forces along cannot reproduce the observed timing and amount of Permo-Carboniferous crustal thinning. Tensile plate-boundary forces are required in addition to gravitation to restore a crustal thickness of approximately 30rkm in the Variscan Internides. Stresses as little as 10rMPa result in up to 28% extension and a good fit between observed data and model predictions. It is concluded that the Stephanian to Rotliegend evolution in the vicinity of the modelled traverse resulted not from gravitational forces inherited from Variscan crustal thickening, but was related to a change in orientation of the plate-boundary stresses at the end of the Westphalian.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 942013113 The petroleum industry uses subsurface flow models for two principal purposes: to model the flow of hydrocarbons into traps over geological time, and to simulate the production of hydrocarbon from reservoirs over periods of decades or less. Faults, which are three-dimensional volumes, are approximated in both modelling applications as planar membranes onto which predictions of the most important fault-related flow properties are mapped. Faults in porous clastic reservoirs are generally baffles or barriers to flow and the relevant flow properties are therefore very different to those which are important in conductive fracture flow systems. A critical review and discussion is offered on the work-flows used to predict and model capillary threshold pressure for exploration fault seal analysis and fault transmissibility multipliers for production simulation, and of the data from which the predictions derive. New flow simulation models confirm that failure of intra-reservoir sealing faults can occur during a reservoir depressurization via a water-drive mechanism, but contrary to anecdotal reports, published examples of production-induced seal failure are elusive. Ignoring the three-dimensional structure of fault zones can sometimes have a significant influence on production-related flow, and a series of models illustrating flow associated with relay zones are discussed.},

Uplift of the area south of the Feldbiss Fault Zone forced the Meuse River to incise and, as a result, a flight of terraces was formed. Faults of the Feldbiss Fault Zone have displaced the Middle and Late Pleistocene terrace deposits. In this study, an extensive geomorphological survey was carried out to locate the faults of the Feldbiss Fault Zone and to determine the displacement history of terrace deposits. The Feldbiss Fault Zone is characterized by an average displacement rate of 0.041-0.047 mm a-1 during the Late Pleistocene. Individual faults show an average displacement rate ranging between 0.010 and 0.034 mm a-1. The spatial variation in displacement rates along the individual faults reveals a system of overstepping faults. These normal faults developed by reactivation of Paleozoic strike-slip faults. As fault displacements at the bases of the younger terrace deposits are apparently similar to the tops of the adjacent older terrace, the age of these horizons is the same within thousands of years. This implies that the model of terrace development by rapid fluvial incision followed by slow aggradation does apply for this area.},

These facies models are better suited to treating issues of rock strata connectivity, e.g. buried high permeability channels or low permeability barriers, which greatly affect flow and, above all, transport in aquifers. Genetic models provide new ways to incorporate more geology into the facies description, an approach that has been well developed in the oil industry, but not enough in hydrogeology. The conclusion is that future work should be focused on improving the facies models, comparing them, and designing new in situ testing procedures (including geophysics) that would help identify the facies geometry and properties.

abstract = {We propose that zones of transient high permeability around ancient fault systems can be predicted if fault segments and likely locations for paleo-rupture arrest are identified. Lode gold deposits in the Kalgoorlie terrane, Western Australia, are the products of focused fluid flow through faulted crust. Deposits in the Mount Pleasant area are clustered on small-displacement structures over ∼10 km of the >50-km-long Black Flag fault. Field relationships and net slip distribution along the fault indicate that the deposits are adjacent to, but not within, a kilometer-scale dilatant jog, where two segments of the fault are linked. On this basis we infer that the dilatant jog was a long-term rupture-arrest site. The observations are compatible with rupture on segments of the Black Flag fault changing stress in the surrounding crust and bringing specific zones closer to failure. By analogy with active seismogenic fault systems, those zones correspond to regions where aftershocks occur preferentially after failure. Stress-transfer modeling of the system helps explain the location of mineralized small- displacement structures around the Black Flag fault and indicates that gold deposits in the area are located on structures that became transiently permeable and localized fluid flow during repeated aftershock ruptures. Thus, localized through-flow, or mixing of fluids within fault systems, is likely to be controlled by the distribution of aftershocks following rupture events; this distribution is predictable.},

abstract = {Chalk is the most characteristic facies type of the Upper Cretaceous in Belgium and the only Cretaceous rock type found on the central and northern parts of the Brabant Massif. Marine Cretaceous deposits gradually encroached the Brabant Massif from the south during transgressive pulses starting in the Cenomanian – Turonian, displaying chalk facies from the Coniacian onwards. The chalk cover on the northern part of the Brabant Massif and in the Campine basin was not installed until the late Santonian and Campanian, while inversion of the Rur Valley Graben prevented any sedimentation. The base of the chalk deposit is diachronic and may be laterally equivalent to more detrital, continental-marine facies. Flooding was gentle, covering a peneplanated landscape, while partly preserving the saprolitic paleosol and thus not influencing the chalky nature of the sediment. Peneplanation did not erase all irregularities in paleotopography, leading to differences in timing of the onset of marine sedimentation, in accommodation space and sediment thickness across the axis of the Brabant Massif. Subsequent uplift of the Brabant Massif relative to the Campine Basin led to progressive disappearance of the Maastrichtian and erosion cutting into the chalk in a southern direction. South of the axis of culmination of the Brabant Massif, in the southern half of West-Flanders, the chalk forms the latest Cretaceous formation, partially preserved. North of the axis of culmination, in the northern part of West- and East-Flanders and the westernmost part of the province of Antwerp, the chalk forms the earliest Cretaceous formation, equivalent to the more detritic sediments of the Campine basin which were supplied by the inverted Roer Valley Graben. In contrast to the Mons sedimentary-tectonic basin to the south, where the standard lithostratigraphical scale of the Belgian Cretaceous has been established, the Coniacian to Campanian chalk deposits on the Brabant Massif cannot be differentiated lithologically. A formal lithostratigraphic unit, the Nevele Formation, is introduced comprising all chalk deposits on the Brabant Massif.},

This stage is associated with block faulting and subsidence. The lithosphere then thickens by heat conduction to the surface, and further slow subsidence occurs which is not associated with faulting. The slow subsidence and the heat flow depend only on the amount of stretching, which can be estimated from these quantities and from the change in thickness of the continental crust caused by the extension. The model is therefore easily tested.

abstract = {The calibration of a groundwater model with the aid of hydrochemical data has demonstrated that low recharge rates in the Middle Rio Grande Basin may be responsible for a groundwater trough in the center of the basin and for a substantial amount of Rio Grande water in the regional flow system. Earlier models of the basin had difficulty reproducing these features without any hydrochemical data to constrain the rates and distribution of recharge. The objective of this study was to use the large quantity of available hydrochemical data to help calibrate the model parameters, including the recharge rates. The model was constructed using the US Geological Survey's software MODFLOW, MODPATH, and UCODE, and calibrated using 14C activities and the positions of certain flow zones defined by the hydrochemical data. Parameter estimation was performed using a combination of nonlinear regression techniques and a manual search for the minimum difference between field and simulated observations. The calibrated recharge values were substantially smaller than those used in previous models. Results from a 30,000-year transient simulation suggest that recharge was at a maximum about 20,000 years ago and at a minimum about 10,000 years ago.},

abstract = {Faults may be barriers or conduits for fluid flow in sedimentary basins. The properties of faults, however, depend on stress conditions and rock properties at the time of deformation and subsequent diagenesis of the fault zone. Several recent publications have suggested that petroleum reservoirs in the North Sea and at Haltenbanken, offshore mid-Norway, have experienced leakage along faults caused by imposed stresses, related to glacial loading during the Quaternary. The Jurassic reservoirs in these areas are, however, bounded by faults produced during the Upper Jurassic rifting, when the sediments were still soft and, for the most part, uncemented. These faults do not represent zones of weakness. Because of strain hardening and later diagenesis in sandstones and cementation in mudstones, the fault zones are commonly stronger than the adjacent rocks. They are therefore not likely to be reactivated tectonically. Furthermore, there is little evidence of glacial deformation in the Quaternary sediments overlying these oil fields. It has been proposed that very large horizontal stresses, inferred to be related to periods of glacial loading, caused shear failure at pore pressures below fracture pressure and subsequent leakage along these shear zones. We argue that this is not a likely mechanism during progressive burial in sedimentary basins. Very high horizontal effective stresses, up to 60 MPa, at about 3 km (1.8 mi) depth, at Haltenbanken would have caused more mechanical compaction and grain crushing than that observed in situ. External stress, i.e., plate-tectonic stress from spreading ridges (ridge push), will be transmitted primarily through the basement and not through the much more compressible overlying sedimentary rocks. During progressive basin subsidence, chemical compaction, i.e., caused by quartz cementation, causes rock shrinkage, which will relax differential stresses. This makes brittle deformation (shear failure), resulting in open fractures less likely to occur at stresses below the fracture pressure. In subsiding sedimentary basins with progressive compaction, horizontal stress will normally not exceed the vertical stress except when there is significant shortening of the underlying basement.},

abstract = {Summary. The thermal and mechanical behaviour of the lithosphere during rifting is investigated using a two layer model for its rheology and different driving forces for the rift process. The uppermost crustal layer is assumed to deform by brittle failure, while the lower lithosphere, including the lower crust, is assumed to behave as a Newtonian viscous fluid. Results of numerical modelling of the deformation, flow and heat transport in the viscous layer are presented, in which viscosity is a strong function of depth (and temperature). Deformation of the upper brittle layer is complex and difficult to quantify. Thus deformation of this upper layer was approximated by a simple kinematic model in which the layer is thinned by an amount proportional to the amount of extension it experiences. Two fundamentally different driving forces were investigated. They correspond to active rifting, in which the litho-sphere is thinned by an upwelling limb of a convection cell or mantle plume, and to passive rifting, or stretching of the lithosphere. The results show that for zones of stretching which are wider than the thickness of the viscous layer, thinning at all levels in the lithosphere can be described by a single parameter, beta, as in earlier stretching models. This is not always true when the rift zone is narrow, or near the edges of the rift zone. Initial subsidence due to isostatic and thermal changes during stretching slows as stretching progresses, giving an exponential character to the rift stage subsidence. Active rifting is associated with thermal uplift. In this case lithospheric deformation is confined to a narrow zone near the base of the lithosphere, and thinning of the crust does not occur until the base of the lithosphere approaches that level. The rate of lithospheric thinning and width of the rift zone depend on the convection velocities in the underlying asthenosphere and on the viscosity-depth gradient near the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Also contributing to the elevation changes during rifting are dynamic stresses which result from the flow. These dynamic affects may significantly modify the uplift or subsidence of the rift zone. Another important process which results from viscous flow is the generation of secondary convection in the upwelling asthenosphere. Ths will further thin the lithosphere and can cause depth-dependent stretching, in which the lower lithosphere is thinned more than the upper lithosphere. Both of these properties of the flow; dynamic stresses and secondary convection, critically depend on absolute values of viscosity and so are not well constrained at present. The model results presented here exhibit the degree of complexity which results from viscous flow in the lower lithosphere and which is matched by the wide variety of observations on rifting.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track (AFT) analyses were performed on 13 Late Palaeozoic samples in order to unravel the late- to post-Variscan evolution of the Ardennes. The dated AFT ages cover a range from 290{+/-}33 Ma to 168{+/-}12 Ma, and the mean confined track lengths correspond to a unimodal distribution, with means varying between 13.1{+/-}0.1 {micro}m and 11.7{+/-}0.3 {micro}m. These ages for the sedimentary rocks are clearly younger than the respective stratigraphic ages, indicative of a cooling through the apatite partial annealing zone after post-depositional complete annealing. All available AFT data (290-146 Ma) from this region might be classified as three groups, that is 290-229 Ma, 218-198 Ma and 190-146 Ma, at least in correlation with three exhumation events. Using an inverse model, four major cooling episodes are identified from the modelled temperature-time (T-t) paths. The first rapid cooling (4.2-5.4 {degrees}C Ma-1, 320-300 Ma) corresponds to the late-Variscan rapid thrusting that ceased at about 300 Ma. The second cooling episode (0.2-4.0 {degrees}C Ma-1, up to 230 Ma) activated differentially, and was probably controlled by the post-Variscan transtension. The third cooling regime (0.1-0.3 {degrees}C Ma-1, 230-45 Ma) in the Ardennes Allochthon is slow, and represents a long-term and slow exhumation. In the Brabant Parautochthon, however, it is subdivided into 0.7 {degrees}C Ma-1 (225-110 Ma) and 0.2 {degrees}C Ma-1 (110-45 Ma). The last accelerated cooling (0.7-1.1 {degrees}C Ma-1, since 45 Ma) that affected the whole Ardennes is associated with a south-north compression during the Pyrenean phase.},

The initial high-resolution tomography down to a depth of 250 km did not image any columnar low-velocity anomaly which could be interpreted as a mantle plume anticipated beneath the Eger Rift, similar to recent findings of small plumes beneath the French Massif Central and the Eifel in Germany. Alternatively, we interpret the broad low-velocity anomaly beneath the Eger Rift by an upwelling of the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition. We also map lateral variations of seismic anisotropy of the mantle lithosphere from spatial variations of P-wave delay times and the shear wave splitting. Three major domains characterised by different orientations of seismic anisotropy correspond to the major tectonic units-Saxothuringian, Moldanubian and the Tepla-Barrandian-and their fabrics fit to those found in our previous studies of mantle anisotropy on large European scales.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity accounts for several paradoxes in groundwater flow and solute transport. One of the most striking observations is the emergence of scale effects in transmissivity, that is, the increase in effective transmissivity (or hydraulic conductivity, for that matter) with increasing scale of observation. Traditional stochastic approaches, where transmissivity is treated as a multilog-normal random function, lead to a large-scale effective transmissivity equal to the geometric average of local measurements. We present several field cases in which large-scale transmissivities are indeed larger than the geometric average of local tests. This suggests that the assumption of multilog-normality may not be valid in many cases, even if point T values display a log-normal distribution. We conjecture that scale dependence of T may, in part, be a consequence of high T zones being better connected than average or low T zones, a feature which may occur in many geological environments, but which is not consistent with multinormal log-T fields. We go on to generate a suite of log-T fields with a normal distribution for point values but non-multinormal spatial correlation. In all our fields, high T zones show longer correlations than average of low T zones. By simulating flow through these synthetic fields under simple boundary conditions, and estimating their effective transmissivity values, we conclude that these types of departures from the multilog-normality assumption lead consistently to scale effects.},

Although some regional effects occur, the European Cenozoic continental climate record correlates well with the global oxygen isotope record from marine environments. During the last 45 million years, continental cooling is especially pronounced for inferred winter temperatures but hardly observable from summer temperatures. Correspondingly, Cenozoic cooling in Central Europe is directly associated with an increase of seasonality. In contrast, inferred Cenozoic mean annual precipitation remained relatively stable, indicating the importance of latent heat transport throughout the Cenozoic. Moreover, our data support the concept that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, although linked to climate changes, were not the major driving force of Cenozoic cooling.},

abstract = {The West Netherlands Basin (WNB) and the neighbouring Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) form the most prominent tectonic features of the onshore Netherlands. The two basins have a common tectonic origin and similar Mesozoic evolution, their Neogene-Quaternary evolution, however, is markedly different. While the WNB is tectonically/seismically inactive and is characterised by uniform Neogene-Quaternary subsidence, in the RVRS fault controlled intra-plate deformation has taken place since Late Oligocene times with pronounced seismic activity. Considering the present-day NE-SW regional extension as well as the similar basin orientation and Mesozoic evolutions one would not expect strikingly different neotectonic activity in the two basins. Detailed analysis of Mesozoic, Tertiary and Quaternary fault patterns revealed that (1) the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic tectonic fabric has great influence on the Cenozoic deformation style of the basin system; (2) present-day faulting in the RVRS is related to the reactivation of pre-existing faults and (3) the Mesozoic fault pattern is slightly different in the two basins. Using a novel technique (three-dimensional (3-D) slip tendency analysis) we aim to determine whether these differences in fault orientation are substantial enough to produce significantly different resolved stresses along the faults. This modelling not only tests a common geological phenomena but indirectly also delivers important constraints regarding the origin of faulting in the study area. During the analysis 3-D geometric models of 84 mapped faults were investigated. The results of this recently developed modelling technique reveal that the faults in both basins should behave similarly under the condition of a laterally homogeneous regional stress field, which is in disagreement with the present-day tectonic activity of the region. On the other hand the modelling also reveals that the predicted tendency of slip is very sensitive to the ratio of the minimum horizontal and the vertical stress (S). As an explanation for the pronounced fault activity in the RVRS and the tectonic quietness of the WNB it is proposed that either the regional extension in the WNB is "weaker" (in term of higher S ratio) than that in the RVRS or the slip thresholds in the two basins are different. The study emphasised that differentiation in the tectonic evolution has already started in the Tertiary, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the different tectonic stress field and/or slip threshold between the two areas is directly related to the origin of the Cenozoic rifting in the RVRS. Several hypotheses are discussed to account for these two possibilities, taking into account the lithospheric structure and the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the two basins as well as surrounding areas.},

abstract = {Integration of vitrinite reflectance (Ro) and apatite fission track (AFT) data from well sequences can provide a direct estimate of the geothermal gradient at the time of maximum palaeotemperatures and the time at which sequences began to cool from maximum palaeotemperatures. These values, plus an understanding of the effects of cooling in response to long-term climatic changes, are particularly important when estimating the amount of denudation experienced by the sequences during cooling from maximum palaeotemperatures. In this case study, AFT data have been generated for subsurface samples from eight wells drilled within the North Slope foreland basin of northern Alaska in an effort to study the thermal history of the basin. The combination of Ro and AFT data establish that maximum palaeotemperatures were attained within the North Slope foreland basin prior to cooling beginning in the Palaeocene. Furthermore, they indicate that palaeogeothermal gradients when cooling began were close to the present-day values, and that Cenozoic surface cooling resulted in a significant amount of ‘apparent' denudation. These results suggest that heating throughout the basin was largely due to deeper burial, and that cooling was due to both removal of section by denudation and a drop in the mean annual surface temperature.},

abstract = {Detailed investigations of the temperature distribution in the Rhine Graben indicate a regular pattern of graben-parallel thermal anomalies following major north-south striking faults. These faults, which might imply north-south convection pattern due to higher permeability, have been ignored in conventional models based on 2D east-west striking sections. The present study investigates small-scale temperature anomalies in the Rhine Graben, focusing on its north-south striking major faults and their important permeability structures. Analytical solutions for convective flow in vertical faults were applied to a clearly observable anomalous temperature pattern. Through these calculations the fault geometry, minimal fault permeability and time to convective onset were derived from observed distances between anomalies. Since analytical solutions are limited to simple model geometries, further improvement was achieved through numerical model simulations, which allow the assumption of more complex initial and boundary conditions. Using the finite volume code TOUGH2 we investigated in detail the convective fluid flow pattern along the [Gamma]-fault in the Landau region through a 3D model. There, regions of alternatively higher and lower temperatures follow each other at an average distance of 1800 m. Focusing on the predominant north-south permeability structure, our model consists of a vertical north-south striking fault and surrounding matrix with fault geometries based on analytical predictions. The observed temperature could be explained by a numerical model indicating fluid velocities in the fault of 10-9 m s-1 and an anomaly whose minimal age is 77,000 years. The study proves that the observed small-scale graben-parallel temperature anomalies can be explained only by convection systems within north-south striking fault zones. The regional flow regime is therefore significantly influenced by the convective fluid flux in major north-south striking faults. Investigations of temperature anomalies in the Rhine Graben must take into account this north-south flow. Since the presented results correlate with findings from other geothermal anomalies in the Rhine Graben such as the one at Soultz, we suspect this to be a general feature of the major north-south striking faults there. Moreover, since in most grabenlike structures thermal anomalies are associated with the Graben master faults, the present study may provide common clues for investigating other graben-parallel temperature anomalies.},

abstract = {Analysis of numerous pollen diagrams from north and central Germany and from the adjacent lowlands of The Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Belarus have facilitated a regional comparison of the vegetation and climatic evolution from the beginning of the Early Weichselian glaciation to the Weichselian pleniglacial. Data from geological studies and analysis of fossil beetles and plant macroremains have been used to supplement the palaeoclimatic reconstruction.Up to the end of the Oerel Interstadial the palaeoclimate was characterised by increasing continentality. The winter temperatures in particular tended to fall continuously during the stadials and the interstadials of the Early Weichselian and early Pleniglacial. In the Br{\"{o}}rup and Odderade Interstadials summer temperatures where sufficiently high to enable boreal forests to grow, whereas in the Oerel Interstadial summer temperatures were such that tree growth was inhibited. It is probable that falling sea-level and the consequent extension northwards of the North Sea coast were the main causes of increasing continentality.In the latter part of the Pleniglacial, peat accumulation frequently took place and humic silts were deposited under lacustrine conditions. Correlation between various sites is extraordinarily difficult. Pollen diagrams from the so-called interstadials of the Glinde, Moershoofd Complex, Hengelo and Denekamp are similar to those of the known Early Weichselian stadials. It is proposed therefore that these interstadials should be called intervals, and that the term interstadial be reserved for climatic variations that result in distinctive pollen assemblages and which, in turn, reflect distinctive vegetation dynamics. Interstadials should be capable of being characterised on a biostratigraphical basis and it should be possible to establish correlations over considerable distances. According to this definition, the first three warm oscillations of the Weichselian glaciation in the central European lowlands are the Br{\"{o}}rup, Odderade and Oerel Interstadials. All other pleniglacial peat layers should be assigned the rank of interval. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

role of Zechstein evaporitic deposits during basin evolution

nian segment of the MPT has been constructed that includes
significant decoupling between pre-Zechstein basement and
Mesozoic sedimentary infill. In areas without significant in-
fluence of Zechstein deposits on tectonic processes, classical
inversion structures have been interpreted like reverse faults
and uplifted basement blocks. Thickness reductions and lo-
cal angular unconformities pointing to syn-tectonic sedimen-
tation often accompany these inversion structures. Correla-
tion of well and seismic data allows for fairly precise dating
of the inversion activity in various parts of the MPT. For the
NW segment indirect observations suggest that inversion ac-
tivity spanned Turonian to Campanian times, whereas in SE
segment inversion could have started in Coniacian, was ac-
tive in Santonian and Campanian, and reached its peak in
Maastrichtian times. Inversion along the NE boundary of
the MPT (Koszalin-Chojnice tectonic zone) was associated
with strike-slip movements. In this area the first stage of the
inversion-related uplift of axial part of the MPT can be dated
as post-Turonian and pre-Maastrichtian, the second stage,
related to strike-slip movements, as middle Maastrichtian.
Maastrichtian is also the age of transverse strike-slip activ-
ity along Gr ́ jec fault. All these dates generally conform to

abstract = {A retrograde sequence of fluid-controlled, low-temperature mineral reactions has been preserved along an east-west striking, dextral-oblique-slip fault in the uplifted Rhine Graben shoulder. This fault (the Schauenburg Fault, near Heidelberg), juxtaposes Permian rhyolite against Carboniferous (Variscan) granite and shows syn- or post-rift displacement of the north–south trending, eastern boundary fault of the rift basin. Both mineral texture and rock fabric indicate that the fault forms a site of high rock permeability and fluid flow, and records the exhumation and fluid-rock history of the rift shoulder since the Mesozoic. The reaction sequence and mineral compositions of the clay minerals within the cataclasite, and adjacent granite and rhyolite lithologies, document progressively decreasing fluid temperatures, with back-reactions of pure 2M1 illite to 1Md (R3) illite-smectite, and eventually smectite and kaolinite assemblages. Compositional variations are attributed to Tertiary to Recent fluid flushing of the fault zone associated with rift flank uplift, and with progressive dilution of the electrolyte-rich, acidic to neutral hydrothermal brines by down-flowing electrolyte-poor, meteoric waters.},

abstract = {Deformation bands represent a common type of strain localization in deformed porous sandstones and occur as single structures, as clusters, and in fault damage zones. They show from zero to six orders of magnitude reduction in permeability and may therefore potentially affect fluid flow. We here present mathematical calculations indicating that uncommonly high permeability contrasts and/or exceptionally high band concentrations are required for deformation bands to significantly affect production rate. We also present field observations showing rapid variations in porosity and permeability along deformation bands and deformation-band zones alike. Furthermore, many paleofluid fronts seen in the field are unaffected or only gently affected by deformation bands. Together, these calculations and observations suggest that their function during reservoir production is small or negligible in most cases. Structural complications caused by subseismic faulting and complex fault anatomy are more likely to cause production problems, in addition to stratigraphic and diagenetic effects. Nevertheless, the arrangement and orientation of deformation bands may have an effect on the flow pattern and reservoir sweep. In cases where deformation bands do cause production problems, it may be possible to resolve these by means of hydraulic fracturing.},

abstract = {More than 10,000 heat flow determinations exist for the earth and the data set is growing steadily at about 450 observations per year. If heat flow is considered as a surface expression of geothermal processes at depth, the analysis of the data set should reveal properties of those thermal processes. They do, but on a variety of scales. For this review heat flow maps are classified by 4 different horizontal scales of 10n km (n = 1, 2, 3 and 4) and attention is focussed on the interpretation of anomalies which appear with characteristic dimensions of 10(n - 1) km in the respective representations. The largest scale of 104 km encompasses heat flow on a global scale. Global heat loss is 4 x 1013 W and the process of sea floor spreading is the principal agent in delivering much of this heat to the surface. Correspondingly, active ocean ridge systems produce the most prominent heat flow anomalies at this scale with characteristic widths of 103 km. Shields, with similar dimensions, exhibit negative anomalies. The scale of 103 km includes continent wide displays. Heat flow patterns at this scale mimic tectonic units which have dimensions of a few times 102 km, although the thermal boundaries between these units are sometimes sharp. Heat flow anomalies at this scale also result from plate tectonic processes, and are associated with arc volcanism, back arc basins, hot spot traces, and continental rifting. There are major controversies about the extent to which these surface thermal provinces reflect upper mantle thermal conditions, and also about the origin and evolution of the thermal state of continental lithosphere. Beginning with map dimensions of 102 km thermal anomalies of scale 101 km, which have a definite crustal origin, become apparent. The origin may be tectonic, geologic, or hydrologic. Ten kilometers is a common wavelength of topographic relief which drives many groundwater flow systems producing thermal anomalies. The largest recognized continental geothermal systems have thermal anomalies 101 km wide and are capable of producing hundreds of megawatts of thermal energy. The smallest scale addressed in this paper is 101 km. Worldwide interest in exploiting geothermal systems has been responsible for a recent accumulation of heat flow data on the smallest of scales considered here. The exploration nature of the surveys involve 10's of drillholes and reveal thermal anomalies having widths of 100 km. These are almost certainly connected to surface and subsurface fluid discharge systems which, in spite of their restricted size, are typically delivering 10 MW of heat to the near surface environment.},

abstract = {Radiogenic heat production (RHP) represents a significant fraction of surface heat flow, both on cratons and in sedimentary basins. RHP within continental crust—especially the upper crust—is high. RHP at any depth within the crust can be estimated as a function of crustal age. Mantle RHP, in contrast, is always low, contributing at most 1 to 2 mW/m2 to total heat flow. Radiogenic heat from any noncrystalline basement that may be present also contributes to total heat flow. RHP from metamorphic rocks is similar to or slightly lower than that from their precursor sedimentary rocks. When extension of the lithosphere occurs—as for example during rifting—the radiogenic contribution of each layer of the lithosphere and noncrystalline basement diminishes in direct proportion to the degree of extension of that layer. Lithospheric RHP today is somewhat less than in the distant past, as a result of radioactive decay. In modeling, RHP can be varied through time by considering the half lives of uranium, thorium, and potassium, and the proportional contribution of each of those elements to total RHP from basement. RHP from sedimentary rocks ranges from low for most evaporites to high for some shales, especially those rich in organic matter. The contribution to total heat flow of radiogenic heat from sediments depends strongly on total sediment thickness, and thus differs through time as subsidence and basin filling occur. RHP can be high for thick clastic sections. RHP in sediments can be calculated using ordinary or spectral gamma-ray logs, or it can be estimated from the lithology.},

abstract = {Using a combination of fluid inclusion and mineralogical techniques, chemical data have been obtained that help characterise the hydrogeochemistry of palaeogroundwaters in the onshore section of the Eastern Irish Sea Basin, northwest England. The study area, Sellafield, provided an excellent suite of fracture-controlled carbonate cements deposited from shallow to deeply circulating late Triassic to Recent groundwaters. Methodologies developed for the analysis of hydrothermal fluid inclusions were extended to encompass a wide range of low temperature aqueous inclusions. These included single inclusion chemical analysis by UV laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry (Na, K, Mg, Sr, Li, Mn, Fe) and high precision salinity measurements (+/-1000 ppm TDS) by microthermometric analysis. Closely integrated with these measurements were calcite morphology and cathodoluminescence (CL) studies that were undertaken to provide a relative chronology `stratigraphy' of carbonate cementation and information on redox conditions and salinity with depth. The results demonstrate a clear distinction between the chemistry of the late Triassic groundwaters and the present day, deep, saline groundwaters. Though both have TDS values \textgreater100,000 ppm, the former are Ca-Na-Cl brines with Na/Ca wt ratios of 2:1, whilst the latter are Na-Cl brines with Na/Ca wt. ratios greater than 20. For younger generations of calcite, attributable to deposition from groundwater during the Quaternary, TDS values are \textless100,000 ppm with salinities typically less than 20,000 ppm. Laser ablation analyses of aqueous inclusions in these younger calcites for Na, Sr and Mg plot exactly within the fields defined by the present day saline to brackish groundwaters, and display similar trends. CL patterns for the Quaternary calcites are primarily a function of trace element impurities (Fe and Mn), but all show a marked contrast at the fresh water-saline water transition. This contrast is also reflected in the morphology of the calcite crystals; from c-axis shortened `nailhead' forms in the fresh groundwater zone to c-axis elongated `scalenohedra' forms in the deeper saline zones. Implications for the evolution of the palaeogroundwaters in response to Tertiary uplift with respect to present day groundwater regimes are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In the southern Rio Grande rift, two extensional regimes of different origin (but transitional with each other through the Miocene) can be interpreted from structures and rocks formed within the past 28 to 29 m.y. The earlier regime, which began about 28 to 29 m.y. B.P., is characterized by emplacement of “basaltic andesite” flows with relatively high strontium isotope ratios; formation of broad, relatively deep, northwest-trending basins; and incipient uplift of some of the region's fault-block mountains. This regime appears to have developed in a back-arc setting, perhaps behind a rapidly steepening slab and a westward-sweeping arc system.
The younger episode seemingly represents a renewal or acceleration of block faulting and volcanism during the latest Miocene and Pliocene, 9 to 3 m.y. B.P., after a long transitional period during the early and mid-Miocene when volcanism was absent and tectonism was less vigorous. The latest Miocene-Pliocene episode produced the modern northerly-trending rift basins and uplifts, regional uplift of the rift 1 to 2 km above sea level, and renewal of volcanism, this time dominated by relatively primitive alkali-olivine basalt. New basalt dates reveal that in the southern rift, modern ranges and basins were almost fully developed and that near-modern drainage ways were established across uplifts into bolsons by about 5.0 m.y. B.P. An ancestral Rio Grande had extended itself southward into the southern rift by 3 to 4 m.y. B.P., and the river entrenched itself into its modern valley between 0.7 and 0.5 m.y. B.P.
Horst-graben development of the southern Basin and Range province, as well as associated basaltic volcanism, swept progressively eastward from southeastern California in the past 20 m.y., culminating in formation of the Rio Grande rift and other fault-block terrane in west Texas, New Mexico, and northern Chihuahua in the latest Miocene and Pliocene. Late Quaternary Basin and Range fault scarps increase in density eastward, which also suggests that more easterly parts of the province are youngest. These relationships support a previous model of an eastward-expanding, slab-free triangle (related to growth of the San Andreas transform), through which mantle upwelling triggers eastward-younging patterns of tectonism, volcanism, and uplift and promotes lithospheric thinning and increased heat flow. Across most of the southern Basin and Range and Rio Grande rift, the horst-graben structures related to growth of this triangle are superimposed on somewhat older (late Oligocene-middle Miocene) extensional terrane that appears to have formed in a back-arc or arc setting.},

abstract = {We present a new estimate of the Earth's heat loss based on a new global compilation of heat flow measurements comprising 24,774 observations at 20,201 sites. On a 5° × 5° grid, the observations cover 62% of the Earth's surface. Empirical estimators, referenced to geological map units and derived from the observations, enable heat flow to be estimated in areas without measurements. Corrections for the effects of hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust compensate for the advected heat undetected in measurements of the conductive heat flux. The mean heat flows of continents and oceans are 65 and 101 mW m−2, respectively, which when areally weighted yield a global mean of 87 mW m−2 and a global heat loss of 44.2 × 1012 W, an increase of some 4-8% over earlier estimates. More than half of the Earth's heat loss comes from Cenozoic oceanic lithosphere. A spherical harmonic analysis of the global heat flow field reveals strong sectoral components and lesser zonal strength. The spectrum principally reflects the geographic distribution of the ocean ridge system. The rate at which the heat flow spectrum loses strength with increasing harmonic degree is similar to the decline in spectral strength exhibited by the Earth's topography. The spectra of the gravitational and magnetic fields fall off much more steeply, consistent with field sources in the lower mantle and core, respectively. Families of continental and oceanic conductive geotherms indicate the range of temperatures existing in the lithosphere under various surface heat flow conditions. The heat flow field is very well correlated with the seismic shear wave velocity distribution near the top of the upper mantle.},

abstract = {Abstract The Urach 3 research borehole in south-west (SW) Germany has been drilled through the sedimentary cover, and the gneisses of the Variscian crystalline basement at 1600 m below the surface (Black Forest basement) has been reached. An additional 2800 m has been drilled through the fractured crystalline rocks, and the borehole has been used for a number of hydraulic tests in the context of a 'hot-dry rock' (HDR) project exploring for geothermal energy. The fracture system of the basement is saturated with a NaCl brine with about 70 g L-1 dissolved solids. Water table measurements in the borehole cover a period of 13 years of observation, during which the water table continuously dropped and did not reach a steady-state level. This unique set of data shows that the hydraulic potential decreases with depth, causing a continuous flow of fluid to the deeper parts of the upper continental crust. The potential decrease and the associated downward migration of fluid is an evidence for the progress of water (H2O)-consuming reactions in the crystalline rocks. Computed stability relations among relevant phases at the pressure temperature (PT) conditions in the fracture system and documented fossil fracture coatings in granites and gneisses suggest that the prime candidate for the H2O-consuming reaction is the zeolitization of feldspar. The potential of the gneisses to chemically bind H2O matches the estimated amount of migrating H2O.},

The imagery, combined with shallow core, deep borehole, and two-dimensional seismic reflection data, shows a marked asymmetry in the bedrock outcrop and structural style, both across and along the axis of the basin. For example, the oldest synrift rocks crop out in a complex south-verging anticline along one margin, whereas more massively bedded younger rocks are folded into a simpler anticline at the other. Comparison of our observations with both recent analog modeling and a neighboring inverted basin highlights the importance of the mechanical properties of the basin stratigraphy in controlling the structural development.

Quantitative reconstructions of the temperature regime are derived from periglacial, Coleoptera and botanical evidence, while aeolian and fluvial evidence provide qualitative information on wind activity and precipitation respectively.The Early Pleniglacial (74-59 ka), the cold period between 41-38 ka and the Late Pleniglacial (27-13 ka) are characterised by a strong north to south climatic gradient over northwestern Europe. During the last-glacial maximum discontinuous permafrost was established in northern France, whereas the continuous permafrost zone extended from the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and Poland to the nordic ice sheets. Prominent wind activity and a relatively low precipitation typify these periods. In contrast, an indistinct west to east climate gradient was present in the relatively more temperate intervals (e.g. 50-41 ka). Seasonally frozen ground conditions prevailed in northwestern Europe whereas discontinuous permafrost may be suggested for central Germany.It appears that the climate conditions in northwest and central Europe were controlled by three major factors: the Scandinavian ice sheet, the North Atlantic surface water (circulation) and the Russian continent. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 20201340 We present a thermodynamic model for mineral dissolution in aqueous fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures, based on intrinsic thermal properties and variations of volumetric properties of the aqueous solvent. The standard thermodynamic properties of mineral dissolution into aqueous fluid consist of two contributions: one from the energy of transformation from the solid to the hydrated-species state and the other from the compression of solvent molecules during the formation of a hydration shell. The latter contribution has the dimension of the generalized Krichevskii parameter. This approach describes the energetics of solvation more accurately than does the Born electrostatic theory and can be extended beyond the limits of experimental measurements of the dielectric constant of H2O. The new model has been calibrated by experimental solubilities of quartz, corundum, rutile, calcite, apatite, fluorite and portlandite in pure H2O at temperatures up to 1100�C and pressures up to 20�kbar. All minerals show a steady increase in solubility along constant geothermal gradients or water isochores. By contrast, isobaric solubilities initially increase with rising temperature but then decline above 2002013400�C. This retrograde behavior is caused by variations in the isobaric expansivity of the aqueous solvent, which approaches infinity at its critical point. Oxide minerals predominantly dissolve to neutral species; so, their dissolution energetics involve a relatively small contribution from the solvent volumetric properties and their retrograde solubilities are restricted to a relatively narrow window of temperature and pressure near the critical point of water. By contrast, Ca-bearing minerals dissolve to a variety of charged species; so, the energetics of their dissolution reactions involve a comparatively large contribution from volume changes of the aqueous solvent and their isobaric retrograde solubility spans nearly all metamorphic and magmatic conditions. These features correlate with and can be predicted from the standard partial molar volumes of aqueous species. The thermodynamic model can be used over much wider range of settings for terrestrial fluid2013rock interaction than has previously been possible. To illustrate, it is integrated with transport theory to show quantitatively that integrated fluid fluxes characteristic of crustal shear zones are capable of precipitating quartz or calcite veins from low- and medium-grade metamorphic conditions, at a geothermal gradient of 20�C�km22121. For subduction zones, modeled by a geotherm of 7�C�km22121, the required fluid fluxes are one to two orders of magnitude lower and predict enhanced efficiency of mass transfer and metasomatic precipitation in comparison with orogenic settings. The new model thus can be applied to shallow hydrothermal, metamorphic, magmatic and subduction fluids, and for retrieval of dependent thermodynamic properties for mass transfer or geodynamic modeling.},

An examination of the mechanisms that might produce such flow suggests that the only realistic possibility is head decay from an earlier higher water level caused by ancient recharge. Model studies suggest that for small basins, such recharge must have taken place within the last 1000 years and possibly within the last few hundred years, calling into question whether such resources should be labelled fossil. Recent palaeoclimatic studies of northern Chile show several pluvial periods throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, inaddition to long return period storm events, which continue to the present and which might have led to a series of pulsed flushing events in aquifers. Hence, it is incorrect to label groundwater resources as either fossil or actively recharged, as there is, in reality, a continuum between the two, and all such aquifers require site-specific evaluation and new, more flexible guidelines for development.},

This system included essentially coeval changes in the regional tectonics, which repeatedly modified the tectono-sedimentary and paleogeographic setting of the graben system.},

abstract = {The Central European Basin System (CEBS) is composed of a series of subbasins, the largest of which are (1) the Norwegian-Danish Basin (2), the North German Basin extending westward into the southern North Sea and (3) the Polish Basin. A 3D structural model of the CEBS is presented, which integrates the thickness of the crust below the Permian and five layers representing the Permian-Cenozoic sediments. Structural interpretations derived from the 3D model and from backstripping are discussed with respect to published seismic data. The analysis of structural relationships across the CEBS suggests that basin evolution was controlled to a large degree by the presence of major zones of crustal weakness. The NW-SE-striking Tornquist Zone, the Ringkobing-Fyn High (RFH) and the Elbe Fault System (EFS) provided the borders for the large Permo-Mesozoic basins, which developed along axes parallel to these fault systems. The Tornquist Zone, as the most prominent of these zones, limited the area affected by Permian-Cenozoic subsidence to the north. Movements along the Tornquist Zone, the margins of the Ringkobing-Fyn High and the Elbe Fault System could have influenced basin initiation. Thermal destabilization of the crust between the major NW-SE-striking fault systems, however, was a second factor controlling the initiation and subsidence in the Permo-Mesozoic basins. In the Triassic, a change of the regional stress field caused the formation of large grabens (Central Graben, Horn Graben, Gluckstadt Graben) perpendicular to the Tornquist Zone, the Ringkobing-Fyn High and the Elbe Fault System. The resulting subsidence pattern can be explained by a superposition of declining thermal subsidence and regional extension. This led to a dissection of the Ringkobing-Fyn High, resulting in offsets of the older NW-SE elements by the younger N-S elements. In the Late Cretaceous, the NW-SE elements were reactivated during compression, the direction of which was such that it did not favour inversion of N-S elements. A distinct change in subsidence controlling factors led to a shift of the main depocentre to the central North Sea in the Cenozoic. In this last phase, N-S-striking structures in the North Sea and NW-SE-striking structures in The Netherlands are reactivated as subsidence areas which are in line with the direction of present maximum compression. The Moho topography below the CEBS varies over a wide range. Below the N-S-trending Cenozoic depocentre in the North Sea, the crust is only 20 km thick compared to about 30 km below the largest part of the CEBS. The crust is up to 40 km thick below the Ringkobing-Fyn High and up to 45 km along the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone. Crustal thickness gradients are present across the Tornquist Zone and across the borders of the Ringkobing-Fyn High but not across the Elbe Fault System. The N-S-striking structural elements are generally underlain by a thinner crust than the other parts of the CEBS. The main fault systems in the Permian to Cenozoic sediment fill of the CEBS are located above zones in the deeper crust across which a change in geophysical properties as P-wave velocities or gravimetric response is observed. This indicates that these structures served as templates in the crustal memory and that the prerift configuration of the continental crust is a major controlling factor for the subsequent basin evolution.},

Other experimental factors may introduce additional non-Poissonian errors, which must be taken into account. In the population method, sampling of non-homogeneous uranium distributions introduces experimental error. In the external detector method (EDM), many factors exist to introduce such error. Simply quoting total numbers of spontaneous and induced fission tracks obtained by the EDM may disguise the possible influence of experimental variation. The present work concentrates on the EDM, and describes a test which has recently been proposed to detect the presence of experimental error in EDM analyses. The question of an alternative analysis for cases where such error is present is also considered. A method of presenting EDM data is suggeted, which allows assessment of the importance of experimental errors.},

We analysed the influence of time-dependent permeability of faults on the overpressure history and evolution of petroleum systems. We favour time-dependent permeability of faults as the most likely option to explain the present-day near-hydrostatic conditions in the basin, the known location of oil fields, and the location and characteristics of the gas occurrences. The model results further show that the difference in timing of oil charging of the P9 and Q1 Lower Cretaceous oil reservoirs, explains the observed differences in geochemical composition of the accumulated oils. The biodegraded and water-washed nature of the pre-inversion charged Q1 oil reservoir is consistent with the concentrated topography-induced groundwater flow through the Lower Cretaceous reservoir units during the Late Cretaceous inversion period. Late charging of the oil reservoir in the P9 area explains the non-biodegraded character of the accumulated oils. Present-day conditions in the Broad Fourteens Basin are near-hydrostatic. In general, this paper shows that paleohydrodynamic conditions and time-dependent permeability of the hydrogeological framework have influenced significantly the petroleum systems in the basin.},

abstract = {Thermal histories derived from apatite fission-track data are remarkably consistent irrespective of tectonic setting and overall rate of cooling. Rapid cooling through the partial annealing zone is typically followed by slower cooling, and such histories can only be explained by systematic errors in the experimentally derived annealing rates used to determine the thermal histories, or a consistent geotherm shape characterized by a relatively low geothermal gradient in the uppermost crust. Differences between the cooling paths characterizing individual tectonic settings indicate that geotherm shape influences the cooling histories. This suggests that crustal geotherms, especially those in orogenic belts, are characterized by a shallow zone of high permeability, allowing the rapid transfer of heat by fluid advection, perhaps together with a near-surface zone affected by enhanced heat loss due to topographic effects. The influence of such controls on cooling histories must be considered prior to using thermochronology data to constrain denudation histories.},

We compare these movements to (a) mean tectonic, isostatic and compaction movements at time scales of millions of years obtained by backstripping of Cenozoic stratigraphy, and (b) estimates of recent ( 100 yr) movements from process modelling of isostasy (glacio- and hydro-isostasy) and compaction. The process rates at time scales of millions of years are insufficient to account for the geodetic observations by an order of magnitude. The isostasy and compaction rates inferred for the last century are also insufficient; they explain less than half of the observed movements. This suggests that the residual – observed rates less isostasy and compaction estimates – which is interpreted to represent tectonic crustal deformation, constitutes an important contribution to present-day movements. The surprisingly high rates of short-term tectonic vertical movements in a region which is relatively inactive, seismically, indicate that correction of tide-gauge records for the glacio-isostatic signal alone does not yield an appropriate measure of eustatic sea-level rise along the Dutch coast.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 2172013233 Permeability enhancement associated with deformation processes in faults and shear zones plays a key role in facilitating fluid redistribution between fluid reservoirs in the crust. Especially in high fluid flux hydrothermal systems, fracture-controlled permeability can be relatively short-lived, unless it is repeatedly regenerated by ongoing deformation. Failure mode diagrams in pore fluid factor and differential stress space, here termed 03BB201303C3 failure mode diagrams, provide a powerful tool for analysing how fluid pressure and stress states drive failure, associated permeability enhancement and vein styles during deformation in faults and shear zones. During fault-valve behaviour in the seismogenic regime, relative rates of recovery of pore fluid factor, differential stress and fault cohesive strength between rupture events impact on styles of veining and associated, fracture-controlled permeability enhancement in faults and shear zones. Examples of vein-rich fault zones are used to illustrate how constraints can be placed, not just on fluid pressure and stress states at failure, but also on the fluid pressurization and loading paths associated with failure and transitory permeability enhancement in faults and shear zones. This provides insights about when, during the fault-valve cycle, various types of veins can form. The use of failure mode diagrams also provides insights about the relative roles of optimally oriented faults and misoriented faults as hydraulically conductive structures. The analysis highlights the dynamics of competition between fluid pressures and loading rates in driving failure and repeated permeability regeneration in fracture-controlled, hydrothermal systems.},

abstract = {A new model for examining fission-track data from natural specimens has been developed on the basis of new laboratory data describing fission-track annealing in a wide variety of apatites and the empirical correction for fission-track length anisotropy presented in earlier papers. Using revised and simplified statistical methods, we examine how well various empirical equations are able to fit the laboratory data and reproduce expected behavior on geological time scales. Based on the latter criterion, we find that so-called “fanning Arrhenius” models of mean track length are not the bestsuited for our data. Instead, we find that fitting c-axis projected lengths with a model that incorporates some curvature on an Arrhenius plot produces results that are in better agreement with the available geological benchmarks. In examining the relative annealing behavior of apatites with different resistance to annealing, we find that the laboratory-time-scale behavior of any two apatites can be reproduced well by a simple one- or two-parameter equation. This function is used to convert the reduced fission-track length of one apatite that has undergone a certain time-temperature history into the length that would be measured in a second, less-resistant apatite that has undergone the same history. Using this conversion, we create a single model that encompasses the annealing behavior of all of the apatites we studied. The predictions made by this model match closely those made by fits to data for individual apatites. We therefore infer that, although the conversion equation is imperfect, it presents an excellent practical solution to characterizing the range of kinetic variability for annealing of fission tracks in apatite.},

@article{Thiry2006,
abstract = {During the early Cretaceous, successive tectonic phases and several sea level falls resulted in the emersion of the main part of western Europe and the development of thick "lateritic" weathering. This long period of continental evolution ended with the Upper Cretaceous transgressions. During this period, the exposed lands displayed a mosaic of diverse morphologies and weathered landscapes.  Bauxites are the most spectacular paleoweathering features, known for long in southern France. Recently, new residual outcrops have been identified, trapped in the karstic depressions of the Grands Causses. Other bauxitic formations, containing gibbsite, have also been recognised, occurring with the Clay-with-Jurassic-cherts in the southeastern border of the Paris Basin. These bauxitic formations overlay Jurassic limestone and are buried beneath Upper Cretaceous marine deposits. The recognition of bauxites up north into the southern Paris Basin significantly widens the extension of the Lower Cretaceous bauxitic paleolandscapes.  On the Hercynian basements thick kaolinitic weathering mantles occur. They have been classically ascribed to the Tertiary. The first datings of these in situ paleosoils, by means of paleomagnetism and/or radiogenic isotopes, record especially early Cretaceous ages. This is the case for the "Siderolithic" formations on the edges of the French Massif Central, but also for the kaolinitic profiles in the Belgian Ardennes. In the Flanders, the Brabant basement is deeply kaolinised beneath the Upper Cretaceous cover. These paleosoils show polygenetic evolutions. The relief of these basement paleolandscapes may have been significant. There where probably high scarps (often of tectonic origin) reaching 200 m in elevation or beyond, as well as wide surfaces with inselbergs, as in the present day landscapes of tropical Africa and South America.  On the Jurassic limestone platforms occur diverse kaolinitic and ferruginous weathering products. Around the Paris Basin they show various facies, ranging from kaolinitic saprolites to ferricretes. Due to the lack of sedimentary cover, the age of these ferruginous and kaolinitic weathering products has been debated for long, most often allocated to the Siderolithic sensu lato (Eocene-Oligocene). Recent datings by paleomagnetism have enabled to date them (Borne de Fer in eastern Paris Basin) back also to the early Cretaceous (130 {+/-} 10 Ma). These wide limestone plateaus show karstified paleolandforms, such as vast closed and flat depressions broken by conical buttes, but also deep sinkholes in the higher areas of the plateaus and piedmonts. The depth of the karst hollows may be indicative of the range of relative paleoelevations. Dissolution holes display seldom contemporaneous karst fillings, thus implying that the karstland had not a thick weathering cover or that this cover had been stripped off before or by the late Cretaceous transgression. Nevertheless, some areas, especially above chert-bearing Jurassic limestone or marl, show weathering products trapped in the karst features or as a thick weathering mantle.  In the Paris Basin, the Wealden gutter looked like a wide floodplain in which fluvio-deltaic sands and clays were deposited and on which paleosoils developed during times of non-deposition. The edges of the gutter were shaped as piedmonts linked up with the upstream basement areas. The rivers flowing down to the plain deposited lobes of coarse fluvial sands and conglomerates. The intensity of the weathering, the thickness of the profiles and their maturation are directly dependent on the duration of the emersion and the topographic location relative to the gutter. Near the axis of the gutter, where emersion was of limited duration, the paleoweathering features are restricted to rubefaction and argillization of the Lower Cretaceous marine formations. On the other hand, on the borders of the basin and on the Hercynian basement, where emersion was of longer duration, the weathering profiles are thicker and more intensively developed.  The inventory of the Lower Cretaceous paleoweathering features shows the complexity of the continental history of this period. Moreover, the preserved weathering products are only a part of this long lasting period, all the aspects relative to erosion phases are still more difficult to prove and to quantify. In this domain, apatite fission tracks thermochronology (AFTT) can be helpful to estimate the order of magnitude of denudation. Residual testimonies and subsequent transgressions may enable to estimate relative elevations, but in return, we presently have no reliable tool to estimate absolute paleoelevations. In the work presented here, the inventory enabled to draw a continental paleogeographic map showing the nature of the weathering mantles and the paleolandscape features, just as paleoenvironments and paleobathymetry presently appear on marine paleogeographic maps. For the future, the challenge is to make progress in dating the paleoweathering profiles and especially in the resolution of these datings, in order to correlate precisely the continental records with the different events which trigger them (eustatism, climate, regional and global geodynamics). The final goal will be to build up a stratigraphic scale of the "continental geodynamic and climatic events" in parallel with "sequential stratigraphy" in the marine realm.},

abstract = {The Nieuwerkerk Formation is a major Lower Cretaceous synrift and postrift fluvial unit in the West Netherlands Basin (southwest Netherlands) that attains thicknesses in excess of 1 km in places. A strong tectonic overprint on its deposition and a large degree of facies heterogeneity have complicated correlation and greatly hampered understanding reservoir and seal distribution within the unit. The integrated application of fluvial sequence stratigraphic concepts with biostratigraphic dating and the correlation of cycles of changing accommodation to sediment supply ratio (A/S cycles) on three-dimensional (3-D) seismic, well-log, and core data have allowed a much improved understanding of reservoir facies distribution within the Nieuwerkerk Formation.

A major intraformational unconformity divides the Nieuwerkerk Formation into two members. The lower of these, the Alblasserdam Member, is predominantly nonmarine and has a significant tectonic depositional overprint. Correlation within this member is dependent on the identification of base-level transit cycles probably induced by pulses of tectonism. The inclusion of 3-D seismic isopach data facilitates mapping thicknesses and reservoir properties of the Alblasserdam Member in areas with no well control. The upper member, the Rodenrijs Claystone Member, was deposited during the postrift stage and is predominantly a coastal-plain succession. Biostratigraphic correlation proved useful in subdividing this unit and correlating key seismostratigraphic markers. Use of biostratigraphic and cyclostratigraphic correlation techniques allowed chronostratigraphically consistent reservoir maps to be made of the constituent members of the Nieuwerkerk Formation. These maps exhibit localized nonmarine syndepositional basins (Alblasserdam Member sand depocenters), followed by gradual southward, landward stepping of facies tracts of the Rodenrijs Claystone Member above the intraformational unconformity. The Rodenrijs Claystone Member is capped by a marine transgression that terminated fluvial deposition in this part of the basin. Interestingly, no major lacustrine facies have been identified in the fluvial units in the West Netherlands Basin, rendering it somewhat anomalous among rift basins.},

abstract = {The ratio R of the densities of etchable fission tracks in a mineral and co-irradiated external detector is shown to depend on the length ratios of the latent (Lf/Lf') and etched fission tracks (Le/Le') in the two media. Calculations of Lf for apatite, titanite zircon and Lf' for muscovite external detectors allow a precise determination of R, and confirm that neglecting R could constitute the most significant source of systematic error in fission-track dating with the external detector method. The ratios of the measured fission-track densities in an external and internal surface of apatite and a muscovite external detector are calculated from R and the track counting efficiencies [eta]q. The fact that the results are consistent with the experiment supports the accuracy of R and of the [eta]q-factors. The external detector ages of a basal and prismatic section of Durango apatite are consistent with its reference age, without the need for a length correction. A critical examination of the uncertainties related to the thermal neutron fluence measurements, fission-decay constant, calculated R-value, independently determined [eta]q-factors and the reference age of the standard, demonstrates that the assumption that a reduction of the confined track length of the spontaneous tracks in Durango apatite necessitates a proportional correction of its apparent fission-track age is the element most in question. Published U/Th-He ages lend support to the conclusion that such a correction is not required. The significance of R and of the ratio Q of the [eta]q-factors for the induced and spontaneous track counts leads us to propose a formalisation of the age equation, in which these are included, as well as a formal length correction L, which is, however, not set equal to the ratio of the confined track lengths of the induced and spontaneous tracks. The accuracy of the thermal neutron fluence and the decay constant leads us to propose a possible deconvolution of the [zeta]-calibration factor. If, for suitable age standards L=1, the proposed deconvoluted calibration factor [zeta]0 is a function of R and Q, which can be determined in ways that are independent of the reference ages of the standards. This can either be interpreted as a multiple calibration or as establishing the fission-track method as an independent dating method.},

abstract = {The specific time window of apatite fission track thermochronology (AFTT) places it in a unique position to offer continuous time–temperature baseline histories for relatively stable shield, rift and passive margin environments, spanning several geological eras. Fission tracks anneal partially at temperatures between ap110 °C and ap60 °C and thereby provide information on residence times within specific levels of the crust. Most samples collected from these terrains, however, are usually found to have cooled out of the apatite partial annealing zone (APAZ) by the mid-Cenozoic at the latest. Owing to the stability, at geological timescales, of tracks at temperatures \textless60 °C (i.e. within depths of 0–2.5 km at normal geothermal gradients), a significant loss of resolution must therefore be reckoned with at shallow, although geomorphologically crucial, crustal depths. Indeed, the Neogene and Quaternary are understood to have been most influential in generating the scenery of today, and a use of radiometric and stratigraphic techniques in a nested, multisystem approach can assist in bridging the resolution gap. This paper examines and illustrates, mostly with original examples, the uses and limitations of AFTT in addressing the response of Earth surface systems to event patterns in global tectonics, the controls of lithology and structure on denudation rates, the origin and evolution of passive margin escarpments, the mass-balanced reconstruction of palaeoelief, the use of apatites as tracers for understanding provenance in sediment routing systems, and the tempo (or episodicity) of denudation as postulated by W. M. Davis' canons of the ‘geographical cycle'. Alongside efforts towards standardizing the supply of analytically robust AFT results in the laboratory, a more standardized geoscientific interpretation of AFT data is also desirable in order to build a consistent world base of geomorphic rates which can be made available to – and used with confidence by – non-AFTT specialists.},

abstract = {Since Vening-Meinesz's realization that the East African Rift represented an extensional, not compressional, feature and since the widespread acceptance of plate tectonics two decades later, research on the nature and causes of extensional tectonism within continental lithosphere has intensified. Among the manifestations of extensional processes affecting continental lithosphere are passive margins (Atlantic margin), discrete intracontinental rift zones (East African Rift), diffuse rifts (Basin and Range Province), strike-slip dominated rifts (Dead Sea Rift), and rifts in zones of regional compression (Tibetan grabens). Although no two rift zones are alike, continental rifts can generally be characterized by normal faulting with subsidiary strike-slip faulting, lithospheric thinning which outpaces crustal stretching, varying amounts of alkaline magmatism, heat flow that is locally elevated near faults and magmatic centers, and crust that has experienced magmatic underplating and some amount of magmatic intrusion. Most aspects of rift related deformation can be explained in terms of three parameters: (1) lithospheric and (sometimes) asthenospheric thermal structure, (2) lithospheric (particularly crustal) rheology, and (3) temporal factors such as the absolute age, timing, and rate of extension. The interaction of these physical parameters determines the eventual outcome of rifting (failure or progression to complete continental breakup), the patterns of subsidence and uplift, and the mode of extensional deformation. Modes of rifting (the lithosphere's mechanical response to extensional stress) can be broadly divided into pure shear, simple shear, and lower crustal flow mechanisms. In a general sense, these categories of rift mechanisms can account for observations at rifted margins, in the Basin and Range Province, and at metamorphic core complexes respectively. The mechanisms of continental lithosphere rifting (the effects) are here distinguished from the processes which actually drive extension (the causes). Following the terminology of previous authors, the causal processes are categorized as either passive or active: Passive processes originate at plate boundaries or in response to convective drag on the base of the lithosphere, while active processes are seated in the sublithospheric mantle and typically involve the interaction of mantle plumes and the lithospheric plates. A peculiar set of factors, including the local stress state, the retreat of a subducting plate, and convective instability of thickened crustal roots, may drive extension in compressional settings like Tibet. In the future, rifting studies are likely to focus on further clarification of the active and passive rifting terminology, better constraints on deformation rates and lithospheric rheology and thermal structure, along-axis segmentation of rifts, and the analogies and differences between rifting on Earth and nearby planets.},

abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

The gouge ratio, when applied to sand-shale sequences, indicates the proportion of phyllosilicate material that is expected to be incorporated into the fault rock, hence it provides a measure of the seal capacity. Gouge ratios for faulted reservoir sequences are computed from data that are routinely available from fields at the appraisal or production stage. We present a repeatable methodology that maximizes the use of seismically based geometric data and well-based stratigraphic and compositional data. The resulting gouge ratio calculations can be used comparatively at the scale of individual faults, fields or basins. We examine an example fault from the Oseberg Syd Field that is known to seal and we show that a threshold shale gouge ratio of 18% will support a cross-fault pressure difference of c. 8 bar.},

@article{Wibberley2008,
abstract = {It is increasingly apparent that faults are typically not discrete planes but zones of deformed rock with a complex internal structure and three-dimensional geometry. In the last decade this has led to renewed interest in the consequences of this complexity for modelling the impact of fault zones on fluid flow and mechanical behaviour of the Earth's crust. A number of processes operate during the development of fault zones, both internally and in the surrounding host rock, which may encourage or inhibit continuing fault zone growth. The complexity of the evolution of a faulted system requires changes in the rheological properties of both the fault zone and the surrounding host rock volume, both of which impact on how the fault zone evolves with increasing displacement. Models of the permeability structure of fault zones emphasize the presence of two types of fault rock components: fractured conduits parallel to the fault and granular core zone barriers to flow. New data presented in this paper on porosity-permeability relationships of fault rocks during laboratory deformation tests support recently advancing concepts which have extended these models to show that poro-mechanical approaches (e.g., critical state soil mechanics, fracture dilatancy) may be applied to predict the fluid flow behaviour of complex fault zones during the active life of the fault. Predicting the three-dimensional heterogeneity of fault zone internal structure is important in the hydrocarbon industry for evaluating the retention capacity of faults in exploration contexts and the hydraulic behaviour in production contexts. Across-fault reservoir juxtaposition or non-juxtaposition, a key property in predicting retention or across-fault leakage, is strongly controlled by the three-dimensional complexity of the fault zone. Although algorithms such as shale gouge ratio greatly help predict capillary threshold pressures, quantification of the statistical variation in fault zone composition will allow estimations of uncertainty in fault retention capacity and hence prospect reserve estimations. Permeability structure in the fault zone is an important issue because bulk fluid flow rates through or along a fault zone are dependent on permeability variations, anisotropy and tortuosity of flow paths. A possible way forward is to compare numerical flow models using statistical variations of permeability in a complex fault zone in a given sandstone/shale context with field-scale estimates of fault zone permeability. Fault zone internal structure is equally important in understanding the seismogenic behaviour of faults. Both geometric and compositional complexities can control the nucleation, propagation and arrest of earthquakes. The presence and complex distribution of different fault zone materials of contrasting velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening properties is an important factor in controlling earthquake nucleation and whether a fault slips seismogenically or creeps steadily, as illustrated by recent studies of the San Andreas Fault. A synthesis of laboratory experiments presented in this paper shows that fault zone materials which become stronger with increasing slip rate, typically then get weaker as slip rate continues to increase to seismogenic slip rates. Thus the probability that a nucleating rupture can propagate sufficiently to generate a large earthquake depends upon its success in propagating fast enough through these materials in order to give them the required velocity kick. This propagation success is hence controlled by the relative and absolute size distributions of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening rocks within the fault zone. Statistical characterisation of the distribution of such contrasting properties within complex fault zones may allow for better predictive models of rupture propagation in the future and provide an additional approach to earthquake size forecasting and early warnings.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional finite element models of coupled sediment compaction, variable-density ground-water flow, and conductive/convective heat transfer are used in this study to quantify basin hydrodynamics during the initial and flexural stages of continental rifting. The analysis also incorporates a two-stage stretching/cooling geodynamic model of the thermomechanical evolution of the lithosphere underlying the rift in order to specify geologically relevant boundary conditions for basin subsidence and basal heat flow. A sensitivity study is made using the model to explore the controls of both permeability and water table configuration in determining the dominant fluid flow drive (compaction, density, or topography) during basin evolution. The sensitivity analysis incorporates hydrologic conditions and rock properties representative of many extensional terrains. Assuming that rift basin subsidence and basal heat flow can be represented by the geodynamic model, two distinct ground-water flow systems evolve within continental rifts during basin evolution. During the initial (stretching) phase of rifting, subsidence is accommodated by fault block motion, and a topography-driven ground-water flow system develops within the permeable alluvial-fan deposits. Within the less permeable lacustrine facies located in the center of the basin, compaction-driven ground-water flow dominates. Here, the compacting lacustrine sediments focus pore fluids laterally from the basin center into the alluvial- fan deposits due to the relatively large permeability contrast between the two depositional environments. Thermal anomalies resulting from convective heat transfer are restricted to alluvial-fan facies near the basin-framing fault. During the thermal cooling (flexural) stage of basin development, laterally extensive onlap facies are deposited, and density-driven ground-water flow dominates in the permeable alluvial-fan deposits, while compaction-driven flow continues within the lacustrine and onlap facies. The presence of a permeable aquifer within the onlap facies resulted in long-range fluid transport to the edge of the basin. During both stages of basin evolution, ground-water velocities varied from 10 (super -5) to 10 (super -1) m/yr between the lacustrine and alluvial-fan deposits, respectively. The observed presence of ore mineralization within alluvial-fan deposits of some continental-rift systems, such as the Cretaceous Rift Basin of Angola, supports the findings of this study.

abstract = {Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation. It is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because $\rho$̇(t) does not depend only on $\rho$(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type $\rho$(t)=G(t, 0)$\rho$(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0 Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities.

These events leave higher temperature signatures in affected basins than predicted from burial under conditions of vertical conductive heat transfer, and should be considered during hydrocarbon appraisal of a prospective basin.

abstract = {asin modeling aims at reconstructing the time evolution of a sedimentary basin in order to make quantitative predictions of geological phenomena leading to hydrocarbons accumulations. It accounts for porous medium compaction, heat transfer, hydrocarbon generation and fluid flow. Nevertheless, classical basin models handle simple geometry and are not usable in complex geometry area such as foothills. This is why, a numerical prototype Ceres, has been developed. This prototype is able to model three-phase flow in a 2D section of a basin, whose geometry changes through time accounting for deposition, compaction, erosion of the sediments, salt or mud creeping, and block displacement along faults. The classical flow chart to perform a case study is composed of three main steps. The first step is the building of the present day section. This is generally done with data coming from the seismic interpretation, wells, outcrops, and core data. At this stage, the section is generally balanced using software such as Locace. The second step is the restoration of the section. The section at present day is restored back in the past for each of the defined layer until the substratum is reached. In order to balance the section during time and to constrain the eroded parts of the section, we have to use a forward kinematic modeling tool such as Thrustpack. Thus, from a section restored with Locace before thrusting, the use of Thrustpack allows to construct intermediate sections during time, which are consistent from a kinematics point of view. The last step is the forward simulation. And, in order to solve the coupled equations that are generally used in basin models, we had to develop original numerical methods based on domain decomposition techniques. The previous methodology is the fruit of tests performed for an Alberta (Canada) transect and an eastern Venezuelan transect. When considering the origin of the fluids in the Oligocene sandstones of the El Furrial structure or in the Mississipian dolomite of the Canadian foothills, a general scenario of squeegee fluids is recognized. Before the flexuring and thrusting period, fluids are in equilibrium with the sediments. They are being continuously expelled toward the surface during the compaction related dewatering. Then, because of the tilting and thrusting with the deposition of synflexural sediments, an episode of squeegee fluid is created with flow along the stratification that can reach velocity of tens of kilometers per million of years. This squeegee episode stops when the thrusts of the considered area become active.},

Data from multiple sources may be represented statistically by a finite mixture model, usually with two or three components, but data arising from the multicompositional annealing process may be better modelled as an infinite mixture. We discuss finite mixtures and two new infinite mixture models: a random effects model whose parameters describe the location and spread of the population grain ages, and a more general model encompassing both two-component mixtures and random effects.

abstract = {The Roer Valley rift system emerged since the Middle Miocene and fluvial sediments were supplied to it by the Rhine, Maas (Meuse) and local Belgian rivers. Ever since the emergence, thirty fluvial terraces of the lower Maas river have been formed due to regional uplift. Their age-altitude record shows strong evidence for an important acceleration of the tectonic activity at the end of the Pliocene (around 3 Ma), and for high-frequency oscillations superimposed on a general continuous trend. Three relaxation periods during the Quaternary were identified, the first from 1.5 to 1.2 Ma and two short ones around 5 ka BP and after 2 ka BP, respectively. The reactivations, following these relaxation periods, appear to be of plate-tectonic importance. The observed accelerations in tectonic activity since the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene to the present day, raise the question: are we at present living in a period of extremely high crustal dynamics? Floodplain positions of the rivers Rhine and Maas repeatedly changed in space and time. Strike-slip movements along the graben bounding faults explain this behaviour. The events point to punctuated changes in the stress field orientation, probably related to the interplay between Alpine and Ardennes-Rhenish Shield stress generators within the regional stress field.},

abstract = {Deep groundwater in fractured crystalline basement has been reported from deep mines and from scientific deep wells. Highly saline brines have been described from several km depth in the continental basement of the Canadian, Fennoscandian and Ukrainian shields and elsewhere in the world. The origin of salinity is unknown and many different possibilities have been presented. We compare the compositional evolution of deep waters in the Black Forest basement, SW Germany, with those of other deep crystalline waters, and use halogen systematics (e.g. Cl/Br ratios) and other parameters of the waters to deduce the origin of their salinity. In the Black Forest the composition of deep thermal waters results from chemical interaction of surface water with the rock matrix (mainly weathering of plagioclase and mica) and from mixing of the reacted water with stagnant saline deep water. Here we show by Na/TDS-and Cl/TDS-investigations, by molality-ratios of the Na and Cl concentrations, and by Cl/Br systematics that these deep saline waters have a marine origin. The Cl/Br ratios in deep crystalline waters are very close to normal marine ratios (Cl/Br = 288 ppm basis). In contrast, Cl/Br ratios of other possible sources of salinity show distinctly different Cl/Br ratios: water derived from dissolved Tertiary halite deposits of the rift valley is in the order of Cl/Br = 2400 and water from dissolved Muschelkalk halite deposits has values of about Cl/Br = 9900. Leaching experiments on crystalline rocks, on the other hand, show that the average Cl/Br ratio of crystalline rocks is far below Cl/Br = 100.},

abstract = {In the upper crust, where hydraulic gradients are typically \textless1 MPa km -1, advective heat transport is often effective for permeabilities k 10 -16 m 2 and advective mass (solute) transport for k 10 -20 m 2. Regional-scale analyses of coupled groundwater flow and heat transport in the upper crust typically infer permeabilities in the range of 10 -17 to 10 -14 m 2, so that heat advection is sometimes significant and solute advection should nearly always be significant. Analyses of metamorphic systems suggest that a geochemically significant level of permeability can exist to the base of the crust. In active metamorphic systems in the mid to lower crust, where vertical hydraulic gradients are likely \textgreater10 MPa km -1, the mean permeabilities required to accommodate the estimated metamorphic fluid fluxes decrease from 10 -16 m 2 to 10 -18 m 2 between 5- and 12-km depth. Below 12 km, which broadly corresponds to the brittle-plastic transition, mean k is effectively independent of depth at 10 -18.51 m 2. Consideration of the permeability values inferred from thermal modeling and metamorphic fluxes suggests a quasi-exponential decay of permeability with depth of log k -3.2 log z - 14, where k is in meters squared and z is in kilometers. At mid to lower crustal depths this curve lies just below the threshold value for significant advection of heat. Such conditions may represent an optimum for metamorphism, allowing the maximum transport of fluid and solute mass that is possible without advective cooling.},

abstract = {Abstract A long-term pump test was conducted in the KTB pilot borehole (KTB-VB), located in the Oberpfalz area, Germany. It produced 22 300 m3 of formation fluid. Initially, fluid production rate was 29 l min-1 for 4 months, but was then raised to an average of 57 l min-1 for eight more months. The aim of this study was to examine the fluid parameters and hydraulic properties of fractured, crystalline crusts as part of the new KTB programme 'Energy and Fluid Transport in Continental Fault Systems'. KTB-VB has an open-hole section from 3850 to 4000 m depth that is in hydraulic contact with a prominent continental fault system in the area, called SE2. Salinity and temperature of the fluid inside the borehole, and consequently hydrostatic pressure, changed significantly throughout the test. Influence of these quantities on variations in fluid density had to be taken into account for interpretation of the pump test. Modelling of the pressure response related to the pumping was achieved assuming the validity of linear Darcy flow and permeability to be independent of the flow rate. Following the principle 'minimum in model dimension', we first examined whether the pressure response can be explained by an equivalent model where rock properties around the borehole are axially symmetric. Calculations show that the observed pressure data in KTB-VB can in fact be reproduced through such a configuration. For the period of high pumping rate (57 l min-1) and the following recovery phase, the resulting parameters are 2.4 x 10-13 m3 in hydraulic transmissivity and 3.7 x 10-9 m Pa-1 in storativity for radial distances up to 187 m, and 4.7 x 10-14 m3 and 6.0 x 10-9 m Pa-1, respectively, for radial distances between 187 and 1200 m. The former pair of values mainly reflect the hydraulic properties of the fault zone SE2. For a more realistic hydraulic study on a greater scale, program FEFLOW was used. Parameter values were obtained by matching the calculated induced pressure signal to fluid-level variations observed in the KTB main hole (KTB-HB) located at 200 m radial distance from KTB-VB. KTB-HB is uncased from 9031 to 9100 m and shows indications of leakage in the casing at depths 5200-5600 m. Analysis of the pressure record and hydraulic modelling suggest the existence of a weak hydraulic communication between the two boreholes, probably at depths around the leakage. Hydraulic modelling of a major slug-test in KTB-HB that was run during the pumping in KTB-VB reveals the effective transmissivity of the connected formation to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the one determined for the SE2 fault zone.},

abstract = {Both boreholes of the German Continental Deep Drilling Program encountered a fluid-conducting crust over a 9101 m vertical profile. Low matrix permeability was observed on the laboratory scale (geometric mean value 7×10−20 m2 with something more than one decade standard deviation) and in situ higher values of the order of 5×10−18 to 3×10−16 m2. With respect to the scatter of measured matrix permeability there was no lithology dependence observed, whereas permeability parallel to the foliation (geometric mean value 3×10−19 m2) is significant higher than those perpendicular to the foliation (2×10−20 m2). With increasing depth the in situ permeability varies within a few orders of magnitude, showing, however, no clear depth dependence. The in situ permeability increases over 3 orders of magnitude while the effective pressure decreases by 50 MPa, whereas in contrast, the permeability of laboratory core specimens changes by 1 order of magnitude. The pilot drill hole “Vorboh-rung” and the main drill hole “Hauptbohrung” communicate through a network of conductive fractures at the bottom hole level of the Vorbohrung as well as between both bottom hole sections. The formation pressure increases with a mean gradient of 11.5 Mpa km−1 from surface to 103±3 MPa to 9101 m depth. Overhydrostatic increasing pore pressure and so a strong stress reduction can be excluded as a reason for the low permeability decrease observed at the bottom of the hole. Formation pressure remains hydrostatic with respect to probable increasing salinity.},

annote = {3D stratigraphic geometries of the intracratonic Meso-Cenozoic Paris Basin were obtained by sequence stratigraphic correlations of around 1 100 wells (well-logs). The basin records the major tectonic events of the western part of the Eurasian Plate, i.e. opening and closure of the Tethys and opening of the Atlantic. From earlier Triassic to Late Jurassic, the Paris Basin was a broad subsiding area in an extensional framework, with a larger size than the present-day basin. During the Aalenian time, the subsidence pattern changes drastically (early stage of the central Atlantic opening). Further steps of the opening of the Ligurian Tethys (base Hettangian, late Pliensbachian;...) and its evolution into an oceanic domain (passive margin, Callovian) are equally recorded in the tectono-sedimentary history. The Lower Cretaceous was characterized by NE-SW compressive medium wavelength unconformities (late Cimmerian-Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary and intra-Berriasian and late Aptian unconformities) coeval with opening of the Bay of Biscay. These unconformities are contemporaneous with a major decrease of the subsidence rate. After an extensional period of subsidence (Albian to Turonian), NE-SW compression started in late Turonian time with major folding during the Late Cretaceous. The Tertiary was a period of very low subsidence in a compressional framework. The second folding stage occurred from the Lutetian to the Lower Oligocene (N-S compression) partly coeval with the E-W extension of the Oligocene rifts. Further compression occurred in the early Burdigalian and the Late Miocene in response to NE-SW shortening. Overall uplift occurred, with erosion, around the Lower/Middle Pleistocene boundary.},

abstract = {Mathematical calculations of thermal convection have been carried out using a porous three-player model to simulate pore-water flow in a sedimentary basin with layers of different permeabilities. The calculated flow lines demonstrate that even very thin layers (\textless 1 m) with low permeability, like shales in a more permeable sandstone sequence, will split potentially larger convection cells into smaller units of clean sandstone beds which may then be too small to exceed the critical Rayleigh number. In a situation where we have horizontal isotherms, a sandstone bed with 1 Darcy permeability must have a thickness of more than 330 m without shale interbeds for convection to occur. This situation is rarely met in sedimentary basins. In the case of sloping isotherms, non-Rayleigh convection will always occur but the flow rate is proportional to the effective thickness of the bed and the slope of the isotherms. Calculations suggest that the flow rates are insignificant for diagnetic reactions except in situations where we have steeply sloping isotherms eg, around salt domes and igneous or hydrothermal intrusions. Analyses of formation waters from sedimentary basins like the North Sea often show evidence of a crude stratification of the pore water with respect to salinity and isotopic composition. This is evidence suggesting that large scale convection, or other types of mixing, does not take place and positive salinity depth gradient may help to physically stabilize the formation water. The fact that many of the shallow reservoir rocks from the North Sea have formation water with low salinity and negative [delta] 18O values suggest that this is modified meteoric water and that migration of petroleum from deeper parts of the basin occurred as a separate phase along restricted migration pathways and was not associated with a high flux of pore water. In the absence of thermal convection the total pore water flux through sandstones will be rather small except locally where we may have focused compactional flow through small cross-sections. Diagenetic reactions will, therefore, normally be relatively isochemical during deeper burial.},

abstract = {The lithosphere thickness in the Variscan belt of central Europe varies between about 60 and 150 km with typical values of 100-120 km. Our estimates, derived from directionally independent representative P-wave residuals, are in good agreement with magnetotelluric determinations of a layer with increased conductivity in the upper mantle. The large-scale anisotropies of the subcrustal lithosphere beneath four seismological stations determined from spatial variations of relative P residuals vary between 6.5 and 15.2% for P velocities; the S-wave anisotropies determined from SKS polarizations vary between 2.2 and 6.7%. These values are in reasonable agreement with the anisotropies of peridotites determined in laboratory. Systematic spatial variations of the directional terms of relative residuals in dependence on azimuths and incidence angles suggest the existence of large dipping anisotropic structures in the subcrustal lithosphere. The residual patterns at most stations in the Saxothuringicum, Rhenohercynicum and in the Massif Central imply northwesterly orientated dips of the anisotropic structures while stations in the Moldanubicum, the Alpine Foredeep and most of the Alps north of the Insubric line, suggest southeasterly orientated dips. In our interpretation the dipping anisotropic structures may represent paleosubductions which retain olivine preferred orientations originating from an ancient oceanic lithosphere. The Variscides of central Europe may thus represent a collision zone characterized by two systems of paleosubductions divergent relative to the suture between the Moldanubicum and the Saxothuringicum.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional finite-difference thermal modelling of the major extensional Simplon Fault Zone in the Central Alps establishes that the shape of cooling curves for samples from the footwall and hanging wall at various distances from the detachment are very sensitive to the actual displacement history. If the displacement had occurred within a very limited time span (18-15 Ma), samples from the hanging wall close to the detachment should have significantly increased in temperature, with a peak around 14 Ma. This is not discernible in the cooling curves interpreted from the mineral ages. If the rate of normal fault displacement had been lower but constant from 18 Ma to present, the cooling curves for the footwall should show a correspondingly steady decrease in temperature. The interpreted cooling curves from mineral ages are steep after 18 Ma, becoming shallower in more recent times. This shape can be reproduced by the thermal modelling for a variable rate of fault displacement, initially rapid (total relative displacement 10 mm/a across the fault zone) between 18 and 15 Ma but reducing to a more steady 0.4 mm/a between 15 Ma and 3 Ma. The corresponding exhumation rate of the footwall was 4.6 mm/a from 18 to 15 Ma, and 0.6 mm/a from 15 to 3 Ma, whereas the hanging wall was exhumed at a constant rate of 0.4 mm/a. The difference in cooling curves for samples with increasing horizontal distance into the footwall reflects a distributed ductile shear, with the sample at 20 km distance initially at 25 km depth at 25 Ma, whereas that at 70 m distance was only at 19 km depth. At the same time samples in the hanging wall were at 10 km depth. Total relative displacement parallel to the fault plane was around 36 km. The thermal modelling demonstrates that during rapid fault displacement the "apparent" exhumation rate calculated assuming a constant geothermal gradient is too low, whereas the "apparent" rate calculated for the subsequent period of slower displacement is too high.},

This orogenic belt developed in the Upper Devonian/Carboniferous. Mostly Devonian rocks crop out at the surface. The Rhenish Massif is bordered by two sedimentary troughs: the sub-Variscan Foredeep in the north and the Permo-Carboniferous Saar-Nahe Basin in the south. In the east-west direction it is subdivided by the axial depression of the Eifel Nord-S�d Zone. The aim of the survey which totals almost 220 km of seismic profiling, was to investigate the crustal structure of the western part of the Rhenish Massif and to compare it with the line DEKORP 2-N which crosses the eastern portion of the massif. The results indicate the presence of NW-vergent tectonics of various styles that can often be traced down to deep parts of the crust. Horizontal Variscan compression plays a dominant role in the northern part while post-Variscan extension seems to dominate in the Saar-Nahe Basin, although even there traces of Variscan compression seem to be preserved in the middle crust. Common characteristics of the pre-Palaeozoic basement, differences between the western and eastern parts of the Rhenish Massif, and the deep extension of the Aachen Thrust (Faille du Midi) have been clearly observed.

In all annealed samples the mean confined track length is always less than that in unannealed control samples. As annealing progresses, the mean length is reduced and the length distribution broadens, slowly at first, and then more rapidly below a length reduction (l/l0) of \textasciitilde 0.65. In addition, the variation of track length with angle to the crystallographic c-axis becomes progressively more anisotropic. As the mean track length approaches zero, the only tracks left are aligned parallel to the c-acis. In heavily annealed samples (l/l0 \textless 0.65) observation of individual tracks after sequential etching steps shows the presence of unetchable "gaps" in a small proportion of tracks. The existence of these gaps is borne out by annealing studies of heavy-ion tracks in apatite slices. These studies also show the anisotropy characteristic of annealing in apatite. The annealing of fission tracks in apatite appears to be characterised by two processes. For small degrees of annealing the dominant process brings about a progressive shrinking of the track from each end, with tracks perpendicular to the c-axis shortening more rapidly than those parallel to it. As annealing becomes more severe (l/l0 \textless 0.65) the tracks begin to break up into discontinuous portions. Track length distributions in annealed apatites reflect the interplay of these processes. The effect of apatite composition on annealing has been studied using spontaneous tracks in apatites from a sample in which considerable geological annealing has occurred. Electron microprobe studies show that apatite grains rich in Cl are more resistant to annealing, while fluorapatite is more readily annealed.},

The following five geophysical parameters can be estimated from the method: (1) true formation temperature (Tf); (2) mud temperature (Tm) at the time the mud circulation stops; (3) thermal invasion distance (R) into the formation before the formation is at the true formation temperature(Tf); (4) formation thermal conductivity (K) perpendicular to the borehole; and (5) efficiency factor (F) for heating mud in the borehole after mud circulation has stopped. Crucial input data for the model are the temperature measurements with shut-in time taken at a fixed depth, more than two measurements being required, and the mud temperature at the surface at the time circulation stops. Other input data include the radius of the borehole, and the densities and specific heats of the drilling mud and of the formation on which the temperature measurements are made. Applications of the new inverse procedure to both synthetic data and field data show that the true formation temperature in many cases can be estimated precisely (to within about 0.4 percent); that the mud temperature can be estimated with acceptable accuracy (5 percent or so); while the thermal conductivity (K), the thermal invasion distance (R), and the efficiency factor (F) can be roughly estimated, provided high-quality data are available.},

Through their concomitant changes of the intra-plate tectonic stress regime, inter-plate motions induced intra-plate tectonism and magmatism. These plate-tectonics related events determined the tectonomagmatic history of the Dutch realm by inducing the formation of localized centres, as well as isolated spot occurrences, of igneous activity. Some of these centres were active at (about) the same time. At a number of centres igneous activity re-occurred after a long period of time.},

abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid explusion from geopressured sediments using a one-dimensional finite difference model shows that large volumes of fluid can be transported through a fractured seal during short-lived (\textless100 year) expulsion events. In this model, abnormal fluid pressures are maintained by an impermeable seal. When the fluid pressure exceeds 85% of the lithostatic pressure, a vertical fracture opens in the seal, providing a permeable pathway from the geopressured sediments into the overlying section. Fluid pressure in the seal decreases as fluid flows through the fracture, closing the fracture as sediments in the seal compact. Once the fracture closes, the seal remains impermeable until fluid flowing from deeper in the section increases fluid pressure to the fracture criteria, a process that takes 10 000-500 000 years. Fractures emplaced in relatively incompressible seals, such as compacted and/or cemented sediments, remain open for 20-50 years; fluid fluxes through the seal integrated over the life of these events are 1-5×107 kg/m2, and temperatures in the overlying sediments are increased by 5-20°C. These temperature anomalies decay to less than half their original value in 300 years, suggesting that the thermal anomalies observed in wells that are attributed to fluid expulsion formed in response to a very recent or currently active event.},

abstract = {The rise of fluid pressure along a fault plane can trigger an earthquake as shear strength decreases. Recent models have thus suggested that the rate of interseismic fluid-pressure increase may control earthquake recurrence. In electric-analog model simulations incorporating new experimental data on rock properties within the lower seismogenic zone, resultant fluid-pressure fluctuations are restricted to the fault plane, and are strongly attenuated during their slow propagation into the country rock. Fluid-pressure drops, triggered by coseismic fault dilation, require days to hundreds of years to propagate over distances ≥1 m into low-permeability country rock (≤10 m). The equilibration of fluid pressure between the faulted and the intact country rock requires tens to hundreds of years. If the fault seals prior to this equilibration, the fluid pressure recovers instantaneously to near the prefailure value. These results may imply that if elevated fluid pressure weakens transcrustal fault zones, they are likely to remain weak after earthquakes.},

abstract = {A high-resolution, regional passive seismic experiment in the Rio Grande rift region of the southwestern United States has produced new images of upper-mantle velocity structure and crust-mantle topography. Synthesizing these results with geochemical and other geophysical evidence reveals highly symmetric lower-crustal and upper-mantle lithosphere extensional deformation, suggesting a pure-shear rifting mechanism for the Rio Grande rift. Extension in the lower crust is distributed over a region four times the width of the rift's surface expression. Here we propose that the laterally distributed, pure shear extension is a combined effect of low strain rate and a regionally elevated geotherm, possibly abetted by pre-existing lithospheric structures, at the time of rift initiation. Distributed extension in the lower crust and mantle has induced less concentrated vertical mantle upwelling and less vigorous small-scale convection than would have arisen from more localized deformation. This lack of highly focused mantle upwelling may explain a deficit of rift-related volcanics in the Rio Grande rift compared to other major rift systems such as the Kenya rift.},

@article{Pedersen1994,
abstract = {Abstract Open fractures provide high-permeability pathways for fluid flow in sedimentary basins. The potential for flow along permeable or open fractures and faults depends on the continuity of flow all the way to the surface except in the case of convective flow. Upward flowing fluid cools and may cause cementation due to the prograde solubility of quartz, but in the case of carbonates such flow may cause dissolution. The rate and duration of these processes depend on the mechanisms for sustaining fluid flow into the fracture, the geometries of fracture and sedimentary beds intersected, permeability, pressure and temperature gradients. Heat loss to the adjacent sediments causes sloping isotherms which can induce non-Rayleigh convection. To analyse these problems we have used a simple model in which a single fracture acts as a pathway for vertically moving fluid and there is no fluid transport across the walls of the fracture except near its inlet and outlet. Four mechanisms for fluid flow into the lower part of the fracture are considered: decompression of pore water; compaction of intersected overpressared sediments; focusing of compaction water derived from sediments beneath the fracture; and finally focusing of pore water moving through an aquifer. Water derived from the basement is not considered here. We find that sustained flow is unlikely to have velocities much higher than 1-100 m/yr, and the flow is laminar. The temperature of the fluid expelled at the top of the fracture increases by less than 1% and the vertical temperature gradient in the fracture remains close to the geothermal gradient. Where hot water is introduced from basement fractures (hydrothermal water) during tectonic deformation, much higher velocities may be sustained in the overlying sediments, but here also this depends on the permeability near the surface. Most of the cooling of water with (ore) mineral precipitation will then occur near the surface. In most cases, pore water decompression and sediment compaction will yield only very limited pore water flux with no significant potential for cementation or heating of the sediments adjacent to the fracture. Focusing of compaction water from sediments beneath the fracture or from an intersected aquifer can yield fluxes high enough to cement an open fracture significantly but the flow must be sustained for a very long time. For velocities of 1-100 m/yr, it takes typically 0.3-30 Myr to cement a fracture by 50%. The highest velocities may be obtained when a fracture extends all the way to the surface or sea floor. When a fracture does not reach the sediment surface, the flow velocity is reduced by the displacement of water in the sediments near the top of the fracture. The flow into the fracture from the sediments may often be rate limiting rather than the flow on the fracture. Sedimentary rocks only a few metres from the fracture will receive a much lower flux than the fracture. The fracture will therefore close due to cementation before significant amounts of silica can be introduced into adjacent sandstones. The isotherm slope in the adjacent sediments will in most cases be less than 10-20o. Non-Rayleigh convection velocities in the sediments adjacent to the fracture are too small to cause any significant diagenetic reactions such as quartz cementation. These quantifications of fluid flow in fractures in sedimentary basins are important in terms of constraining models for diagenesis, heat transport and formation of ore minerals in a compaction-driven system.},

It is suggested that this uplift pattern has resulted from thickening of the continental crust caused by flow in the lower crust which has been induced by cyclic surface loading caused by growth and decay of ice sheets and the associated global sea-level fluctuations. Observed uplift histories are modelled using a technique which incorporates increases in the strength of forcing of this process caused by step changes in the intensity of glaciations starting at 3.1, 2.5, 1.2, and 0.9 Ma.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) observations are generally influenced by drilling-induced thermal disturbances which must be corrected for. This paper presents a correction method based on a 1-D conductive finite element model and an inverse procedure for parameter estimation. While the technique may be applied to any section of the borehole this paper focuses on the correction of bottom hole temperatures. Model parameters are mud temperature during drilling and circulation at the depth of BHT observations, borehole radius, thermal parameters of mud and formation, and the equilibrium formation temperature. Data are one or more successive BHTs and their standard deviations. Prior to inversion the model parameters are assigned reasonable values and standard deviations that reflect the confidence in those values. A high level of confidence implies small standard deviations and vice versa. The process of inversion extracts the most likely values of all free parameters including the equilibrium formation temperature. Furthermore, the initial uncertainties in all parameters and data are propagated into uncertainties in the final parameter estimates. The formation temperature estimate is an unbiased estimate of the true formation temperature when the a priori parameter estimates and their standard deviations are consistent with the actual physical conditions in the borehole and the formation. The method on average yields 5-10 per cent higher equilibrium temperature estimates than does the Horner plot method and displays a strong consistency with temperature obtained during production tests. This is of importance to the understanding of terrestrial heat flow density patterns, and thermal structure of sedimentary basins, and to the modelling of hydrocarbon generation. The theory and results from the processing of 41 BHT series from 27 industrial wells in the North Sea Central Graben are presented.},

@article{Toth2001,
abstract = {The 2248 40 000 km2 Hungarian Great Plain portion of the Pannonian Basin consists of a basin fill of 100 m to more than 7000 m thick semi- to unconsolidated marine, deltaic, lacustrine and fluviatile clastic sediments of Neogene age, resting on a strongly tectonized Pre-Neogene basement of horst-and-graben topography of a relief in excess of 5000 m. The basement is built of a great variety of brittle rocks, including flysch, carbonates and metamorphics. The relatively continuous Endr0151d Aquitard, with a permeability of less than 1 md (10221215 m2) and a depth varying between 500 and 5000 m, divides the basin's rock framework into upper and lower sequences of highly permeable rock units, whose permeabilities range from a few tens to several thousands of millidarcy. Subsurface fluid potential and flow fields were inferred from 16 192 water level and pore pressure measurements using three methods of representation: pressure2013elevation profiles; hydraulic head maps; and hydraulic cross-sections. Pressure2013elevation profiles were constructed for eight areas. Typically, they start from the surface with a straight-line segment of a hydrostatic gradient (03B3st = 9.8067 MPa km22121) and extend to depths of 140020132500 m. At high surface elevations, the gradient is slightly smaller than hydrostatic, while at low elevations it is slightly greater. At greater depths, both the pressures and their vertical gradients are uniformly superhydrostatic. The transition to the overpressured depths may be gradual, with a gradient of 03B3dyn = 10201315 MPa km22121 over a vertical distance of 40020131000 m, or abrupt, with a pressure jump of up to 10 MPa km22121 over less than 100 m and a gradient of 03B3dyn > 20 MPa km22121. According to the hydraulic head maps for 13 1002013500 m thick horizontal slices of the rock framework, the fluid potential in the near-surface domains declines with depth beneath positive topographic features, but it increases beneath depressions. The approximate boundary between these hydraulically contrasting regions is the 100 m elevation contour line in the Duna2013Tisza interfluve, and the 1002013110 m contours in the Ny{\'{i}}rs{\'{e}}g uplands. Below depths of 2248 600 m, islets of superhydrostatic heads develop which grow in number, areal extent and height as the depth increases; hydraulic heads may exceed 3000 m locally. A hydraulic head 'escarpment' appears gradually in the elevation range of 2212 1000 to 2212 2800 m along an arcuate line which tracks a major regional fault zone striking NE2013SW: heads drop stepwise by several hundred metres, at places 2000 m, from its north and west sides to the south and east. The escarpment forms a 'fluid potential bank' between a 'fluid potential highland' (50020132500 m) to the north and west, and a 'fluid potential basin' (1002013500 m) to the south and east. A 'potential island' rises 1000 m high above this basin further south. According to four vertical hydraulic sections, groundwater flow is controlled by the topography in the upper 20020131700 m of the basin; the driving force is orientated downwards beneath the highlands and upwards beneath the lowlands. However, it is directed uniformly upwards at greater depths. The transition between the two regimes may be gradual or abrupt, as indicated by wide or dense spacing of the hydraulic head contours, respectively. Pressure 'plumes' or 'ridges' may protrude to shallow depths along faults originating in the basement. The basement horsts appear to be overpressured relative to the intervening grabens. The principal thesis of this paper is that the two main driving forces of fluid flow in the basin are gravitation, due to elevation differences of the topographic relief, and tectonic compression. The flow field is unconfined in the gravitational regime, whereas it is confined in the compressional regime. The nature and geometry of the fluid potential field between the two regimes are controlled by the sedimentary and structural features of the rock units in that domain, characterized by highly permeable and localized sedimentary windows, conductive faults and fracture zones. The transition between the two potential fields can be gradual or abrupt in the vertical, and island-like or ridge-like in plan view. The depth of the boundary zone can vary between 400 and 2000 m. Recharge to the gravitational regime is inferred to occur from infiltrating precipitation water, whereas that to the confined regime is from pore volume reduction due to the basement's tectonic compression.},

abstract = {We present a new estimate of the Earth's heat loss based on a new global compilation of heat flow measurements comprising 24,774 observations at 20,201 sites. On a 5° × 5° grid, the observations cover 62% of the Earth's surface. Empirical estimators, referenced to geological map units and derived from the observations, enable heat flow to be estimated in areas without measurements. Corrections for the effects of hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust compensate for the advected heat undetected in measurements of the conductive heat flux. The mean heat flows of continents and oceans are 65 and 101 mW m−2, respectively, which when areally weighted yield a global mean of 87 mW m−2 and a global heat loss of 44.2 × 1012 W, an increase of some 4-8% over earlier estimates. More than half of the Earth's heat loss comes from Cenozoic oceanic lithosphere. A spherical harmonic analysis of the global heat flow field reveals strong sectoral components and lesser zonal strength. The spectrum principally reflects the geographic distribution of the ocean ridge system. The rate at which the heat flow spectrum loses strength with increasing harmonic degree is similar to the decline in spectral strength exhibited by the Earth's topography. The spectra of the gravitational and magnetic fields fall off much more steeply, consistent with field sources in the lower mantle and core, respectively. Families of continental and oceanic conductive geotherms indicate the range of temperatures existing in the lithosphere under various surface heat flow conditions. The heat flow field is very well correlated with the seismic shear wave velocity distribution near the top of the upper mantle.},

According to the modelling results of the Early Jurassic oil system, the oil accumulations were filled just after the main inversion event.

Results of modelling of the Lower Namurian oil system indicate that gas formed by secondary cracking of the oils can have mixed with the Westphalian coal-derived gas. Such a mixing is inferred from geochemical analyses.

Several methods have been developed for determination of virgin rock temperatures from maximum temperatures recorded during logging in the past decades. This paper describes an investigation where the calculated virgin rock temperatures from several different methods were examined for bias and accuracy using 18 different measurement series at the Oseberg field. The temperatures were corrected for different depths of burial, and then compared with each other and with drill stem test (DST) measurements to investigate the inaccuracy of the methods. The most advanced methods gave values close to the DST temperatures on average, but with standard deviations as high as 9° C. The less advanced models (like the Horner plot method) have systematically too low virgin rock temperatures (by about 8° C) for the Oseberg field, with standard deviations of 8° C. The errors in calculated virgin rock temperatures are large enough to completely alter predictions of hydrocarbon generation in an area. The large errors are attributed to poor quality data and to physical effects that are not properly taken into account in the temperature calculations. Improved sampling of temperature data can probably reduce the errors to some extent.},

In developing countries, limited budgets and scarce hydrological data often do not allow groundwater resources to be assessed through groundwater modeling. A case study is presented of a low-cost water-balance approach to groundwater resource assessments in a 1,550 km2 semi-arid region in northwestern Syria. The past development of irrigated agriculture and its effect on the groundwater system were studied by analysis of Landsat images and long-term groundwater level changes, respectively. All components of the groundwater balance were determined. Groundwater recharge was estimated using the chloride mass balance method. Over the past three decades, groundwater levels have declined, on average, 23 m, coinciding with a two-fold increase in the groundwater-irrigated area. Groundwater resources are currently depleted by a value that lies between 9.5×106 and 118×106 m3 year−1, which is larger than can be compensated for by a future decrease in natural discharge or changes in boundary conditions. However, groundwater resources are likely to be sufficient to supply domestic and livestock needs in the area.},

abstract = {The whole of the Western Alpine realm can be considered to result from the inversion of the European margin of Ligurian Tethys as a consequence of the collision between Apulia and Europe. The margin was developed due to Tethyan rifting during the Liassic and Middle Jurassic and regional thermal subsidence as the Ligurian ocean was spreading in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Coevally, the margin underwent additional stretching in response to North Atlantic rifting. Inversion was initiated by Late Cretaceous times when the Ligurian oceanic crust began to be subducted, with localized obduction, beneath the previously passive margin. The most recent inversion of the Western Alps occurred in the external Molasse basin of Manosque-Digne-Valensole during the Late Miocene and Pliocene. Regions of mild inversion allow useful comparisons to be made with more strongly inverted basins. The geometric characteristics of the inverted basins depend on the lithology, geometry of the extensional structures, orientation of extensional faults with respect to the compressive Alpine stresses and the amount of compression. Comparisons of the external and interal zones suggest that the ductilely deformed thrust sheets may have originated from inverted half-grabens.},

abstract = {The inversion of crustal-scale basement grabens is studied here through laboratory experiments on small-scale models and available oil industry seismic lines from the southern North Sea. Two basic configurations are considered. First, both the basement and the sedimentary cover are brittle, and inversion does not involve any potential d{\'{e}}collement between them. Second, the basement and sedimentary cover are separated by a weak ductile layer (e.g., salt), which can allow d{\'{e}}collement of the cover during both extension and later compression and inversion. The second configuration is more complicated and can lead to a large variety of geological structures. Laboratory experiments were carried out on brittle-ductile models built with sand to represent brittle layers (basement and sedimentary cover) and silicone putty to simulate the d{\'{e}}collement layer between basement and cover. A mechanically based classification of inversion structures is proposed. The effects of some crucial parameters are investigated, including obliquity between the direction of shortening and normal faults, as well as strength profiles, and the presence or absence of salt diapirs. The experimental investigation leads to the following conclusions: (1) the inversion of the graben by reactivation of normal faults implies that the angle between the direction of compression and the graben is less than 45°, (2) if there is a superficial d{\'{e}}collement (e.g., basement-cover interface), inversion initiates low dipping thrust faults in the cover, localized at graben borders, (3) salt diapirs or salt walls localized along the graben borders in the cover are preferential sites for the development of thrust faults, and (4) when the cover is decoupled from the basement by a d{\'{e}}collement layer, inversion induced deformation in the cover which is partitioned between thrust faults along the graben borders and strike-slip faults within the graben trending oblique to the graben borders. Experimental results are compared with field examples, in particular from the southern North Sea.},

@article{Bertotti1997,
abstract = {We have reconstructed the kinematic, thermal and rheological evolution of the Triassic-Cretaceous South Alpine passive continental margin (Northern Italy) and estimated lateral strength variations associated with rifting. Rifting initially caused the formation of a roughly symmetrical, ca. 100 km wide graben located 150-200 km away from the future break-up site. 30 Myr after the onset of rifting, the rift axis shifted laterally and eventually led to oceanic crust formation. The thermal evolution of the margin was first controlled by the waning of a thermal anomaly, which was emplaced shortly before rifting and was cooling during the first extensional stages. Numerical modelling of rifting and drifting, constrained by field data, is used to trace thermal and rheological changes affecting the rifted margin. The effects of the thermal anomaly are restricted to the first 10-20 Myr of rifting. Subsequently, isotherms are slightly affected by lithospheric thinning and show very little distortion after break-up. Rheological modelling demonstrates that the South Alpine lithosphere preserved substantial strength even shortly before break-up and became stronger thereafter. The modelling also shows that, at break-up and 100 Myr later, thinned domains of the margin are stronger than the less thinned ones.},

abstract = {Abstract   Late Carboniferous (300–290 Ma) calc-alkaline basalts, andesites, and rhyolites typical of volcanic arc settings occur in
the intermontane Saar-Nahe basin (SW Germany) within the Variscan orogenic belt. The volcanic rock suite was emplaced under
a regime of tensional tectonics during orogenic collapse and its origin has been explained by melting of mantle and crust
in the course of limited lithospheric rifting. We report major, trace and rare-earth-element data (REE), and Nd-Pb-Sr-O isotope
ratios for a representative sample suite, which are fully consistent with an origin closely related to plate subduction. Major
and trace element data define continuous melt differentiation trends from a precursor basaltic magma involving fractional
crystallization of olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite typical of magma evolution in a volcanic arc. This finding
precludes an origin of the andesitic compositions by mixing of mafic and felsic melts as can be expected in anorogenic settings.
The mafic samples have high Mg numbers (Mg# = 65–73), and high Cr (up to 330 ppm) and Ni (up to 200 ppm) contents indicating
derivation from a primitive parental melt that was formed in equilibrium with mantle peridotite. We interpret the geochemical
characteristics of the near-primary basalts as reflecting their mantle source. The volcanic rocks are characterized by enrichment
in the large ion lithophile elements (LILE), negative Nb and Ti, and positive Pb anomalies relative to the neighboring REE,
suggesting melting of a subduction-modified mantle. Initial Nd values of −0.7 to −4.6, Pb, and 87Sr/86Sr(t) isotope ratios for mafic and felsic volcanics are similar and indicate partial melting of an isotopically heterogeneous and
enriched mantle reservoir. The enrichment in incompatible trace elements and radiogenic isotopes of a precursor depleted mantle
may be attributed to addition of an old sedimentary component. The geochemical characteristics of the Saar-Nahe volcanic rocks
are distinct from typical post-collisional rock suites and they may be interpreted as geochemical evidence for ongoing plate
subduction at the margin of the Variscan orogenic belt not obvious from the regional geologic context.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track analyses were carried out on outcrop and core samples from the Rhenish massif and the Carboniferous Ruhr Basin/Germany in order to study the late- and post-Variscan thermal and exhumation history. Apatite fission-track ages range from 291±15 Ma (lower Permian) to 136±7 Ma (lower Cretaceous) and mean track lengths vary between 11.6 µm and 13.9 µm, mostly displaying unimodal distributions with narrow standard deviations. All apatite fission-track ages are younger than the corresponding sample stratigraphic age, indicating substantial post-depositional annealing of the apatite fission-tracks. This agrees with results from maturity modelling, which indicates 3500–7000 m eroded Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary cover. Numerical modelling of apatite fission-track data predicts onset of exhumation and cooling not earlier than 320 Ma in the Rhenish massif and 300 Ma in the Ruhr Basin, generally followed by late Carboniferous–Triassic cooling to below 50–60°C. Rapid late Variscan cooling was followed by moderate Mesozoic cooling rates of 0.1–0.2°C/Ma, converting into denudation rates of \textless1 mm/a (assuming a stable geothermal gradient of 30°C/km). Modelling results also give evidence for some late Triassic and early Jurassic heating and/or burial, which is supported by sedimentary rocks of the same age preserved at the rim of the lower Rhine Basin and in the subsurface of the Central and Northern Ruhr Basin. Cenozoic exhumation and cooling of the Rhenish massif is interpreted as an isostatic response to former erosion and major base-level fall caused by the subsidence in the lower Rhine Basin.},

abstract = {An 11-meter-wide alkalic monchiquite dike recovered from the subsurface of Louisiana has produced a metasomatic aureole in the adjacent interbedded carbonate mudstones and siltstones. The asymmetric contact aureole, which extends nearly 6 m above and 4 m below the intrusion, contains the metamorphic minerals, diopside, pectolite, fluor-apophyllite, fluorite, and garnet. A series of coupled heat and mass transport calculations was undertaken to provide thermal constraints for the aureole, in the absence of robust geothermometric assemblages, and insights into accompanying mass transport associated with the sedimentary rock-dike system. Calculations were completed for systems with homogeneous, anisotropic, and layered permeability, [kappa]. Transport, dissolution, and precipitation of silica were also incorporated into calculations. All systems modeled indicate that the thermal pulse waned in 3 yr with a return to background temperatures in 10 yr. Heat and fluid transport produce maximum temperature isotherms that are distinctly different in spatial extent and lateral variability for each numerical system. The homogeneous [kappa] case produced isotherms that pinch and swell vertically above the dike and have large lateral variations, in contrast to the anisotropic [kappa] case that produced a single large plume above the dike. The layered system [kappa] case produced the most spatially extensive thermal aureole, unlike that recorded in the rocks. Addition of dissolved silica to the flow system significantly impacts the calculated transport of heat and fluid, primarily due to density changes that affect upwelling dynamics. Although precipitation and dissolution of SiO2 can affect flow through the feedback to permeability, [kappa] changes were found to be minor for these system conditions. Where [kappa] decreased, flow was refocused into higher [kappa] zones, thus mitigating the [kappa] differences over time. This negative feedback tends to defocus flow and provides a mechanism for lateral migration of plumes. Coupled heat and silica transport produces a complex isotherm geometry surrounding the intrusion due to formation of upwelling and downwelling plumes and lateral translation of plumes, leading to variability in the isotherm pattern that does not reflect the inherent heterogeneity of the initial material properties. Initial heterogeneities in [kappa] are not a prerequisite for the development of a complicated flow and transport pattern. In addition, if isotherms reflect isograds, these calculations demonstrate that isograds may not form uniform structures with isograd boundaries characterized by their distance from the heat source.},

abstract = {Extensive calcite fault cement has resulted from leakage of Santa Barbara basin fluids and hydrocarbons into the Refugio-Carneros fault, a north-bounding structure to the basin. Calcite cements are only found at the end segments of the 24-km (15-mi)-long fault zone, which has less than 150 m (490 ft) of maximum normal offset. The calcite is contemporaneous with fault movement, as evidenced by pervasive crystal twinning and brecciation, as well as textures indicating repeated episodes of rapid fluid flow and calcite cementation. Based on U-Th dates of the calcite, fluid flow along the fault occurred between 110 and greater than 500 ka, indicating that fluid migration was intermittently active during the recent uplift history of the basin flank. Stable carbon isotopic values of the calcite are {delta}13CPDB = -35 to -41{per thousand}, which means that the carbon source is predominantly thermogenic methane. The composition of fluid inclusions in calcite is consistent with mixing of meteoric and saline water in the presence of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. Fluid-inclusion homogenization temperatures of about 80-95{degrees}C suggest that hot water leaked from 2- to 3-km (1.2- to 1.9-mi) depths in the basin and moved up faults on the basin flank at rates rapid enough to transport substantial heat to shallow depths. Finite-element models show that, in this case, this process requires faulting of an overpressured basin and that a single flow event would have lasted for at least 103 yr.  Subsurface fluid pressures at comparable depths in the offshore section today are close to hydrostatic, and therefore, only slow hydrocarbon seepage occurs. When combined with the U-Th age data, this suggests that over a 105-yr timescale, basin fluid flow has evolved from the rapid expulsion of hot water and gas being carried up along active, bounding faults derived from overpressured strata to present hydrostatic conditions of slow, buoyancy-driven seepage of hydrocarbons.},

The relationships between deformation mechanisms along fault zones and their impact on the hydrogeological structure of the fault zone are analyzed in a shallow (0–5 m below land surface) trench over one of the faults in the study area. Recently developed digital-image-analysis techniques are used to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity at the millimeter-scale and to describe the micromorphologic characteristics of the fault zone. In addition, laboratory measurements of hydraulic conductivity on core-plug samples show the larger-scale distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the damage zone flanking the main fault plane. Particulate flow is the deformation mechanism at shallow depths, which causes the damage zone around the fault, in the sand-rich parts, to have a relatively enhanced hydraulic conductivity. The fault core is characterized by reduced hydraulic conductivity due to clay smearing, grain-scale mixing, and iron-oxide precipitation.},

abstract = {There is now general agreement that many sedimentary basins on the northwest continental shelf of Europe underwent permanent exhumation during the Tertiary. The most dramatic indicator of this process is the present-day absence of up to 3 km of anticipated post-rift subsidence in the midlands of Britain and in the East Irish Sea. Any explanation must take into account the fact that the entire shelf has very small, long wavelength, free-air gravity anomalies. This constraint is of fundamental importance and implies either that the crust has been thickened, that phase changes have occurred within the lithosphere, or that low density material has been added to the lithosphere. Tertiary epeirogenic uplift and exhumation is often attributed to horizontal shortening which is assumed to be related in a general sense to Alpine mountain building. However, the removal of 3 km of sediment from a basin, which was originally 100 km wide, requires 20-30 km of shortening. Whilst minor Tertiary shortening is observed all over the continental shelf, nowhere is it sufficient to account for the inferred amount of denudation. More significantly, exhumation is thought to have commenced in the Early Tertiary and dramatically increases from south to north. Shortening is generally younger (mid-Tertiary) and decreases in intensity from south to north. Here we argue that Tertiary uplift and denudation are a consequence of regional igneous underplating. At the beginning of the Tertiary, rifting associated with the initiation of the Iceland plume generated substantial volumes of melt. Petrological arguments and the results from inversion of rare earth element concentrations of MgO-rich igneous rocks suggest that a minimum of 2-5 km of melt were produced beneath a substantial part of the continental shelf. We infer that much of this melt was trapped within the lithosphere, presumably close to the Moho, which would have acted as a density filter. Such underplating will have caused rapid surface uplift whilst maintaining isostatic equilibrium. Simple calculations based on deep seismic reflection data and the high P-wave velocities observed beneath Scotland are consistent with the petrological arguments.},

Synthesizing these results with geochemical and other geophysical evidence reveals highly symmetric lower-crustal and upper-mantle lithosphere extensional deformation, suggesting a pure-shear rifting mechanism for the Rio Grande rift. Extension in the lower crust is distributed over a region four times the width of the rift's surface expression. Here we propose that the laterally distributed, pure shear extension is a combined effect of low strain rate and a regionally elevated geotherm, possibly abetted by pre-existing lithospheric structures, at the time of rift initiation. Distributed extension in the lower crust and mantle has induced less concentrated vertical mantle upwelling and less vigorous small-scale convection than would have arisen from more localized deformation. This lack of highly focused mantle upwelling may explain a deficit of rift-related volcanics in the Rio Grande rift compared to other major rift systems such as the Kenya rift.},

abstract = {AFTSolve is a computer program for deriving thermal history information from apatite fission-track data. It implements a new fission-track annealing model that takes into account the known kinetic variability among different apatite species. To fully utilize this model, a fission-track worker must obtain data that can be used to infer the kinetic characteristics of each apatite grain from which a measurement was taken. Such data can consist of etch figure lengths or chemical composition. The benefit of this overall approach is that it allows useful information to be derived from previously unusable analyses, extends the practical range of geological temperatures constrained by fission-track analyses, and increases overall confidence in model predictions. AFTSolve also incorporates the effects of fission-track orientation relative to the apatite crystallographic c-axis, variation in initial track length, and the biasing effect of 252Cf irradiation for enhancing confined horizontal track length detection. AFTSolve is written for Windows operating systems, and has a graphical interface that allows interactive input of thermal histories and real-time generation of estimates for fission-track length distributions and ages for up to six simultaneously modeled kinetic populations. It also includes procedures for estimating the range of time-temperature histories that are statistically consistent with a data set and constraints entered by the user.},

abstract = {Sandstone rheology and deformation style are often controlled by the extent of quartz cementation, which is a function of temperature history. Coupling findings from deformation experiments with a model for quartz cementation provide valuable insights into the controls on fault permeability. Subsiding sedimentary basins often have a transitional depth zone, here referred to as the ductile-to-brittle transition, above which faults do not affect fluid flow or form barriers and below which faults will tend to form conduits. The depth of this transition is partly dependent upon geothermal gradient. In basins with a high geothermal gradient, fault-related conduits can form at shallow depths in high-porosity sandstone. If geothermal gradients are low, and fluid pressures are hydrostatic, fault-related conduits are only formed when the sandstones have subsided much deeper, where their porosity (and hence fluid content) is low. Mineralization of faults is more likely to occur in areas with high geothermal gradients because the rocks still have a high fluid content when fault-related fluid-flow conduits form. The interrelationship between rock rheology and stress conditions is sometimes a more important control on fault permeability than whether the fault is active or inactive.},

abstract = {A critical review of dispersivity observations from 59 different field sites was developed by compiling extensive tabulations of information on aquifer type, hydraulic properties, flow configuration, type of monitoring network, tracer, method of data interpretation, overall scale of observation and longitudinal, horizontal transverse and vertical transverse dispersivities from original sources. This information was then used to classify the dispersivity data into three reliability classes. Overall, the data indicate a trend of systematic increase of the longitudinal dispersivity with observation scale but the trend is much less clear when the reliability of the data is considered. The longitudinal dispersivities ranged from 10-2 to 104 m for scales ranging from 10-1 to 105 m, but the largest scale for high reliability data was only 250 m. When the data are classified according to porous versus fractured media there does not appear to be any significant difference between these aquifer types. At a given scale, the longitudinal dispersivity values are found to range over 2-3 orders of magnitude and the higher reliability data tend to fall in the lower portion of this range. It is not appropriate to represent the longitudinal dispersivity data by a single universal line. The variations in dispersivity reflect the influence of differing degrees of aquifer heterogeneity at different sites. The data on transverse dispersivities are more limited but clearly indicate that vertical transverse dispersivities are typically an order of magnitude smaller than horizontal transverse dispersivities. Reanalyses of data from several of the field sites show that improved interpretations most often lead to smaller dispersivities. Overall, it is concluded that longitudinal dispersivities in the lower part of the indicated range are more likely to be realistic for field applications.},

annote = { A methodology is presented for the prediction of fission-track parameters in geological situations from a laboratory-based description of annealing kinetics. To test the validity of extrapolation from laboratory to geological timescales, the approach is applied to a number of geological situations for which apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA) data are available and where thermal history is known with some confidence. Predicted fission-track parameters agree well with observation in all cases, giving confidence in the validity of the extrapolation, and suggesting that fission-track annealing takes place by a single pathway in both laboratory and geological conditions. The precision of predicted track lengths is considered in some detail. Typical levels of precision are \textasciitilde �0.5 [mu]m for mean lengths [precedes, approximate] 10 [mu]m, and \textasciitilde �0.3 [mu]m for length [greater, approximate] 10 [mu]m. Precision is largely independent of thermal history for any reasonable geological thermal history. Accuracy of prediction is limited principally by the effect of apatite composition on annealing kinetics. The development of fission-track parameters is illustrated through a series of notional thermal histories to emphasise various key aspects of the response of the system. Temperature dominates over time in determining final fission-track parameters, with an order of magnitude increase in time being equivalent to a \textasciitilde 10�C increase in temperature. The final length of a track is determined predominantly by the maximum temperature to which it is subjected. Aspects of AFTA response are further highlighted by prediction of patterns of AFTA parameters as a function of depth and temperature from a series of notional burial histories embodying a variety of thermal history styles. The quantitative understanding of AFTA response not only affords the basis of rigorous paleotemperature estimation, but also allows a better understanding of the situations in which AFTA can be applied to yield useful information.},

abstract = {A considerable body of evidence indicates that many of the extensional sedimentary basins in the vicinity of the British Isles underwent permanent exhumation during the Tertiary. The most dramatic indicator of this process is the present-day absence of as much as 4 km of anticipated postrift thermal subsidence in basins just north and west of Scotland. Any explanation of this observation must take into account the fact that the entire region has very small,-long-wavelength, free-air gravity anomalies. This important constraint implies either that the crust has been thickened or that low-density material has been added to or formed from the lithosphere and rules out models that invoke flexural effects arising from the opening of the North Atlantic. Tertiary epeirogeny is often attributed to compression that is assumed to be related in a general sense to Alpine mountain building. However, to remove [ ]3 km of sedi- mentary rock from a basin [ ]100 km wide requires >15 km of shortening. Minor Tertiary compression is observed all over the continental shelf, but nowhere is it sufficient to account for the required amount of uplift and erosion. In addition, exhumation dramatically increases from south to north, whereas the observed compression decreases markedly in the same direction. At the beginning of the Tertiary, rifting associated with the initiation of the Iceland plume generated substantial volumes of melt. Inversion of rare-earth- element concentrations of MgOrich igneous rocks suggests that a minimum of [ ]5 km of melt was produced beneath at least part of the continental shelf. We infer that much of this melt remains trapped within the lithosphere, presumably close to the Moho, which acted as a density filter. Such underplating will generate rapid uplift.},

@article{Houtgast2000,
abstract = {The Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) is located in the southern part of the Netherlands and adjacent parts of Gemany and Belgium. The last rifting episode of the RVRS started in the Late Oligocene and is still ongoing. The present-day seismic activity in the rift system is part of that last rifting episode. In this paper, the Quaternary tectonics of the RVRS are studied using the detailed stratigraphic record. Subsidence analyses show that three periods of subsidence can be discriminated during the Quaternary. A phase of rapid subsidence took place from the beginning of the Quaternary to the Upper Tiglian ( 1800 ka). This was followed by a phase of slow subsidence lasting until the Late Quaternary ( 500 ka). An acceleration in subsidence at the end of the Quaternary occurred in the central and northern parts of the RVRS (i.e. the Roer Valley Graben and the Peel Horst) during the last 500 ka. During the Quaternary, the most active fault zones in the RVRS are the Peel Boundary Fault zone and the Feldbiss Fault zone. Average displacements along these fault zones vary between 5 and 80 mm/ka. Periods of high and low displacement rates along faults can be discriminated. The magnitude of the subsidence rate in the central part of the RVRS, which in theory is caused by a combination of processes like faulting, cooling of the lithosphere and isostasy, is within the range of the rate of displacement along the major fault zones of the RVRS, which implies that the subsidence of the RVRS is to a large extent controlled by faulting. Along the wide and staggered Feldbiss Fault zone, the location of the largest displacement rate shifts during the Quaternary, whereas the Peel Boundary Fault zone, which is narrow and has a straight structure, is more stable in this respect. The present-day fault displacement rates inferred by geodetic measurements are two orders of magnitude larger than the rates inferred from the geological record. Such a large difference can be explained by a high variability of fault movements on a short time-scale due to fault-stress interactions. The stratigraphic record has preserved average displacement rates. Flexural analyses shows that the pattern of geodetically determined displacements is in accordance with the fault spacing in the fault zone. The NW-SE directed fault system active during the Quaternary and the Tertiary is inherited from the late stage of the Variscan orogeny. This fault system was also dominantly active during the Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic evolution of the RVRS. Lineament analysis of the topography indicates that apart from the dominant NW-SE-oriented faults, N-S and NE-SW directed faults are also prominent. These faults originate from the Caledonian tectonic phases. They have, however, no large displacements during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The fact that Paleozoic fault systems are reactivated during Quaternary and Tertiary indicates that these faults are fundamental weakness zones.},

abstract = {A method is presented that permits the length of any horizontal, confined fission-track inclined at a specified angle to the crystallographic c axis in apatite to be converted to an equivalent track length parallel to the crystallographic c axis. The model is based on the results of annealing experiments for six selected apatites (five calcian fluorapatites and Durango apatite) representing a subset of the 15 total apatite specimens studied. An iterative process of calculation is required to project fission-track lengths onto the c axis and computer source code implementing the solution to this problem is presented. This method of projecting apatite fission-track lengths onto the crystallographic c axis is shown to remove effectively fission-track length variation within single fission-track populations due to anisotropic track-length reduction for all 15 apatites studied. In addition, a model is developed that offers predictions that closely reproduce published experimental data concerning the relationship between fission-track density (etched fission tracks per unit area of apatite surface) and the arithmetic mean fission-track length. Finally, it is shown that natural fission-track populations exhibit fission-track length anisotropy similar to that of fission-track populations created and annealed in the laboratory. This observation implies that the same process by which apatite fission tracks anneal in the laboratory is responsible for annealing of apatite fission tracks in the geological environment.},

abstract = {Numerical, thermal and rheological modelling techniques are applied to unravel the basin-forming processes and the heat flow and burial history of the Rheno-Hercynian fold belt (Rhenish Massif), the adjacent Subvariscan foreland (Ruhr Basin), and the intramontane Saar-Nahe Basin. Thermal history and crustal architecture in the study areas were affected mainly by the Variscan Orogeny during late Palaeozoic times. Calibration of the simulated thermal histories is primarily based on vitrinite reflectance and fission-track data. Mechanical modelling reveals average {beta} values of 1.7, reaching a maximum of 2.4 in the central basin (Mosel Graben) and at the transition to the Giessen Ocean to the south during Early Devonian rifting. This stage was associated with tholeitic magmatism and an elevated heat flow of up to 110 mW m-2, preserved in weakly overprinted syn-rift sediments. Average basal heat flow during maximum burial at the end of the Carboniferous period (i.e. the end of crustal shortening) was between 50 and 70 mW m-2 with a slight decrease from the Subvarian foreland basins towards the Rheno-Hercynian in the south. The values suggest average crustal thicknesses of between 32 and 36 km during late Carboniferous time. For the Saar-Nahe Basin, values between 50 and 75 mW/m2 represent the thermal regime in the upper crust during the late Stephanian and early Permian time. Estimated eroded thicknesses of Palaeozoic sediments vary between 2500 m in the northern and central Ruhr Basin and more than 6000 m in the Osteifel and the Siegen Anticline within the Rheno-Hercynian, and between 1800 and 3600 m in the Saar-Nahe Basin. Fission-track data provide evidence for significant reheating during the Mesozoic era within the entire study area. This phase of heating, probably linked to North Atlantic rifting, coincides with post-Variscan ore formation and with major tectono-magmatic events in central Europe.},

Simulations are carried out for a vertical section through a basin with a distance of 40 km separating the regional topographic high and low. Emphasis is placed on understanding the conditions under which advective effects significantly perturb the thermal field. The transition from conduction-dominated to advection-dominated thermal regimes is sharp and depends primarily on the topographic configuration of the water table, the magnitude and spatial distribution of permeability, hydraulic anisotropy, and the depth of active flow. Deviations of surface heat flow from the background heat flux are a measurable effect of groundwater flow and depend on the same factors. Our results show that from 0% to almost 100% of the section may have surface heat flow significantly different from background heat flow, depending upon the nature of the hydrogeologic environment. A limited spatial variability in a distributed set of heat flow measurements and/or linear temperature-depth profiles does not ensure that surface heat flow measurements are not disturbed. The results of our simulations suggest that knowledge of the complete environment of a site, including the water table configuration and subsurface flow system, combined with more closely spaced heat flow measurements may be necessary to unravel the true background heat flux in active flow regions.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional modelling study of sedimentation, fluid flow, and heat flow in the Baikal rift basin undergoing flank uplift and basin subsidence has been performed in order to understand the impact of these processes on the surface heat flow signal. Heat flow anomalies of different scales and magnitudes have been observed at the sediment surface of the lake Baikal basin, and the presence of a hydrothermal vent suggests that fluids play an important role in the regional distribution of heat flow. The BASIN-code applied for this study allows to simulate topographically and compaction-driven hydrodynamical fluid flow and coupled heat transfer.The flank uplift history provides the basis for a regional groundwater circulation towards the central basin area, with predicted Darcy velocities at present-day situation in the basement varying between 1 and 100 cm/year. Within the basin, the presence of aquifers and the pinch-out layering has a major control on the flow field, and compaction-driven flow velocities are strongly altered when combined with topography-driven flow. When velocities in the basement are larger than several centimeters per year, the regional fluid circulation is an effective mechanism of heat redistribution. Heat is brought from the flanks towards the basin area, with largest heat transported at a depth of 1-2 km at both sides. During the flank uplift, heat advection increases, with secondary variation related to the deposition of sedimentary layers. The heat flow is increased over the basin and reduced in the flanks, with a total heat output balance always positive. The extra heat output over the modelled transection is 2-10% of the initial heat output. The maximum computed heat fluxes are smaller than measured in the heat flow anomalies of the lake Baikal basin. Nevertheless, the model suggests that flow in the sedimentary basin combined with a topographically driven heat advection in the surrounding basement is a sufficient mechanism to account for the increased heat flow over the basin and the main features of the heat flow distribution.},

abstract = {Abstract  The Red Dog ore deposit district in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska is host to several high-grade, shale-hosted Zn + Pb
deposits. Due to the complex history and deformation of these ore deposits, the geological and hydrological conditions at
the time of formation are poorly understood. Using geological observations and fluid inclusion data as constraints, numerical
heat and fluid flow simulations of the Anarraaq ore deposit environment and coupled reactive flow simulations of a section
of the ore body were conducted to gain more insight into the conditions of ore body formation. Results suggest that the ore
body and associated base metal zonation may have formed by the mixing of oxidized, saline, metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids
(<200°C) with reducing, HS-rich pore fluids within radiolarite-rich host rocks. Sphalerite and galena concentrations and base
metal sulfide distribution are primarily controlled by the nature of the pore fluids, i.e., the extent and duration of the
HS− source. Forward modeling results also predict the distribution of pyrite and quartz in agreement with field observations
and indicate a reaction front moving from the initial mixing interface into the radiolarite rocks. Heuristic mass calculations
suggest that ore grades and base metal accumulation comparable to those found in the field (18% Zn, 5% Pb) are predicted to
be reached after about 0.3 My for initial conditions (30 ppm Zn, 3 ppm Pb; 20% deposition efficiency).},

abstract = {None of the standard porosity-velocity models (e.g. the time-average equation, Raymer's equations) is satisfactory for interpreting well-logging data over a broad depth range. Clays in the section are the usual source of the difficulty through the bias and scatter that they introduce into the relationship between porosity and P-wave transit time. Because clays are composed of fine sheet-like particles, they normally form pores with much smaller aspect ratios than those associated with sand grains. This difference in pore geometry provides the key to obtaining more consistent resistivity and sonic log interpretations. A velocity model for Clay2013sand mixtures has been developed in terms of the Kuster and Toks{\"{o}}z, effective medium and Gassmann theories. In this model, the total pore space is assumed to consist of two parts: (1) pores associated with sand grains and (2) pores associated with clays (including bound water). The essential feature of the model is the assumption that the geometry of pores associated with sand grains is significantly different from that associated with clays. Because of this, porosity in shales affects elastic compliance differently from porosity in sand-Stones. The predictive power of the model is demonstrated by the agreement between its predictions and laboratory measurements and by its ability to predict sonic logs from other logs over large depth intervals where formations vary from unconsolidated to consolidated sandstones and shales.},

abstract = {We argue that the observed conduit-barrier behavior of fault zones in siliciclastic sedimentary aquifer systems can be understood by considering a strongly anisotropic hydraulic structure in the fault. Hydraulic anisotropy in the fault is expected from a variety of mechanisms including clay-smearing, drag of sand, grain re-orientation and vertical segmentation of the fault plane. In this paper, we present an algorithm to predict fault zone width, lithological heterogeneity and hydraulic anisotropy. Estimation of these parameters is based upon the amount of fault throw and the clay-content of the lithologies flanking the fault zone. A suite of steady-state flow models are presented using an idealized stratigraphy consisting of alternating clay and sand-rich layers that are offset by a fault zone. These conceptual simulations show the impact of a fault zone on shallow (\textless500 m) fluid flow patterns and solute transport for different scenarios of fault throw. Fault width varies along the fault zone and increases from an average width of 2 m for a throw of 50 m to 8 m for a throw of 200 m. Hydraulic anisotropy in the fault zone in these scenarios is predicted to range between two to three orders of magnitude. Our results show that faults can form a preferential path way between aquifers at different depths over vertical distances of several hundreds of meters (that are otherwise separated by confining units) when fault permeability is strongly anisotropic. However, in the same scenario anomalously high hydraulic head gradients across the fault would still suggest that they act as an effective barrier to lateral groundwater flow. This has important implications for the assessment of the risk of a spread of contaminated groundwater or the reconstruction of hydrocarbon migration within sedimentary basins.},

abstract = {TOPO-EUROPE addresses the 4-D topographic evolution of the orogens and intra-plate regions of Europe through a multidisciplinary approach linking geology, geophysics, geodesy and geotechnology. TOPO-EUROPE integrates monitoring, imaging, reconstruction and modelling of the interplay between processes controlling continental topography and related natural hazards. Until now, research on neotectonics and related topography development of orogens and intra-plate regions has received little attention. TOPO-EUROPE initiates a number of novel studies on the quantification of rates of vertical motions, related tectonically controlled river evolution and land subsidence in carefully selected natural laboratories in Europe. From orogen through platform to continental margin, these natural laboratories include the Alps/Carpathians-Pannonian Basin System, the West and Central European Platform, the Apennines-Aegean-Anatolian region, the Iberian Peninsula, the Scandinavian Continental Margin, the East-European Platform, and the Caucasus-Levant area. TOPO-EUROPE integrates European research facilities and know-how essential to advance the understanding of the role of topography in Environmental Earth System Dynamics. The principal objective of the network is twofold. Namely, to integrate national research programs into a common European network and, furthermore, to integrate activities among TOPO-EUROPE institutes and participants. Key objectives are to provide an interdisciplinary forum to share knowledge and information in the field of the neotectonic and topographic evolution of Europe, to promote and encourage multidisciplinary research on a truly European scale, to increase mobility of scientists and to train young scientists. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of continental topography research, and of the challenges to TOPO-EUROPE researchers in the targeted natural laboratories.},

abstract = {The Southeast Basin in southern France is part of the north European continental margin of the Mezosoic Tethys. The original amount and extent of the Mesozoic sedimentary cover across this basin margin (formed from the Variscan Massif Central basement) is unknown and has been the subject of much debate. We have used apatite fission-track thermochronology to better understand Mesozoic sedimentation and later erosion histories of this region. Thirty-three outcrops and borehole samples were collected from Paleozoic granitic and metamorphic basement and Paleozoic and Triassic sandstones in broadly E-W transects. Except from a restricted area (Vivarais), measured fission-track ages are \textless130 Ma with mean track lengths between 10.7 and 13.8 [mu]m. Thermal histories based on fission-track age and length data are consistent with an episode of cooling that began at 130+/-10 Ma for the northern part of the study area and at 110+/-10 Ma for the southern part. This cooling is interpreted to be the result of denudation. The thickness of eroded rocks is estimated between 2000 and 2500 m, depending on the geothermal gradient and on the thermal conductivity of eroded rocks. The greatest amount of denudation occurred in the southern part of the study area. The presence of thin Triassic and Early Jurassic sediments preserved on the top of the Variscan basement implies that only a small part of the total thickness of eroded material corresponds to basement rocks. Paleogeographical data argue against a Triassic-Early Jurassic sedimentary cover thick enough to explain the recorded temperatures. This study suggests that the basement was buried beneath a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) sedimentary cover, which has been removed from mid-Cretaceous time. This interpretation differs strongly from earlier studies where the maximum onlap of the Southeast Basin deposits onto the basement was restricted to thin Early Jurassic rocks. Onset of denudation can be related to geodynamic events which affected southern France in mid-Cretaceous time, and that resulted from the opening of the Bay of Biscay (140-110 Ma).},

annote = {Intraplate compressional features, such as inverted extensional basins, upthrust basement blocks and whole lithospheric folds, play an important role in the structural framework of many cratons. Although compressional intraplate deformation can occur in a number of dynamic settings, stresses related to collisional plate coupling appear to be responsible for the development of the most important compressional intraplate structures. These can occur at distances of up to �1600 km from a collision front, both in the fore-arc (foreland) and back-arc (hinterland) positions with respect to the subduction system controlling the evolution of the corresponding orogen. Back-arc compression associated with island arcs and Andean-type orogens occurs during periods of increased convergence rates between the subducting and overriding plates. For the build-up of intraplate compressional stresses in fore-arc and foreland domains, four collision-related scenarios are envisaged: (1) during the initiation of a subduction zone along a passive margin or within an oceanic basin; (2) during subduction impediment caused by the arrival of more buoyant crust, such as an oceanic plateau or a microcontinent at a subduction zone; (3) during the initial collision of an orogenic wedge with a passive margin, depending on the lithospheric and crustal configuration of the latter, the presence or absence of a thick passive margin sedimentary prism, and convergence rates and directions; (4) during post-collisional over-thickening and uplift of an orogenic wedge. The build-up of collision-related compressional intraplate stresses is indicative for mechanical coupling between an orogenic wedge and its fore- and/or hinterland. Crustal-scale intraplate deformation reflects mechanical coupling at crustal levels whereas lithosphere-scale deformation indicates mechanical coupling at the level of the mantle-lithosphere, probably in response to collisional lithospheric over-thickening of the orogen, slab detachment and the development of a mantle back-stop. The intensity of collisional coupling between an orogen and its fore- and hinterland is temporally and spatially variable. This can be a function of oblique collision. However, the build-up of high pore fluid pressures in subducted sediments may also account for mechanical decoupling of an orogen and its fore- and/or hinterland. Processes governing mechanical coupling/decoupling of orogens and fore- and hinterlands are still poorly understood and require further research. Localization of collision-related compressional intraplate deformations is controlled by spatial and temporal strength variations of the lithosphere in which the thermal regime, the crustal thickness, the pattern of pre-existing crustal and mantle discontinuities, as well as sedimentary loads and their thermal blanketing effect play an important role. The stratigraphic record of collision-related intraplate compressional deformation can contribute to dating of orogenic activity affecting the respective plate margin.},

abstract = {A critique review of the state of quantitative basin modeling is presented. Over the last 15 years, a number of models are proposed to advance our understanding of basin evolution. However, as of present, most basin models are two dimensional (2-D) and subject to significant simplifications such as depth- or effective stress-dependent porosity, no stress calculations, isotropic fracture permeability, etc. In this paper, promising areas for future development are identified. The use of extensive data sets to calibrate basin models requires a comprehensive reaction, transport, mechanical (RTM) model in order to generate the synthetic response. An automated approach to integrate comprehensive basin modeling and seismic, well-log and other type of data is suggested. The approach takes advantage of comprehensive RTM basin modeling to complete an algorithm based on information theory that places basin modeling on a rigorous foundation. Incompleteness in a model can self-consistently be compensated for by an increase in the amount of observed data used. The method can be used to calibrate the transport, mechanical, or other laws underlying the model. As the procedure is fully automated, the predictions can be continuously updated as new observed data become available. Finally, the procedure makes it possible to augment the model itself as new processes are added in a way that is dictated by the available data. In summary, the automated data/model integration places basin simulation in a novel context of informatics that allows for data to be used to minimize and assess risk in the prediction of reservoir location and characteristics.},

abstract = {The concentration of mass during regional metamorphism and metallogenesis requires interactions between regional and local hydrothermal systems that are scale- and time-dependent. During regional low- to medium-temperature metamorphism in which fluid flow is driven by broad thermal or mechanical gradients, fluid flow rates are (on average) \textless10-8 m/s, and are limited by restricted permeabilities and gentle gradients in hydraulic head. In contrast, coseismic fluid flow rates in major fault zones may reach ≥10-2 m/s. As a consequence, there may be a limited capacity for individual faults to substantially control fluid flow in the region because of the large contrast in flow rates and permeabilities between faults and low permeability rocks. To produce a major epigenetic ore deposit in overpressured crust, fluid flow systems with such diverse flow rates must interact in such a way that metal dissolution and transport from regional fluid flow systems culminate in focused fluid flow with metal deposition. This is best achieved through two steps; one in which km-scale hydrothermal systems channel into 100 m-scale ductile shear zones largely by reaction- and deformation-enhanced permeability in the shear zone; and a second one in which rapid fluid pressure changes accompanying brittle faulting (or intense shearing) within the broader shear zones causes metal deposition and ore genesis.},

abstract = {The paleoclimate of the middle Pliocene (ca. 3 Ma) was generally warmer than present, particularly at middle to high latitudes. It has been suggested that this period may represent an analogue for future climate change. Mechanisms that have been proposed to account for this warming are enhanced thermohaline circulation and/or greater concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. We present new climate model simulations, supported by geological data that suggest that in the European and Mediterranean region the climate was warmer (by 5 degreesC), wetter (by 400-1000 mm/yr), and less seasonal than present. Modeling results suggest that an intensification of the Icelandic low-pressure system and the Azores high-pressure system occurred during the middle Pliocene as a direct result of higher annual sea-surface temperatures and reduced ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere. This change increased the surface pressure gradient over the region and strengthened annual westerly wind velocity by 4 m/s-1. Associated increases in wind stress (by 20 N/m-2) over the North Atlantic Ocean may have enhanced the flow of surface currents such as the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current, which in turn would have sustained the higher sea-surface temperatures. These changes to the regional climate system would have driven greater atmospheric and oceanic transport of heat from equatorial regions to the North Atlantic Ocean, particularly during winter. Such conditions are proposed as a likely cause of the warming indicated for Europe and the Mediterranean ca. 3 Ma.},

abstract = {The Taranaki Basin is an active-margin basin that has been significantly affected by Miocene subduction tectonics along the Pacific-Australian plate boundary. We have analyzed its present-day thermal state using 354 bottom-hole temperatures (BHTs) from 115 wells distributed throughout the basin. The measured temperatures were corrected using an exact solution to Bullard's equation rather than the Horner approximation, thereby allowing for recovery dependence on well diameter and correction for some BHTs at early time after circulation had ceased. Thermal conductivity measurements were completed on 256 samples from eight wells, and matrix conductivities were determined for six end-member lithologies by inversion. Formation conductivities are based on the conductivity and relative proportion of each end-member component. Corrected BHTs, in situ thermal conductivity, and estimates of sediment heat production were combined to compute the present-day, steady state heat flow. The average heat flow is 60 mW m-2, but important geographic variations are present: heat flow on the Western Platform is remarkably consistent at 53-60 mW m-2, attesting to its relative stability since the Late Cretaceous; heat flow in the southern part of the basin is 65N70 mW m-2 due to as much as 3 km of late Miocene erosion; on the southern onshore and to the south of the peninsula, heat flow is 50+/-3 mW m-2, possibly due to the heat sink effects of crustal thickening; heat flow is highest at 74 mW m-2 on the northern peninsula adjacent to the Taranaki volcanic zone; suggesting a causal relationship between Quaternary volcanism and high heat flow.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Bottom-hole temperatures (BHT) from oil exploration provide useful constraints on the subsurface thermal regime, but they need to be corrected to obtain the equilibrium temperature. In this work, we introduce several BHT correction methods and compare them using a large Australian data set of more than 650 groups of multiple BHT measurements in about 300 oil exploration boreholes. Existing and suggested corrections are classified within a coherent framework, in which methods are divided into: line/cylinder source; instantaneous/continuous heat extraction; one/two component(s). Comparisons with reservoir test temperatures show that most of the corrections lead to reliable estimates of the formation equilibrium temperature within +-10 oC, but too few data exist to perform an intercomparison of the models based on this criterion. As expected, the Horner method diverges from its parent models for small elapsed times (or equivalently large radii). The mathematical expression of line source models suffers from an unphysical delay time that also restrains their domain of applicability. The model that takes into account the difference of thermal properties between circulating mud and surrounding rocks-that is the two-component model-is delicate to use because of its high complexity. For these reasons, our preferred correction methods are the cylindrical source models. We show that mud circulation time below 10 hr has a negligible effect. The cylindrical source models rely on one parameter depending on the thermal diffusivity and the borehole radius, which are poorly constrained, but the induced uncertainty on the extrapolations remains reasonably low.},

Partial climatic range diagrams are presented for: Abies alba, Acer monspessulanum, Acer tataricum, Buxus sempervirens, Tilia tomentosa. The problem of time correlation and pollen zonation of the Eemian is discussed. The climatic analysis itself is based on an improved version of the indicator species method. In this version not every site is analysed for its climatic values. Instead maps and tables on the migrational history of Hedera, Ilex, Buxus, Abies and species of Acer, Tilia and Abies are the basis for climatic maps showing respectively January and July isotherms for the periods of the Corylus zone (E4a) and the Carpinus zone (E5). It is concluded that mean January temperatures were as much as 3[degree sign]C higher at Amsterdam (The Netherlands), than at present, and mean temperatures in July were 2[degree sign]C higher. However, the thermal maximum in winter was later (zone E5) than the summer thermal maximum (zone E4a). Winter temperatures changed parallel to rise and fall of global sea-level. Precipitation changes are more difficult to estimate. In the first part of the Eemian precipitation must have been relatively low, but from zone E4b onward it increased to higher values, reaching 800 mm and probably substantially more in zones E5 and E6. Hence the Eemian climate was in its beginning relatively more contintental, and later (from E4b onward) more oceanic. However, as compared with the Holocene, the Eemian climate was, generally speaking, more oceanic.},

abstract = {Sand-rich injectites are a common attribute of clastic sedimentary successions, and they have received increased attention in the last decade by geoscientists and engineers dealing with shallow subsurface flow and retention of aqueous and hydrocarbon fluids. Injectites form due to fluidized flow of sediment-entraining fluids through high-permeability strata. Given that sediment entrainment is confined to high-permeability sediments with low horizontal effective stress and negligible cementation, the formation of sand-rich injectites is restricted to the first kilometre of burial, where sand-rich sediments are prone to fluidization and clay-rich sediments are generally more cohesive and may hydraulically fracture to allow the creation of injectites. When reviewing conditions that may lead to aqueous and hydrocarbon flow within this shallow section at velocities that may cause sand fluidization and injection, we can rule out geologic time-scale processes (disequilibrium compaction, hydrocarbon migration, and lateral pressure transfer) as plausible causes. This emphasizes the need for high-strain-rate processes to cause rapid fluid overpressuring and flow associated with sand injection. Earthquake-induced shaking, instantaneous loading and release of overpressured fluids along moving fault planes are the most likely causes of sand remobilization and injection and these processes may enforce each other during tectonic stress-release events. An additional mechanism that may trigger sand-rich injections is the mechanical failure of shallow oil accumulations, particularly as the fluidization velocity of sand entrained in oil can be several orders of magnitude lower than for sand entrained in aqueous fluids, particularly if the oil is biodegraded (and thus has a high dynamic viscosity). Flow of hydrocarbon gas is unlikely to cause sand injection, although gas dissolved in upward-flowing aqueous fluids may evolve at or near the surface as pressures in the aqueous phase drop.},

abstract = {Rifting activity is probably mainly governed by frictional forces exerted on the base of the lithosphere by the convecting sub-lithospheric upper mantle, combined with deviatoric tensional stresses developing over upwelling branches of the asthenospheric convection system, and by far-filed stresses controlling the interaction of lithospheric plates moving relative to each other. Mantle plumes rising from the deep mantle do not appear to be a major driving force of rifting. Therefore, it is questioned whether a distinction between "active" and "passive" rifts is still justified. Lithospheric extension triggers by decompression partial melting of the lower lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. Magmatic processes contribute materially to thinning of the subcrustal lithosphere and probably also of the lower crust. This could explain the frequently observed discrepancy between upper crustal extension by faulting and lower crustal attenuation as defined by refraction and deep reflection seismic data. The duration of the rifting stage of palaeorifts and passive margins is highly variable. Depending on plate interaction, crustal separation can be achieved after as little as 7 Ma and as much as 280 Ma of rifting activity. The availability of crustal discontinuities does not appear to play a significant role in the time required for crustal separation to be achieved. The structural style of rifts is controlled by the physical state of the lithosphere, the mode and amount of its extension and the lithological composition of pre- and syn-rift sediments. Subsidence of rift basins is controlled by the balance between isostatic adjustment of the crust to lithospheric stretching and uplift induced by mechanical and thermal attenuation of the subcrustal lithosphere. Post-rift basin subsidence is mainly governed by the decay of rift-induced thermal anomalies; densification of the lower crust and intra-plate stresses provide overprinting effects. In view of this it is unlikely that quantitative analyses of post-rift basin subsidence give a direct measure of lithospheric extension. Tectonically active rifts, palaeorifts and passive margin basins contain major hydrocarbon provinces. Their hydrocarbon charge can rely exclusively on pre-rift, syn-rift or post-rift sedimentary sequences or a combination thereof. Maturation of source-rocks can be achieved during the syn- and/or post-rift stage of basin evolution. During rifting, conductive and convective heat transfer accounts for elevated geothermal gradients; these play an important role in the maturation of pre and syn-rift source-rocks; thermal gradients decrease asymptotically during the post-rift stage.},

abstract = {The magmatic response to extension of the continental lithosphere, with the resultant formation of sedimentary basins, varies widely. Quantitative models (e.g. McKenzie and Bickle, 1988), based upon an assumption of anhydrous partial melting in both lithosphere and asthenosphere, suggest that the temperature of the sub-lithospheric upper mantle, upwelling beneath the zone of extension, exerts a fundamental control on both the chemistry and volume of the erupted magmas. High volcanicity rifts are, in general, only likely to occur when the asthenospheric potential temperature is ca. 100-300[degree sign]C greater than normal, associated with the activity of mantle plumes. In addition, such models also predict a strong correlation between the volume of magma produced and the amount of lithospheric stretching ([beta]). More complex models (e.g. Gallagher and Hawkesworth, 1992) include partial melting of volatile-rich mantle source regions with lower than normal solidus temperatures. These may reside within mantle plumes or within enriched domains within the continental lithospheric mantle. Quantitative modelling of the magma generation process in the latter case is limited by our rather poor understanding of volatile-present partial melting of the range of potential source components. Geochemical and isotopic (Sr–Nd–Pb–O) studies of the igneous rocks emplaced within a basin are of fundamental importance in evaluating the relative roles of lithospheric versus asthenospheric source components in the petrogenesis of the magmas and the depth and degree of partial melting. In addition, these data may provide important constraints on the amount of crustal contamination which has occurred, particularly by partial melting of the lower crust. Knowledge of the latter is important in the development of models to explain crustal thinning. In many basins the bulk of the mantle-derived magmas may never actually reach the surface, but are underplating and intruding the lower crust instead. Identification of such a mafic underplate is critical if the amount of crustal thinning is to be evaluated correctly. The location of eruptive sites within individual basins is frequently determined by pre-existing basement structures. Within the extensive Mesozoic rift system of West and Central Africa, Pan-African lithospheric shear zones and deep basement faults have acted as foci for rift basin development, with the faults acting as magma pathways to the surface. In western and central Europe, Neogene–Recent extension has generated an extremely varied magmatic response which can be correlated with the Hercynian structural grain of the lithosphere. The Rhine graben, trending at a high angle to the Hercynian terrane boundaries is largely amagmatic. In contrast the Ohre rift of Czechoslovakia, which trends parallel to a major (Saxothuringian–Moldanubian) terrane boundary, is a classic example of a pure shear rift with major volcanic complexes located along the axial zone.},

abstract = {Data from 90 tracer experiments performed in low-permeability fractured media have been studied to explore correlations among parameters controlling flow and transport. The original data had been interpreted by different authors using different models, which prevents direct comparison of their estimated parameters. In order to produce comparable parameters, the data have been reexamined using simple models (homogeneous domain, steady-state flow regime, single porosity). Specifically, hydraulic conductivity has been derived as the ratio of water flux to head gradient and apparent porosity as the ratio of water velocity to water flux; the former estimated from both first and peak arrival times. Hydraulic conductivity and porosity correlate along a straight line of slope 1:3 in log scale. While the regression is too noisy to be of predictive use, it lends some support to the use of a generalized cubic law. The fact that correlation for first arrival time porosity (0.77) is larger than for peak arrival porosity (0.62) suggests that first arrival is controlled by the same flow paths as hydraulic conductivity. Apparent porosity derived from peak arrival time is found to grow with travel time along a line of 0.55 slope (again log scale). The correlation coefficient ranges between 0.73 and 0.80 (depending on the data set) for hard rocks. The fact that this correlation is maintained when varying the flow rate at a given site leads us to suggest that it is caused by diffusion mechanisms. This conclusion is further supported by the increase of apparent porosity with the matrix porosity of the rock on which the experiments were performed.},

Hydrochemical zones, representing groundwater flow over thousands to tens of thousands of years, can be traced over large distances through the primarily siliciclastic aquifer system. The locations of the hydrochemical zones mostly reflect the “modern” predevelopment hydraulic-head distribution, but are inconsistent with a trough in predevelopment water levels in the west-central part of the basin, indicating that this trough is a transient rather than a long-term feature of the aquifer system. Radiocarbon ages adjusted for geochemical reactions, mixing, and evapotranspiration/dilution processes in the aquifer system were nearly identical to the unadjusted radiocarbon ages, and ranged from modern to more than 30 ka. Age gradients from piezometer nests ranged from 0.1 to 2 year cm –1 and indicate a recharge rate of about 3 cm year –1 for recharge along the eastern mountain front and infiltration from the Rio Grande near Albuquerque. There has been appreciably less recharge along the eastern mountain front north and south of Albuquerque.},

abstract = {We investigate in this paper the possible origin of the high heat flow anomaly observed in the Massif Central (100-110 mW m-2). A detailed study of crustal heat production shows that the radioactive component cannot account for the entire surface anomaly. However, when we remove the integrated radioactive contribution from the surface heat flow, it appears that the anomaly is reduced to a smaller area close to the Cenozoic graben and the volcanic area, with an amplitude of 25-30 mW m-2. This mantle heat flow anomaly is interpreted as a transient component related to a mantle diapir ascent in the Massif Central since the Oligocene, also outlined by several other geological and geophysical studies. A kinematic model of thermal diapir in the mantle can explain this transient anomaly as well as other independent sets of data (gravity anomaly, topography, lithospheric thickness, partial melting) provided the vertical velocity of the ascent is 1 cm yr-1, the width of the diapir 40 km and the depth where it initiates 150 km.},

abstract = {Deformation bands represent a common type of strain localization in deformed porous sandstones and occur as single structures, as clusters, and in fault damage zones. They show from zero to six orders of magnitude reduction in permeability and may therefore potentially affect fluid flow. We here present mathematical calculations indicating that uncommonly high permeability contrasts and/or exceptionally high band concentrations are required for deformation bands to significantly affect production rate. We also present field observations showing rapid variations in porosity and permeability along deformation bands and deformation-band zones alike. Furthermore, many paleofluid fronts seen in the field are unaffected or only gently affected by deformation bands. Together, these calculations and observations suggest that their function during reservoir production is small or negligible in most cases. Structural complications caused by subseismic faulting and complex fault anatomy are more likely to cause production problems, in addition to stratigraphic and diagenetic effects. Nevertheless, the arrangement and orientation of deformation bands may have an effect on the flow pattern and reservoir sweep. In cases where deformation bands do cause production problems, it may be possible to resolve these by means of hydraulic fracturing.},

abstract = {Apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th)/He data from the Sandia Mountains and Hagan embayment provide new insights into the thermal and tectonic evolution of the eastern flank of the Rio Grande rift in northern New Mexico. AFT and (U-Th)/He data reveal rapid cooling in the Sandia Mountains between 22 and 17 Ma, followed by a decrease in cooling rate at 16 to 14 Ma that temporally corresponds to a hiatus in deposition in the Albuquerque basin. A second increase in cooling rate at approximately 14 Ma was followed by continued slow cooling until present. Cooling ages from Jurassic to Permian sandstones in the Hagan embayment northeast of the Sandia Mountains are used to constrain the thermal conditions in Oligocene time that are necessary to map cooling histories into exhumation histories, thereby providing a limit on the amount of section removed during rift flank development. Thermal modeling, geologic constraints, and low-temperature thermochronology are used to demonstrate that the heat flow in the Sandia Mountain region was at least 25 mW/m2 higher during Oligocene time compared to today. Furthermore, at least 3.1 km of material has been exhumed from the Sandia Mountains and 2.4 km of rock uplift occurred during flexural tilting of the block since middle Miocene time.},

abstract = {We employ a kinematic model of continental extension to assess the lithospheric structure across the Baikal rift zone. The model includes simple shear extension of the upper crust along detachment faults and independent pure-shear thinning of the lower crust and mantle. Model predictions of topography, gravity anomalies and surface heat flow are compared with observations along two sections, one crossing the central Baikal rift and the other across northern Baikal. For the central Baikal profile, topography and gravity anomaly patterns are fit by a uniform extension model: upper crustal extension of approximately 19 km is equalled by a predicted mantle thinning factor [delta] \textless 2. In contrast, the high flank topography and strongly negative gravity anomalies across the northern Baikal basin require the approximately 12 km of crustal extension there to be accompanied by much higher mantle thinning factors ([delta] = 4-6). A model of non-uniform mantle thinning below northern Baikal is supported by P-T estimates for Miocene and Quaternary lherzolite xenoliths from the Vitim volcanic field. The rate of extension has a minor influence on the predicted topography and gravity anomaly patterns. None of the models predicts a significant (\textgreater 10 mW m-2) increase in regional surface heat flow. The short-wavelength, large-amplitude variability of the observed surface heat flow requires crustal redistribution processes involving large-scale ground water flow. The modelled topography and gravity anomaly patterns suggest that a possible asthenospheric upwarp is more likely to be situated below the northern than below the central Baikal basin, in contrast with earlier inferences from teleseismic and gravity studies.},

The margin was developed due to Tethyan rifting during the Liassic and Middle Jurassic and regional thermal subsidence as the Ligurian ocean was spreading in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Coevally, the margin underwent additional stretching in response to North Atlantic rifting. Inversion was initiated by Late Cretaceous times when the Ligurian oceanic crust began to be subducted, with localized obduction, beneath the previously passive margin. The most recent inversion of the Western Alps occurred in the external Molasse basin of Manosque-Digne-Valensole during the Late Miocene and Pliocene. Regions of mild inversion allow useful comparisons to be made with more strongly inverted basins. The geometric characteristics of the inverted basins depend on the lithology, geometry of the extensional structures, orientation of extensional faults with respect to the compressive Alpine stresses and the amount of compression. Comparisons of the external and interal zones suggest that the ductilely deformed thrust sheets may have originated from inverted half-grabens.},

abstract = {The present paper investigates the hydraulic conditions which could perturb a palaeoclimatically induced temperature signal in the underground. By a series of forward model analysis the behaviour of a Pleistocene Ice-Age-induced surface temperature change is analysed. It is shown that even at high Darcy fluid velocities of 5 x 10-8 m s-1 the transient temperature wave remains preserved although altering its shape with depth and amplitude. The forward results were later on analysed by a backward process which inverts the temperature signal and ideally should reproduce the given temperature history. Since the inversion routine assumes pure diffusive conditions in a 1-D horizontally layered medium, large deviations did show up in the case of an advectively influenced subsurface. A proposed correction strategy, reducing the borehole temperature logs first for their steady-state advective component before applying the inversion process yields much smaller deviations and reasonable climatic signals even for Darcy fluid velocities of 10-8 m s-1. Knowing that a palaeoclimatic temperature signal must be visible in subsurface, an earlier steady-state thermal study of the German Continental Deep Drilling Project has been improved. The actual successful forward fitting process accounts for advection, topography, lithological heterogeneities and a transient temperature signal induced by surface temperature changes. The last temperature log could be excellently fitted with a maximum temperature difference of only 0.3 K between 300 m and 3000 m. The model assumptions required a realistic distribution of the main lithologies. In the considered depth range the temperature field at KTB is strongly dominated by palaeoclimatic effects and by lithological heterogeneities. Thermal advection seems to be visible but of secondary importance only.},

For crystalline rocks, in situ k ranged from about 1 [mu]d (10-14 cm2) to 100 md; for argillaceous rocks it was about 0.01 to 1 [mu]d. No systematic decrease of k with depth was evident; over some interval at nearly every well, k was 1 to 100 md; these highly conductive intervals were as deep as 2-3 km. In situ permeability has been inferred from earthquake precursors, anomalous pore pressure, leakage from aquifers or other large-scale phenomena. Where crystalline rocks are involved, k was about 0.1 to 10 md, and thus about the same as the more permeable zones in wells; this is close to the permeability of many sandstones and is about 103 times greater than laboratory,measurements for intact crystalline rocks. For argillaceous rocks, laboratory, in situ, and inferred values all agreed within about a factor of 10. Laboratory study of artificial fractures suggest that in situ values for crystalline rocks are high because of natural fractures; fractures may be sealed or absent in shale.Based on observed variation in wells, k at particular sites in crystalline rock is not predictable within a factor of 105. For crystalline rocks, laboratory values provide little more than the minimum in situ k; for argillaceous rocks they may provide a good estimate of in situ k. Because of the great sensitivity of k to the effective stress, measurement or estimation of k must be tailored to the particular stress state of the application.If, as tentatively suggested by in situ and inferred values of k, average crustal k is about 10 md, pore pressure much greater than hydrostatic seems ruled out in terrains of outcropping crystalline rocks. Apart from hot pluton environments, anomalously high pore pressures seem to require everywhere a thick blanket of clay-rich rocks, as originally suggested for sedimentary basins.},

Calculated maximum temperatures, based on borehole data and vitrinite reflectance, regional thicknesses and a heat flow of 84 mW/m2 during the Late Westphalian, range from 110 °C at the top to 175 °C at the bottom of the Westphalian cored in this borehole. The high coalification (0.85–1.30% Ro) of the Westphalian C and D strata in KB172 could be the result of the deposition of $\sim$2500 m of Upper Permian to Middle Jurassic sediments in combination with elevated heat flows (71–80 mW/m2). Two coalification periods, i.e. Late Westphalian and Middle Jurassic, are suggested for this borehole. The simulated maximum temperatures range from 130 °C at the top to 175 °C at the bottom of the investigated Westphalian C and D.

These diagenetic effects are examined in the context of detailed fracture characterizations generated by geomechanical modelling. Aperture, length and fracture network geometry are examined in the context of subcritical crack growth and various biaxial loading boundary conditions of varying initial anisotropy. An isotropic initial state results in more polygonal fracture patterns. A small initial anisotropy creates preferential through-going fractures that are later connected by cross-fractures. A larger initial anisotropy results in only one parallel set. The flow connectivity of isotropic and small strain anisotropic patterns appears high based on trace pattern geometry, but when the effects of diagenesis are added, preferentially filling smaller aperture fracture segments, connectivity can be significantly reduced. Finite difference, steady-state flow simulations demonstrate the permeability effects of heterogeneous fracture aperture distributions predicted by the mechanical model and permeability reduction caused by systematic diagenetic fracture sealing.},

abstract = {Three major fracture types in the Dinantian of the Namur syncline at the northern margin of the Variscan foreland in southern Belgium, have been investigated by fluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis. The oldest and volumetrically most important fracture type is characterized by conjugated and sigmoidal en-echelon calcite veins which formed during the Variscan folding. These veins, and the surrounding limestones, have both a similar dull brown-orange luminescence and stable isotopic composition ($\delta$18O = −11. to −8‰ PDB and $\delta$13C = 0. to + 3‰ PDB). This indicates precipitation of the calcite cement from a fluid buffered by the rock. In the area studied, only a limited amount of fluids was expelled through the Dinantian during the main phase of Variscan compressional tectonism. Fractures filled with ferroan calcites cross-cut the Variscan .folds. Fluid inclusion and stable isotopic evidence indicates that the calcites precipitated at 40°–60°C from a saline fluid (9.2 to 23.2 eq. wt% NaCl) with an estimated $\delta$18O composition between −2.0‰ and −0.6. SMOW. The most likely origin of these high-salinity fluids with a relatively low-oxygen isotopic composition is a gravity-driven meteoric water which underwent an intense water-rock interaction. The topographic relief created by the Variscan tectonism could have allowed groundwater to penetrate into the deeper subsurface and to migrate towards the margin of the foreland basin. Non-ferroan, fracture-filling calcites formed later during the Mesozoic or Tertiary. Low-salinity meteoric waters and high-salinity CaCl2---NaCl brines with a temperature around 50°C migrated through this fracture system. Along these fractures, meteoric water migrated down into the subsurface and the brines could have flowed upward from the basement.},

abstract = {Heat is of fundamental importance in the genesis of continental rift zones. Heat flow data are available from the Baikal, Basin and Range (North America), East African, Rhine and Rio Grande rift systems, and most of the data indicate high heat flow, with means of 70-125 mW m-2, from the grabens in the rift systems. Data from the essentially non-volcanic sections of the East African rift system indicate normal to low heat flow, however. With the exception of the Basin and Range system, and parts of the Rio Grande system, the high heat flow appears to be restricted to the grabens, and is not measured on the broad domal or plateau uplifts associated with the rift systems. The uplifts associated with rifts typically are on the order of 1 to 2 km, with diameters of a few hundred kilometers or more, and the duration of the main phase of uplift is on the order of a few tens of million years, or less. These broad uplifts probably result from thermal changes in the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Two thermal models of the lithosphere are developed for comparison with the heat flow and uplift data. The first model assumes very slow lithospheric thinning so that the lithosphere remains in a state of quasi-equilibrium during the thinning. The second model assumes that thinning occurs at a rate significantly faster than heat can be conducted into the base of the lithosphere, with thermal relaxation of the lithosphere occurring after the cessation of thinning. Comparison of uplift rates with the model results indicates that for uplift purposes in rift genesis, the lithosphere is in a state between the two models i.e. partial heating of the lithosphere, or close to the rapid thinning state. Some uplift is predicted to continue after thinning has ceased due to thermal relaxation in the lithosphere. With respect to surface heat flow, however, the rapid thinning model is always predicted to apply, and a surface heat flow anomaly is not predicted to develop until after thinning has stopped. Local (graben) heat flow anomalies are thought to be primarily due to convection of heat into the rift zones by ascending magmas. A regional conducted thermal anomaly is not predicted to develop until after uplift is essentially complete. These predictions are compatible with the available heat flow and uplift data.},

Observations from a number of areas in Europe's intraplate lithosphere demonstrate that these mechanisms commonly interact in space and time. We present the results of thermomechanical modelling addressing the role of factors such as the presence of a hot upper mantle, the spatial dimensions of the plume and the time constants involved in the temporal succession of plume activity and lithospheric folding by stress accumulation in intraplate continental lithosphere. The results demonstrate that both the processes, plume2013lithosphere interactions and folding may interact resulting either in strong amplification, attenuation or modification of their surface expression.

abstract = {Two-dimensional, porous-medium, steady-state, coupled fluid- and heat-transport models are used to investigate some of the hydrogeological and thermal consequences of steeply dipping fault damage zones in a normally pressured basin setting. Simple geometries and conservative petrophysical properties can produce large-scale buoyancy-driven circulation, both outside and within the fault zone. An average (homogeneous) basin permeability of only 7 mD kh (horizontal permeability) and 0.07 mD kv (vertical permeability) results in a free convection cell of this type, with the upflow being localized by a 300 m wide fault zone (50 mD kh, 0.5 mD kv). Steady-state temperature anomalies as large as 15degreesC at the top of the fault zone can be produced by this arrangement. Smaller values of basin permeability still result in a similar circulation pattern, but at flow rates which produce temperature anomalies that are below detection levels. When the basin fill is more heterogeneous (layered), higher permeabilities can exist in some layers without large-scale convection occurring, because of the dampening effect of other, lower permeability units. In realistic geometrical configurations that are similar to the North Sea Central Graben, the fluid flow system is dominated by within-fault-zone convective circulation that produces local (\textless10 km half-wavelength), high amplitude (50degreesC) temperature anomalies which are comparable to the largest of those actually observed in the subsurface.},

abstract = {[`]Inversion structures' (e.g. folds, reverse faults) spatially associated with basin-bounding faults are very widely recognised in rift basins in both onshore and offshore settings worldwide. The great majority of such structures are attributed to local or regional crustal shortening events. There is, however, an alternative, which is investigated in this paper: inversion could reflect a horizontal shortening component of deformation formed during progressive and partitioned transtension. A case study from the Carboniferous Northumberland Basin shows that shortening structures can also form in obliquely divergent rifts if the bulk strain undergoes kinematic partitioning into distinct regions of wrench- and extension-dominated transtension. Such strain partitioning appears to be particularly favoured in basins where fault localisation is strongly influenced by pre-existing basement structures. This may occur because the pre-existing anisotropies are zones of long-lived weakness that lie in an orientation particularly favourable to the preferential accommodation of either strike-slip or dip-slip displacements. Our strain analysis applied to the Northumberland Basin, traditionally considered as a classic example of a Variscan inverted basin, reduces the deformation history to a single kinematically partitioned phase of dextral transtension during the late Carboniferous-early Permian. Our findings have profound implications for the interpretation of inversion structures in any rift basin where the direction of extension may be significantly oblique to the basin margins.},

abstract = {An updated review of the available geothermal data for Slovenia is presented. In order to evaluate the main tectono-thermal characteristics, an overview of three most relevant geophysical parameters, namely heat flow density, the distribution of shallow seismicity, and the depth of the Mohorovicic boundary, over a much larger, so-called Circum-Adriatic region, extending from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Pannonian basin, is first given. The pattern and values of these parameters in the Adriatic Sea and just outside this area differ significantly from those of the outlying environment, and thus correspond roughly to the area known as the Adriatic microplate. Slovenia is situated at the northern rim of this geophysically diversified region. In the western part of the country, where the Dinarides and Southern Alps are situated, a good correlation has been found between the deeply lying Mohorovicic discontinuity, the low heat flow density, low temperatures at depth and a large negative Bouguer anomaly, whereas in the eastern part of Slovenia (the Pannonian basin) the rising mantle-crust boundary is associated with the high heat flow density, high temperatures at depth and a positive Bouguer anomaly. At the transition zone between the Southern Alps and the Dinarides, along the area of changing crustal thickness, a shallow seismicity belt is indicated. The only DSS profile in Slovenia, crossing the country in a SW-NE direction from Pula (Croatia) to Maribor, reflects the tectonic relations and seismicity between the Dinarides and the Pannonian basin.},

abstract = {Estimations of porosity and permeability from well logs are important yet difficult tasks encountered in geophysical formation evaluation and reservoir engineering. Motivated by recent results of artificial neural network (ANN) modelling offshore eastern Canada, we have developed neural nets for converting well logs in the North Sea to porosity and permeability. We use two separate back-propagation ANNs (BP-ANNs) to model porosity and permeability. The porosity ANN is a simple three-layer network using sonic, density and resistivity logs for input. The permeability ANN is slightly more complex with four inputs (density, gamma ray, neutron porosity and sonic) and more neurons in the hidden layer to account for the increased complexity in the relationships. The networks, initially developed for basin-scale problems, perform sufficiently accurately to meet normal requirements in reservoir engineering when applied to Jurassic reservoirs in the Viking Graben area. The mean difference between the predicted porosity and helium porosity from core plugs is less than 0.01 fractional units. For the permeability network a mean difference of approximately 400 mD is mainly due to minor core-log depth mismatch in the heterogeneous parts of the reservoir and lack of adequate overburden corrections to the core permeability. A major advantage is that no a priori knowledge of the rock material and pore fluids is required. Real-time conversion based on measurements while drilling (MWD) is thus an obvious application.},

abstract = {Thermal rock properties were determined for the Northeast German Basin, a subbasin of the southern Permian basin in Europe. The new thermal data provide new aspects for the determination of heat flow and for hydrocarbon and geothermal resource evaluation in the basin. Thermal conductivity was measured on drill-core samples using the optical scanning method. Values for Permian and pre-Permian clastic rocks are variable (2.3ndash4.8 W/m/K) because of different depositional environments, compaction, and cementation reflected in lithology. PermianndashCarboniferous igneous rocks show lowest thermal conductivity in basalts (2.2 W/m/K) and highest (3.1 W/m/K) in granitoids. Anisotropy of thermal conductivity in all rocks is low. Formation thermal conductivity was determined by upscaling the values determined for single lithotypes. Radiogenic heat production was determined on drill cores for the upper Paleozoic sediments and igneous rocks. For the younger formations without sample control, a well-log approach was used. The heat production of sedimentary rocks is lowest (0.4 muW/m3) in the Permian (Zechstein) salt and anhydrite and highest (2.1 muW/m3) in the Permian (Rotliegende) clastic rocks. Heat production of the PermianndashCarboniferous rhyolites and granitoids is on the order of 2.6ndash3.8 muW/m3, and heat production of andesites and basaltoids is on the order of 0.9ndash1.9 and 0.1ndash0.7 muW/m3, respectively. The contribution to surface heat flow by these up to 2-km (1.2-mi)-thick igneous complexes amounts to 7 mW/m2 at a maximum. On the same order is the total heat budget provided by the supra-Permian sedimentary succession in the basin.},

Recent models have thus suggested that the rate of interseismic fluid-pressure increase may control earthquake recurrence. In electric-analog model simulations incorporating new experimental data on rock properties within the lower seismogenic zone, resultant fluid-pressure fluctuations are restricted to the fault plane, and are strongly attenuated during their slow propagation into the country rock. Fluid-pressure drops, triggered by coseismic fault dilation, require days to hundreds of years to propagate over distances ≥1 m into low-permeability country rock (≤10 m). The equilibration of fluid pressure between the faulted and the intact country rock requires tens to hundreds of years. If the fault seals prior to this equilibration, the fluid pressure recovers instantaneously to near the prefailure value. These results may imply that if elevated fluid pressure weakens transcrustal fault zones, they are likely to remain weak after earthquakes.},

abstract = {A key component of sedimentary basin evolution is the spatial distribution and temporal variation of stress and deformation. The many deformation processes (poroelasticity, fracturing, irreversible nonlinear viscosity, and pressure solution) are inextricably bound in a tightly coupled network which, in turn, is coupled to a myriad of basin diagenetic, thermal and hydrologic processes. In the approach presented here, the various deformation processes are integrated through an incremental stress approach. Together with mass, momentum and energy conservation, this approach yields a complete, fully coupled basin model that captures basin and fault phenomena that are beyond the scope of simpler or decoupled models. Many of the most interesting basin phenomena are not only dependent on multiple, coupled processes but also are fundamentally three-dimensional. To address this three-dimensional complexity, we have developed a numerical simulator using a moving, adapting, accreting finite element grid which is allowed to deform and to grow and adapt with the addition of sediment to capture smaller sedimentary features. As a result, our fully coupled, comprehensive model allows one to solve a number of key problems in basin and fault dynamics. These include compaction, fractured reservoir and compartment genesis and dynamics. Examples illustrating these applications are presented for idealized systems and the Piceance Basin (Colorado) and the Permian Basin (West Texas). The incremental stress rheology is found to be a powerful formalism for integrating basin hydrology, diagenesis and mechanics.},

The compressional mode of deformation in these sedimentary basins, originally formed by extension in an intraplate setting, is characterized by a spectrum of spatial wavelengths spanning several tens of kilometres up to several hundreds of kilometres. The actual mode of compressional deformation appears to be strongly affected by the rheological structure of the underlying lithosphere, the level of the regional intraplate stress field, and the geometry of the rifted basin configuration prior to late-stage compressional reactivation. The interplay of plumes and intraplate compressional deformation can lead to temporal transitions from basin inversion to lithospheric folding. These modes of deformation lead to substantial differential vertical motions, late-stage anomalies in subsidence and uplift patterns. The development of innovative combinations of numerical and analogue modelling techniques is the key to differentiating different modes of compressional deformation of passive margins and extensional basins.},

abstract = {Until now, research on neotectonics and related seismicity has mostly focused on active plate boundaries characterized by generally high earthquake activity. Current seismic hazard estimates for intraplate areas are commonly based on probabilistic analyses of historical and instrumental earthquake data. The accuracy of these hazard estimates is limited by the nature of the data (e.g. ambiguous historical sources) and by the restriction of available earthquake catalogues to time scales of only few hundred years, which are geologically insignificant and not suitable to describe the tectonic processes causing earthquakes. This is especially relevant to intraplate regions where faults show slow slip rates resulting in long average recurrence times for large earthquakes (103-106 yr).The Alpine orogen and intraplate sedimentary basins and rifts of its northern foreland are associated with a much higher level of neotectonic activity than hitherto assumed. Seismicity and stress indicator data, combined with geodetic and geomorphologic observations, demonstrate that the northern Alpine foreland is being actively deformed. This has major implications for the assessment of their natural hazards and environmental degradation. The NW European lithosphere has undergone a polyphase evolution with an intensive interplay of upper mantle thermal perturbations and stress-induced intraplate deformation. A number of recent findings point to an important role of lithospheric folding in thermally weakened lithosphere of the northwestern European foreland.The EU funded interdisciplinary ENvironmental TECtonics research network (ENTEC) addresses relationships between deeper lithospheric processes, neotectonics and surface processes in the northern Alpine foreland. Its objectives are to quantify the effects of ongoing Alpine collision on NW European Foreland intraplate deformation and its impact on surface geomorphology and natural hazards. Three natural laboratories have been selected: (1) the Lower Rhine Graben (LRG), (2) the Upper Rhine Graben (URG), and (3) the Vienna Basin (VB). These three areas record the manifestation of neotectonics within the Alpine orogen (VB), at its front (URG) and in the far field area (LRG).},

However, the evolution of permeability and porosity in rocks can be constrained provided that the processes changing the pore space are known. In this paper, we review observations of the relationship between permeability and porosity during rock evolution and interpret them in terms of creation/destruction of effectively and non-effectively conducting pore space. We focus on laboratory processes, namely, plastic compaction of aggregates, elastic-brittle deformation of granular rocks, dilatant and thermal microcracking of dense rocks, chemically driven processes, as a way to approach naturally occurring geological processes. In particular, the chemically driven processes and their corresponding evolution permeability-porosity relationships are discussed in relation to sedimentary rocks diagenesis.},

abstract = {A 2-D thermohydraulic model for two sites in Switzerland is presented. Geologically both sites belong to Alpine nappe units and consist of generally low permeable rocks with hydraulic conductivities in the range of 10-10-10-8 m s-1. Elevation of topography attains 2.4-3.1 km, and the mountain water table exhibits a correspondingly high relief. The geothermal regime of the area is characterized by relatively high values of measured heat flow on the order of 80-100 mW m-2. The results reveal well developed subsurface fluid circulation systems in both cases. The vertical fluid velocities reach some cm/yr, which is higher by more than one order of magnitude than the flow rates in flat terrain. In mountainous terrain, flow systems may penetrate to depths of 2-3 km below sea level. The discharge zones in areas with high relief and steep slopes are rather narrow and concentrate at and near the valley bottoms. Such zones are the regions of heating where positive disturbances may reach up to 1.5-1.8 times the basal heat flow value. In the recharge areas at ridges, heat flow may in turn become quite low. The calculated thermohydraulic models have been validated by measured temperature distributions in drillholes. Reasonably good agreement between the measured and the calculated temperatures exists for both sites.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the picture that has emerged from several geologic disciplines is that the Earth's crust is permeable to great depths and that fluids are more or less constantly moving, transporting both heat and mass and affecting virtually every geologic process. In contrast, workers in the petroleum industry have maintained that sections of the crust contain impermeable pressure seals and hydraulically sealed compartments. We show that these starkly different conceptions can be reconciled by a theory of self-sealing through gas generation in sedimentary basins. The model especially applies to older sedimentary basins where overpressuring cannot be readily explained as the result of ongoing sedimentation and compaction disequilibrium. In our conceptual model, overpressuring is created by catagenic gas generation and maintained by a combination of vertical and horizontal gas capillary seals. Data from the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma provide support for the self-sealing hypothesis. Well logs reveal the presence of 9 or 10 gas-water interfaces over a 30-m overpressured interval. Capillary pressure measurements show that the force necessary for gas to displace water from a shale is ∼3 × 106 Pa, a pressure equivalent to that exerted by a column of water 300 m high. A theory of self-sealing explains the anomalous overpressuring observed in some older sedimentary basins by invoking known mechanisms and forces; it is both parsimonious and falsifiable.},

abstract = {Field-based geological studies show that continental deformation preferentially occurs in young tectonic provinces rather than in old cratons1. This partitioning of deformation suggests that the cratons are stronger than surrounding younger Phanerozoic provinces. However, although Archaean and Phanerozoic lithosphere differ in their thickness2, 3, 4 and composition4, 5, their relative strength is a matter of much debate. One proxy of strength is the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te. Unfortunately, spatial variations in Te are not well understood, as different methods yield different results. The differences are most apparent in cratons, where the 'Bouguer coherence' method yields large Te values (\textgreater 60 km)6, 7, 8, 9 whereas the 'free-air admittance' method yields low values (\textless 25 km)10. Here we present estimates of the variability of Te in Europe using both methods. We show that when they are consistently formulated11, both methods yield comparable Te values that correlate with geology, and that the strength of old lithosphere ( 1.5 Gyr old) is much larger (mean Te \textgreater 60 km) than that of younger lithosphere (mean Te \textless 30 km). We propose that this strength difference reflects changes in lithospheric plate structure (thickness, geothermal gradient and composition) that result from mantle temperature and volatile content decrease through Earth's history.},

Graben formation started during the Early Triassic and culminated in strong differential subsidence during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. Narrow fault-bounded grabens and troughs and broad intervening highs were formed as a result of crustal distension and associated transtensional deformations. The thickness of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous fill of these basins may have exceeded 3000 m. Concurrent with the filling of these basins the bordering highs became deeply truncated. During the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, compressive stresses resulted in inversion of these basins, whereby movements along their bounding normal faults were reversed, giving rise locally to overthrusting as, for instance, in the Broad Fourteens and West Netherlands basins. The timing of these compressional deformations has been palaeontologically dated and coincides with major orogenic events in the Alps.},

abstract = {The alignment of olivine crystals is considered as the dominant source of seismic anisotropy in the subcrustal lithosphere and asthenosphere. Different components of large-scale anisotropy can be traced in depth distributions of the radial and azimuthal anisotropy of surface waves. We propose a global model of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) as a transition between a `frozen-in' anisotropy in the lithosphere to anisotropy in the sublithospheric mantle related to the present-day flow. Due to different orientations of velocity maxima in the anisotropic subcrustal lithosphere and the asthenosphere, the velocity contrast related to the LAB can increase in particular directions. Because of their long wavelengths and horizontal propagation, surface waves suffer from poor lateral resolution. However, surface waves with various wavelengths allow us to map gross features of the LAB with a good vertical resolution. We estimate depths to the LAB to be between 200 and 250 km for the Precambrian shields and platforms, around 100 km for the Phanerozoic continental regions and 40-70 km beneath oceans from the world-wide depth distribution of the radial and azimuthal anisotropy of surface waves.},

abstract = {A complete Alpine cross section integrates numerous seismic reflection and refraction profiles, across and along strike, with published and new field data. The deepest parts of the profile are constrained by geophysical data only, while structural features at intermediate levels are largely depicted according to the results of three-dimensional models making use of seismic and field geological data. The geometry of the highest structural levels is constrained by classical along-strike projections of field data parallel to the pronounced easterly axial dip of all tectonic units. Because the transect is placed close to the western erosional margin of the Austroalpine nappes of the Eastern Alps, it contains all the major tectonic units of the Alps. A model for the tectonic evolution along the transect is proposed in the form of scaled and area-balanced profile sketches. Shortening within the Austroalpine nappes is testimony of a separate Cretaceous-age orogenic event. West directed thrusting in these units is related to westward propagation of a thrust wedge resulting from continental collision along the Meliata-Hallstatt Ocean further to the east. Considerable amounts of oceanic and continental crustal material were subducted during Tertiary orogeny, which involved some 500 km of N{\^{a}}€“S convergence between Europe and Apulia. Consequently, only a very small percentage of this crustal material is preserved within the nappes depicted in the transect. Postcollisional shortening is characterized by the simultaneous activity of gently dipping north directed detachments and steeply inclined south directed detachments, both detachments nucleating at the interface between lower and upper crust. Large scale wedging of the Adriatic (or Apulian) lower crust into a gap opening between the subduced European lower crust and the pile of thin upper crustal flakes (Alpine nappes) indicates a relatively strong lower crust and detachment between upper and lower crust.},

abstract = {The evolution of an orogen is marked by phases of topographic growth, equilibrium, and decay. During these phases erosion rates vary in response to temporal and spatial changes in climate, topographic relief and slope, and deformation. Detrital thermochronometer cooling-age data collected from syntectonic basin deposits are a promising tool for quantifying erosion histories during orogenic evolution. Previous studies typically assume steady-state erosion for interpreting detrital data, although in many situations this assumption is not justified. Here we present a new numerical modeling approach that predicts thermochronometer cooling ages in a stratigraphic section where sediment is sourced from a region with a temporally variable erosion history. Multiple thermochronometer cooling ages are predicted at different stratigraphic horizons as a function of variable erosion histories, rock cooling rates in the hinterland, and thermophysical material properties and boundary conditions. The modeling approach provides the context for the interpretation of natural data, including geologically realistic situations with a temporally varying erosion rate. The results of three end-member hinterland erosion histories are explored: (1) steady-state erosion; (2) increasing erosion rate with time; and (3) decreasing erosion rate with time. Results indicate that for steady erosion rates between 0.2 and 1.0 mm/yr, up to 30 m.y. will pass following a change in erosion rate before the detrital ages have adjusted to reflect a new erosion regime. In simulations with transient erosion, the estimation of erosion rates from a detrital record using assumption of thermal steady-state will generally be in error, often by as much as - 25 to 100%. These results highlight that assumptions of steady erosion in mountain belts should be used with caution. Application of the model to thermochronometer cooling ages preserved in syntectonic sediments sourced from the Nanga Parbat region, Himalaya, illustrates how the transient catchment averaged erosion history can be quantified with detrital thermochronology. In this example, we found that erosion rates increased over the past 20 Ma, from about 1.0 mm/yr to modern rates in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 mm/yr.},

abstract = {K-Ar age dates of authigenic illite from sandstones in the UK south Central Graben have a bimodal distribution. In contrast to established hypotheses of thermal triggers, this illite growth is explained by changes in hydrogeological history. Fluid motion during burial can hence be dated. Illite growth at 84-58 Ma on the graben margins was coincident with rapid subsidence of the Graben axis and consequent expulsion of pore fluids onto the margins. This event pre-dated both overpressure, and the secondary migration and accumulation of hydrocarbon in the region. Illite growth was probably caused by increased solute transport rates during pore fluid motion. Illite growth on an axial high (33-30 Ma) occurred during overpressured conditions. This was triggered either by: (1) downward fluid migration as a consequence of overpressure release. These fluids carried carboxylic acids or hydrocarbons from the highly overpressured Kimmeridge Clay Formation into the less pressured Fulmar Sandstone Formation; or (2) a decrease in water-rock ratios as fluid flow declined within the sandstones, as a consequence of overpressure build-up. Published experiments show that illite growth is favoured by low water-rock ratios.},

Regional heat flow increases from a value of 66 +/- 4 mW/m2 to the north of Menorca to 88 +/- 4 mW/m2 in the southern part of the rift between Valencia and Ibiza. A simple rifting model, assuming uniform stretching of the lithosphere during a single rifting event from 28 to 22 Ma ago, satisfactorily describes the observed heat flow and depth to sea floor in the northern part of the trough. In contrast, the southern Valencia trough has high heat flow and shallow sea floor that are difficult to reconcile with predictions of a uniform lithospheric stretching model even allowing for an initial elevation, a thin, hot lithosphere or a multi-episode history of rifting. Non-homogeneous lithospheric stretching models, assuming for example large-scale dike intrusion or a greater extension of the mantle than in the crust, provide potential explanations of the high heat flow and shallow sea floor in the southern Valencia trough. Yet, these models remain poorly constrained.},

abstract = {Abstract The Westphalian C and D fluvial sandstones in the Campine Basin (north-east Belgium) are potential reservoirs for the sequestration of CO2 and interesting analogues of the hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Southern North Sea. Although these sandstones were deposited in a relatively short period of time, their reservoir properties and mineralogical compositions are very different. A petrographic study complemented with stable isotope analyses, fluid inclusion microthermometry and X-ray diffraction analyses of the clay fractions of the sandstones, which were sampled from deep boreholes (\textgreater1000 m) in the Campine Basin, revealed that these differences are related mainly to the climate at the time of deposition. The most important eogenetic processes affecting the Westphalian sandstones were the generation of a pseudomatrix by physical compaction of Al-silicates and lithic fragments that were strongly altered by extensive meteoric leaching, kaolinitization of unstable silicates and precipitation of siderite. These processes had a detrimental influence on the reservoir properties of Westphalian C sandstones, but their impact on the Westphalian D sandstones was minimal. The difference is assumed to be related to the climate at the time of deposition, which changed from tropical humid in the Westphalian C to semi-arid/arid during the Late Westphalian D. Both the Westphalian C and D sandstones were affected by similar mesogenetic processes. Mesogenetic quartz cementation resulted from chemical compaction and illitization of kaolinite, K-feldspar and smectitic clays. Illitization of kaolinite was controlled by the available quantities of co-existing kaolinite and K-feldspar and mainly affected the Westphalian D sandstones. Illitization of K-feldspar was controlled by the K-feldspar content. It had a much larger impact on the reservoir properties of the Westphalian D as, in these sandstones, K-feldspar was less affected by eogenetic alteration. The illitization of smectitic clays resulted in illite, quartz and ankerite cementation in both reservoirs. This process had a more important impact on the Westphalian C reservoir, since cementation here also resulted from smectite to illite conversion in the interbedded and underlying shales. The effect of mesogenetic alterations on the reservoir properties was much less drastic than the impact of eodiagenesis. Mesogenetic alterations do exert a significant control on the properties of the Westphalian D. The vast impact of eodiagenesis on the Westphalian C sandstones made them less susceptible to mesogenetic alteration. The effect of telogenetic processes on the porosity and permeability of the Westphalian sandstones was small and restricted to the top reservoir intervals that directly underlie the Cimmerian Unconformity. No significant telogenetic alterations related to the Variscan Unconformity were observed.},

Geostatistical simulations were used to extrapolate the measured data over an 800 &#215; 100 m area and develop a high-resolution image of temperatures in the fault. On the basis of the modeled temperatures, a simple analytical model of convective heat transport was used to infer a probability distribution function for hydraulic conductivities in a two-dimensional plane parallel to the land surface, and the partitioning of flow between flow paths of different conductivities was calculated as a fraction of the total flux. The analysis demonstrates the existence of spatially discrete, high-permeability flow paths within the predominantly lower-permeability fault materials. Although the existence of fast-flow paths in faults has been hypothesized for &#62;10 yr, their prevalence and contribution to the total flow of fluid in a fault zone are debated. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the flux transmitted by an individual fast-flow path is significantly greater than that of an average flow path, but the total flux transported in fast-flow paths is a negligible fraction of the total flux transmitted by the fault.},

abstract = {Fluvial sandstones are an important reservoir type for the petroleum industry. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, large hydrocarbon discoveries in the Norwegian North Sea in fluvial strata prompted the need for generating geologically meaningful, stochastic, object-based models of fluvial deposits. The aim of this focus was to allow the geologist to provide the reservoir engineers with a more realistic representation of permeability contrasts within channelised, fluvial deposits by being able to use appropriate measurements from outcrop analogues as direct input data into the modelling software. This initiative resulted in the development of a suite of geologically driven, stochastic modelling algorithms supported by an extensive fieldwork program aimed at collecting stratigraphic and quantitative data from ancient outcrop analogues to support enhanced reservoir characterisation and geological modelling. Today, these reservoirs are still important hydrocarbon producing fields with accurate reservoir description and 3D modelling capabilities playing a vital role in targeting remaining oil, especially now that many of the fields on the Norwegian continental shelf are past peak production and are in a decline phase. As both computing capabilities and quantitative outcrop analogue studies have increased the understanding of, and the ability to model fluvial reservoirs, so have stochastic modelling techniques continued to provide the most suitable and robust means of building geologically realistic 3D reservoir models that incorporate increased geological understanding and heterogeneity complexity. In the recent past, a multitude of data, such as seismic and production data have been used to condition the stochastic algorithms. This review paper aims to outline the role of stochastic algorithms in building geologically-realistic, 3D fluvial reservoir models and highlight the success of these developments with case studies from both producing fields and ancient outcrop analogue studies. Finally, the paper will allude to possible improvements in stochastic fluvial modelling and future directions in the modelling of fluvial petroleum reservoirs. These include the use of physical or process-based models, high-resolution near wellbore models, and multi-point statistics, that allow for more realistic representations of heterogeneities of fluvial deposits at a variety of scales and by a variety of methods.},

abstract = {Constraints on the structure of rifted continental margins and the
magmatism resulting from such rifting can help refine our understanding
of the strength of the lithosphere, the state of the underlying mantle
and the transition from rifting to seafloor spreading. An important
structural classification of rifts is by width(1), with narrow rifts
thought to form as necking instabilities(2) ( where extension rates
outpace thermal diffusion(3)) and wide rifts thought to require a
mechanism to inhibit localization, such as lower-crustal flow in high
heat-flow settings(1,4). Observations of the magmatism that results
from rifting range from volcanic margins with two to three times the
magmatism predicted from melting models(5) to non-volcanic margins with
almost no rift or post-rift magmatism. Such variations in magmatic
activity are commonly attributed to variations in mantle temperature.
Here we describe results from the PESCADOR seismic experiment in the
southern Gulf of California and present crustal-scale images across
three rift segments. Over short lateral distances, we observe large
differences in rifting style and magmatism - from wide rifting with
minor synchronous magmatism to narrow rifting in magmatically robust
segments. But many of the factors believed to control structural
evolution and magmatism during rifting ( extension rate, mantle
potential temperature and heat flow) tend to vary over larger length
scales. We conclude instead that mantle depletion, rather than low
mantle temperature, accounts for the observed wide, magma-poor margins,
and that mantle fertility and possibly sedimentary insulation, rather
than high mantle temperature, account for the observed robust rift and
post-rift magmatism.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 1142013131 At many subduction zones, accretionary complexes form as sediments are offscraped from the subducting plate, and excess pore pressures commonly develop as low-permeability marine sediments undergo rapid tectonically driven loading. Mechanical models demonstrate that pore pressure controls the overall geometry of these systems by modifying shear strength both within the accretionary wedge and along its base. At the Nankai margin offshore SW Japan, the taper angle of the accretionary wedge varies markedly along-strike, from 223C4� along an eastern (Muroto) transect, to 8201310�along a western (Ashizuri) transect. Sediment stratigraphy on the subducting plate also varies: along the Ashizuri transect, the lowermost part of the section includes abundant sandy turbidites, whereas along the Muroto transect it is composed of monotonous hemipelagic mudstone. Here, I use a numerical model of fluid flow, together with laboratory measurements that constrain the bulk mudstone permeability, to quantitatively test the hypothesis that the turbidite-rich section along the Ashizuri transect allows drainage at the base of the accretionary complex, resulting in differences in mechanical strength sufficient to cause the differences in taper angle. My results demonstrate that if the turbidite-rich units are 22013100 times more permeable than the mudstone units, the variation in stratigraphy can indeed explain the observed taper angles. In contrast, permeability anisotropy within the turbidite-rich units has only a minor effect; anisotropy ratios of 223C1000:1 would be required to cause the differences in taper angle. Along the Ashizuri transect, simulated pore pressures result in a basal shear strength ranging from a few MPa at the trench to 223C20�MPa by 30�km arcward; along the Muroto transect shear strength is substantially lower, reaching only 223C5�MPa by 30�km. This work shows that lithostratigraphy can strongly influence the mechanical behavior of subduction zone faults, through its control on the distribution and magnitude of excess pore pressure.},

abstract = {The Rhine Rift System (RRS) forms part of the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) and transects the Variscan Orogen, Permo-Carboniferous troughs and Late Permian to Mesozoic thermal sag basins. Crustal and lithospheric thicknesses range in the RRS area between 24–36 km and 50–120 km, respectively. We discuss processes controlling the transformation of the orogenically destabilised Variscan lithosphere into an end-Mesozoic stabilised cratonic lithosphere, as well as its renewed destabilisation during the Cenozoic development of ECRIS. By end-Westphalian times, the major sutures of the Variscan Orogen were associated with 45–60 km deep crustal roots. During the Stephanian-Early Permian, regional exhumation of the Variscides was controlled by their wrench deformation, detachment of subducted lithospheric slabs, asthenospheric upwelling and thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere. By late Early Permian times, when asthenospheric temperatures returned to ambient levels, lithospheric thicknesses ranged between 40 km and 80 km, whilst the thickness of the crust was reduced to 28–35 km in response to its regional erosional and local tectonic unroofing and the interaction of mantle-derived melts with its basal parts. Re-equilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system governed the subsidence of Late Permian-Mesozoic thermal sag basins that covered much of the RRS area. By end-Cretaceous times, lithospheric thicknesses had increased to 100–120 km. Paleocene mantle plumes caused renewed thermal weakening of the lithosphere. Starting in the late Eocene, ECRIS evolved in the Pyrenean and Alpine foreland by passive rifting under a collision-related north-directed compressional stress field. Following end-Oligocene consolidation of the Pyrenees, west- and northwest-directed stresses originating in the Alps controlled further development of ECRIS. The RRS remained active until the Present, whilst the southern branch of ECRIS aborted in the early Miocene. Extensional strain across ECRIS amounts to some 7 km. Plume-related thermal thinning of the lithosphere underlies uplift of the Rhenish Massif and Massif Central. Lithospheric folding controlled uplift of the Vosges-Black Forest Arch.},

abstract = {Earthquakes and vertical land movements inferred from geodetic levelling results demonstrate that the Netherlands is situated on a tectonically active part of the Earth's surface. Tectonic subsidence analyses of the sedimentary records in the basins and the history of tectonic uplift inferred from Meuse river terraces show that the current tectonic activity is part of a deformation phase which began in the late Early Miocene, which we take as the start of the neotectonic period. The neotectonic faulting mode is normal-slip. This is in accordance with the present-day orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, and the vertical orientation of the maximum stress. However, the neotectonic fault zones are reactivated Variscan or older wrench faults. These faults have been reactivated repeatedly during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic in normal and wrenching modes, and therefore represent fundamental crustal weakness zones. As a result, the surficial neotectonic fault pattern resembles the inherited wrenching fault pattern, although the faulting mode is normal-slip. This is illustrated for the area where normal faults have displaced the Meuse fluvial terrace system in the southeastern part of the Netherlands.The neotectonic vertical motions in and around the Roer Valley Rift System have affected the courses of the Rhine and Meuse rivers from Pliocene times until the present. In addition, a fluvial terrace staircase developed along the Meuse river in response to the uplift of the Ardennes-Rhenish Massif and its foreland, for example near Maastricht. Furthermore, small fault scarps are present along segments of the bounding fault zones of the Roer Valley Graben: the Peel Boundary Fault Zone and the Feldbiss Fault Zone. In other parts of the Netherlands the neotectonic vertical motions have no direct expression in the morphology. Examples of possible indirect control on the morphology in these areas occur in glacial landscapes, the Zuiderzee Basin and the coastal zone.},

In reality, heat from radiogenic sources within the lithosphere, especially in the upper crust, may represent more than half the heat flow at the top of basement. Thinning of the lithosphere during extension does indeed result in an increase of heat flowing from the asthenosphere, but this thinning also reduces the radiogenic heat from within the lithosphere. Because these two effects cancel to a large degree, the direct effects of lithospheric extension on heat flow at the top of basement are smaller than those predicted by the McKenzie model. Because of permanent loss of radiogenic material by lithospheric thinning, the heat flow at the top of basement long after rifting will be lower than the pre-rift heat flow.},

Temperature measurements can be analyzed for recharge and discharge rates, the effects of surface warming, interchange with surface water, hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments, and basin-scale permeability. Temperature data are also used in formal solutions of the inverse problem to estimate ground water flow and hydraulic conductivity. The fundamentals of using heat as a ground water tracer were published in the 1960s, but recent work has significantly expanded the application to a variety of hydrogeological settings. In recent work, temperature is used to delineate flows in the hyporheic zone, estimate submarine ground water discharge and depth to the salt-water interface, and in parameter estimation with coupled ground water and heat-flow models. While short reviews of selected work on heat as a ground water tracer can be found in a number of research papers, there is no critical synthesis of the larger body of work found in the hydrogeological literature. The purpose of this review paper is to fill that void and to show that ground water temperature data and associated analytical tools are currently underused and have not yet realized their full potential.},

abstract = {Studies on the compatibility of Boom Clay with large amounts of nitrate- bearing bituminized radioactive waste have recently raised a particular interest for osmosis-induced effects in this reference formation in Belgium. Indeed, water flow and solute transport may be associated with several types of driving forces, or gradients (chemical, electrical, thermal), in addition to the hydraulic forces, resulting in the so-called coupled flows. Fluid flow caused by driving forces different than hydraulic gradients is referred to as osmosis. Chemical osmosis, the water flow induced by a chemical gradient across a semi-permeable membrane, can generate pressure increase. The question thus arises if there is a risk to create high pore pressures that could damage the near-field of medium-level waste (MLW) galleries, if osmotically driven water flows towards the galleries are produced by the release of large amounts of NaNO3 (750 t) in the formation. To what extent a low-permeability clay formation such as the Boom Clay acts as an osmotic membrane is thus a key issue to assess the relevance of osmosis phenomena for the disposal of medium-level waste. An in situ osmosis experiment has been conducted at the Hades underground research laboratory to determine the osmotic efficiency of Boom Clay at the field scale. A recently developed chemical osmosis flow continuum model has been used to design the osmosis experiment, and to interpret the water pressure measurements. Experimental data could be reproduced quite accurately by the model, and the inferred parameter values are consistent with independent determinations for Boom Clay. A rapid water pressure increase (but limited to about a 2 m water column) was observed after 12 h in the filter containing the more saline water. Then, the osmotically induced water pressure slowly decays on several months. So, the experimental results obtained in situ confirm the occurrence of non-hydraulic flow phenomena (chemical osmosis) in a low-permeability plastic formation such as the Boom Clay. The osmotic efficiency of Boom Clay is high under undisturbed chemical conditions ([sigma] = 0.41 at 0.014 M NaHCO3), but rapidly decreases when the dissolved salts concentration increases ([sigma] = 0.07 at 0.14 M NaHCO3). A semi-permeable membrane behaviour of the Boom Clay (high efficiencies) may be expected for the disposal of nitrate-bearing radioactive waste. However, the presently observed osmotically induced pressure is too low to have a significant mechanical impact on the host rock. Finally, the short duration of the osmosis test performed suggests that the shut-in test method used is effective for osmosis testing.},

abstract = {Hydrologic changes associated with the 17 January 1995 Kobe Earthquake occurred in Awajishima Island very close to the epicenter. These included: (1) large drop of water table in the mountainous area; (2) rapid increase of discharge along active faults; and (3) change of chemistry of discharged water. A simple horizontal flow model was constructed to explain the observed changes; and optimal sets of specific yield and the change of hydraulic conductivity were estimated. Results suggest that this model can explain the observed phenomena consistently. The hydraulic conductivity is estimated to increase at least five times than that before the Earthquake; however, quantitative measurement of the increase of discharge just after the earthquake would constrain better the change of the hydraulic conductivity. The specific yield of the unconfined aquifer is between 0.3 and 1.7% depending on the assumed recharge rate but independent of the assumed depth to the impermeable basement. The change in chemical composition of the discharged water could be explained by the upward movement of deeper water due to the invasion of saltwater into the aquifer.},

abstract = {Variations in rock magnetic properties are responsible for the many linear, short-wavelength, low-amplitude magnetic anomalies that are spatially associated with faults that cut Neogene basin sediments in the Rio Grande rift, including the San Ysidro normal fault, which is well exposed in the northern part of the Albuquerque Basin. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements from 310 sites distributed through a 1200-m-thick composite section of rift-filling sediments of the Santa Fe Group and prerift Eocene and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks document large variations of magnetic properties juxtaposed by the San Ysidro fault. Mean volume magnetic susceptibilities generally increase upsection through eight map units: from 1.7 to 2.2E-4 in the prerift Eocene and Cretaceous rocks to 9.9E-4–1.2E-3 in three members of the Miocene Zia Formation of the Santa Fe Group to 1.5E-3–3.5E-3 in three members of the Miocene–Pleistocene Arroyo Ojito Formation of the Santa Fe Group. Rock magnetic measurements and petrography indicate that the amount of detrital magnetite and its variable oxidation to maghemite and hematite within the Santa Fe Group sediments are the predominant controls of their magnetic property variations. Magnetic susceptibility increases progressively with sediment grain size within the members of the Arroyo Ojito Formation (deposited in fluvial environments) but within members of the Zia Formation (deposited in mostly eolian environments) reaches highest values in fine to medium sands. Partial oxidation of detrital magnetite is spatially associated with calcite cementation in the Santa Fe Group. Both oxidation and cementation probably reflect past flow of groundwater through permeable zones. Magnetic models for geologic cross sections that incorporate mean magnetic susceptibilities for the different stratigraphic units mimic the aeromagnetic profiles across the San Ysidro fault and demonstrate that the stratigraphic level of dominant magnetic contrast changes with different exposure levels into the fault. These data indicate that tectonic juxtaposition of primary variations of magnetic properties of strata across the fault is the source of the associated magnetic anomaly. This study indicates that magnetic anomalies over faults and folds can be generated by sediments (1) deposited within tectonic basins having volcanic or basement source areas rich in magnetite, (2) having depositional environments with sufficient but varying energy to transport dense magnetic minerals and cause stratigraphic changes of magnetic properties, and (3) having magnetic minerals preserved owing to their youth or nonreactive geochemical environments.},

abstract = {The San Ysidro fault is a spectacularly exposed normal fault located in the northwestern Albuquerque Basin of the Rio Grande Rift. This intrabasin fault is representative of many faults that formed in poorly lithified sediments throughout the rift. The fault is exposed over nearly 10 km and accommodates nearly 700 m of dip slip in subhorizontal, siliciclastic sediments. The extent of the exposure facilitates study of along-strike variations in deformation mechanisms, architecture, geochemistry, and permeability. The fault is composed of structural and hydrogeologic components that include a clay-rich fault core, a calcite-cemented mixed zone, and a poorly developed damage zone primarily consisting of deformation bands. Structural textures suggest that initial deformation in the fault occurred at low temperature and pressure, was within the paleosaturated zone of the evolving Rio Grande Rift, and was dominated by particulate flow. Little geochemical change is apparent across the fault zone other than due to secondary processes. The lack of fault-related geochemical change is interpreted to reflect the fundamental nature of water-saturated, particulate flow. Early mechanical entrainment of low-permeability clays into the fault core likely caused damming of groundwater flow on the up-gradient, footwall side of the fault. This may have caused a pressure gradient and flow of calcite-saturated waters in higher-permeability, fault-entrained siliciclastic sediments, ultimately promoting their cementation by sparry calcite. Once developed, the cemented and clay-rich fault has likely been, and continues to be, a partial barrier to cross-fault groundwater flow, as suggested by petrophysical measurements. Aeromagnetic data indicate that there may be many more unmapped faults with similar lengths to the San Ysidro fault buried within Rio Grande basins. If these buried faults formed by the same processes that formed the San Ysidro fault and have persistent low-permeability cores and cemented mixed zones, they could compartmentalize the basin-fill aquifers more than is currently realized, particularly if pumping stresses continue to increase in response to population growth.},

abstract = {We compare heat flow data from the Precambrian shields in North America and in South Africa. We also review data available in other less well-sampled Shield regions. Variations in crustal heat production account for most of the variability of the heat flow. Because of this variability, it is difficult to define a single average crustal model representative of a whole tectonic province. The average heat flow values of different Archean provinces in Canada, South Africa, Australia and India differ by significant amounts. This is also true for Proterozoic provinces. For example, the heat flow is significantly higher in the Proterozoic Namaqua-Natal Belt of South Africa than in the Grenville Province of the Canadian Shield (61 vs. 41 mW m-2 on average). These observations indicate that it is not possible to define single value of the average heat flow for all provinces of the same crustal age. Large amplitude short wavelength variations of the heat flow suggest that most of the difference between Proterozoic and Archean heat flow is of crustal origin. In eastern Canada, there is no good correlation between the local values of heat flow and heat production. In the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces of eastern Canada, heat flow values through rocks with the same heat production are not significantly different. There is therefore no evidence for variations of the mantle heat flow beneath these different provinces. After removing the local crustal heat production from the surface heat flow, the mantle (Moho) heat flow was estimated to be between 10-15 mW m-2 in the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces of eastern Canada. Estimates of the mantle heat flow in the Kaapvaal craton of South Africa may be slightly higher ([approximate]17 mW m-2). Large-scale variations of bulk crustal heat production are well-documented in Canada and imply significant differences of deep lithospheric thermal structure. In thick lithosphere, surficial heat flow measurements record a time average of heat production in the lithospheric mantle and are not in equilibrium with the instantaneous heat production. The low mantle heat flow and current estimates of heat production in the lithospheric mantle do not support a mechanical (conductive) lithosphere thinner than 200 km and thicker than 330 km. Temperature anomalies with surrounding oceanic mantle extend to the convective boundary layer below the conductive layer, and hence to depths greater than these estimates. Mechanical and thermal stability of the lithosphere require the mantle part of the lithosphere to be chemically buoyant and depleted in radiogenic elements. Both characteristics are achieved simultaneously by partial melting and melt extraction.},

Where the reservoir is lithologically homogeneous illite precipitation proceeded systematically base-upwards at rates of 5.5 m Ma-1. The duration of illite formation at any one level was between 2 and 8 Ma. In contrast, in heterolithic reservoirs fluid migration occurred initially along high permeability fairways and consequently illite ages do not vary systematically with depth.},

abstract = {Free thermal convection and mixed convection are considered as potential mechanisms for mass and heat transport in sedimentary basins. Mixed convection occurs when horizontal flows (forced convection) are superimposed on thermally driven flows. In cross section, mixed convection is characterized by convection cells that migrate laterally in the direction of forced convective flow. Two-dimensional finite-element simulations of variable-density groundwater flow and heat transport in a horizontal porous layer were performed to determine critical mean Rayleigh numbers for the onset of free convection, using both isothermal and semi-conductive boundaries. Additional simulations imposed a varying lateral fluid flux on the free-convection pattern. Results from these experiments indicate that forced convection becomes dominant, completely eliminating buoyancy-driven circulation, when the total forced-convection fluid flux exceeds the total flux possible due to free convection. Calculations of the thermal rock alteration index (RAI=q&#183;&#111T) delineate the patterns of potential diagenesis produced by fluid movement through temperature gradients. Free convection produces a distinct pattern of alternating positive and negative RAIs, whereas mixed convection produces a simpler layering of positive and negative values and in general less diagenetic alteration.

abstract = {Mathematical modeling is used in this study to assess how tectonic movement of fault blocks and fault permeability influence the present-day and paleohydrogeology of the Rio Grande Rift near Socorro, New Mexico. Our analysis focuses on active and ancient groundwater flow patterns and hot spring development within the southern La Jencia and Socorro subbasins. The best agreement between model results and present-day and paleoheat flow data was achieved by representing faults as passive surfaces and incorporating 2 km of moderately permeable (10 -14.0 m 2) fractured crystalline rocks into the hydrogeologic model. Quantitative results indicate that changes in groundwater flow patterns across the basin are primarily generated by the truncation/reconnection of aquifers and confining units. Calculated flow patterns help to explain the annealing of apatite fission tracks within Eocene Baca Formation clasts to the east of Socorro, potassium metasomatism mass balance constraints within Oligocene volcanics and overlying Santa Fe Group deposits, and the timing of barite/fluorite ore mineralization within the Gonzales prospect on the eastern edge of the Rio Grande Rift. We estimate that about 5% of mountain front recharge penetrates to a depth of 2.8 km below the sedimentary pile. This may have implications for water resource planners who have historically focused on groundwater resource development within the shallow alluvial deposits along the Rio Grande Rift valley.},

abstract = {Temperature is one of the key parameters controlling lithospheric and mantle dynamics and rheology. Using recent experimental data on elastic parameters and anelasticity, we obtain models of temperature at 50 to 200 km depth beneath Europe from the global P wave velocity model of Bijwaard et al. [1998] and the regional S wave velocity model of Marquering and Snieder [1996]. Forward modeling of seismic velocity allows us to assess the sensitivity of velocity to various parameters. In the depth range of interest, variations in temperature (when below the solidus) yield the largest effects. For a 100 °C increase in temperature, a decrease of 0.5–2% in VP and 0.7–4.5% in VS is predicted, where the strongest decrease is due to the large effect of anelasticity at high temperature. The effect of composition is expected to give velocity anomalies \textless1% for the shallow mantle and would therefore be difficult to resolve. At depths \textgreater80 km the relative amplitudes of the European VP and VS anomalies are consistent with a thermal origin. At shallower depths, variations in crustal thickness and possibly the presence of partial melt appear to have an additional effect, mainly on S wave velocity. In regions where both P and S anomalies are well-resolved, VP- and VS-derived thermal models agree well with each other and with temperatures determined from surface heat flow observations. Furthermore, the thermal models are consistent with known tectonics. The inferred temperatures vary significantly, from around 400 °C below an average mantle adiabat at 100 km depth under the Russian Platform and a 300 °C increase from east to west across the Tornquist-Teisseyre zone to temperatures around the mantle adiabat in the depth range 50–200 km under areas with present surface volcanism. In spite of the uncertainties in the calculation of temperatures due to uncertainties in the experimental elastic parameters and anelasticity and uncertainties associated with tomographic imaging, we find that the tomographic models of the shallow mantle under Europe can yield useful estimates of the thermal structure.},

abstract = {A procedure has been devised for predicting the fluid pressures in a sedimentary basin from the distribution of different rock types, and their burial rates. We have calibrated the procedure with case histories from the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Norway and Nile Delta. We show how the procedure is useful for making estimates of the fluid pressures likely to be encountered when drilling a well; the directions of petroleum migration; and the ability of structures to retain oil or gas. The procedure is based on a simple equation which accounts only for the vertical flow of fluids. To include lateral flow, laterally-continuous high permeability layers, such as oil and gas reservoir rocks and aquifers, must be divided into pressure cells. A pressure cell is a part of the layer within which fluids can flow and equalize excess pressures (or overpressures). The fluids of all rocks within the cell are maintained at a nearly constant overpressure (actual pressure minus hydrostatic pressure). Pressure cells which crop out at, or come close to, the surface tend to have very low overpressures, because any excess pressures are dissipated by flow of fluids through the cell to the surface. Deeper pressure cells without a high permeability connection either to the surface or to the shallowest 2 km of sediments tend to be overpressured. The shallower parts of these overpressured cells have higher overpressures than the overlying low permeability rocks. This situation can prevent an accumulation of oil or gas forming. The deeper parts of the same cells have lower overpressures than the overlying permeability rocks, and hence are more likely to contain accumulations of oil and gas.},

abstract = {The Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) is located between the West European rift and the North Sea rift system. During the Cenozoic, the RVRS was characterized by several periods of subsidence and inversion, which are linked to the evolution of the adjacent rift systems. Combination of subsidence analysis and results from the analysis of thickness distributions and fault systems allows the determination of the Cenozoic evolution and quantification of the subsidence. During the Early Paleocene, the RVRS was inverted (Laramide phase). The backstripping method shows that the RVRS was subsequently mainly affected by two periods of subsidence, during the Late Paleocene and the Oligocene-Quaternary time intervals, separated by an inversion phase during the Late Eocene. During the Oligocene and Miocene periods, the thickness of the sediments and the distribution of the active faults reveal a radical rotation of the direction of extension by about 70-80[deg] (counter clockwise). Integration of these results at a European scale indicates that the Late Paleocene subsidence was related to the evolution of the North Sea basins, whereas the Oligocene-Quaternary subsidence is connected to the West European rift evolution. The distribution of the inverted provinces also shows that the Early Paleocene inversion (Laramide phase) has affected the whole European crust, whereas the Late Eocene inversion was restricted to the southern North Sea basins and the Channel area. Finally, comparison of these deformations in the European crust with the evolution of the Alpine chain suggests that the formation of the Alps has controlled the evolution of the European crust since the beginning of the Cenozoic.},

Based on fluid inclusion and stable isotope characteristics, these deposits have been attributed to upward flow of formation water and hydrocarbons. The present study sought to test this hypothesis by using numerical reactive transport modeling to investigate the origin of calcite cements in the Refugio-Carneros fault located on the northern flank of the Santa Barbara Basin of southern California. Previous research has shown this calcite to have low 03B413C values of about 221240 to 2212302030PDB, suggesting that methane-rich fluids ascended the fault and contributed carbon for the mineralization. Fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of 802013125�C in the calcite indicate that the fluids also transported significant quantities of heat. Fluid inclusion salinities ranging from fresh water to seawater values and the proximity of the Refugio-Carneros fault to a zone of groundwater recharge in the Santa Ynez Mountains suggest that calcite precipitation in the fault may have been induced by the oxidation of methane-rich basinal fluids by infiltrating meteoric fluids descending steeply dipping sedimentary layers on the northern basin flank. This oxidation could have occurred via at least two different mixing scenarios. In the first, overpressures in the central part of the basin may have driven methane-rich formation waters derived from the Monterey Formation northward toward the basin flanks where they mixed with meteoric water descending from the Santa Ynez Mountains and diverted upward through the Refugio-Carneros fault. In the second scenario, methane-rich fluids sourced from deeper Paleogene sediments would have been driven upward by overpressures generated in the fault zones because of deformation, pressure solution, and flow, and released during fault rupture, ultimately mixing with meteoric water at shallow depth. The models in the present study were designed to test this second scenario, and show that in order for the observed fluid inclusion temperatures to be reached within 200�m of the surface, moderate overpressures and high permeabilities were required in the fault zone. Sudden release of overpressure may have been triggered by earthquakes and led to transient pulses of accelerated fluid flow and heat transport along faults, most likely on the order of tens to hundreds of years in duration. While the models also showed that methane-rich fluids ascending the Refugio-Carneros fault could be oxidized by meteoric water traversing the Vaqueros Sandstone to form calcite, they raised doubts about whether the length of time and the number of fault pulses needed for mineralization by the fault overpressuring mechanism were too high given existing geologic constraints.},

abstract = {It is well known that significant corrections to measured heat-flow values are required in limited areas that have been subjected to the advance and retreat of ice sheets. However, important activities such as the Wisconsin glacial cycle must have been accompanied by temperature changes of global extent. Therefore, even those continental areas that were not subject to glaciation may have suffered important mean surface temperature changes, thus leading to the need to correct heat-flow measurements made in such areas. Furthermore, there have been significant widespread changes in climate during the Holocene, leading to a need to correct for short-term temperature changes as well. Applying corrections to existing data for a surface thermal history of the Holocene and Pleistocene, it is found that correlation between heat-flow values and borehole depths are significantly reduced, that both positive and negative correlations of heat flow with conductivity may be due to neglect of climatic corrections, and that many heat-flow values, particularly from shallow holes (less than 400 meters deep), may need corrections of several tenths of a heat-flow unit (several mW m-2). It is concluded that mean heat-flow values for heat-flow provinces, and continents as a whole, may be too low by as much as 20 or 30% and that the mean oceanic and continental heat-flow values may not be equal.},

@article{Zhao2007,
abstract = {This article is concerned with chemical reactions that occur between two interacting parallel fluid flows using mixing in vertical faults as an example. Mineral precipitation associated with fluid flow in permeable fault zones results in mineralization and chemical reaction (alteration) patterns, which in turn are strongly dependent on interactions between solute advection (controlled by fluid flow rates), solute diffusion/dispersion and chemical kinetics. These interactions can be understood by simultaneously considering two dimensionless numbers, the Damk�hler number and the Z-number. The Damk�hler number expresses the interaction between solute advection (flow rate) and chemical kinetics, while the Z-number expresses the interaction between solute diffusion/dispersion and chemical kinetics. Based on the Damk�hler and Z-numbers, two chemical equilibrium length-scales are defined, dominated by either solute advection or by solute diffusion/dispersion. For a permeable vertical fault zone and for a given solute diffusion/dispersion coefficient, there exist three possible types of chemical reaction patterns, depending on both the flow rate and the chemical reaction rate. These three types are: (i) those dominated by solute diffusion and dispersion resulting in precipitation at the lower tip of a vertical fault and as a thin sliver within the fault, (ii) those dominated by solute advection resulting in precipitation at or above the upper tip of the fault, and (iii) those in which advection and diffusion/dispersion play similar roles resulting in wide mineralization within the fault. Theoretical analysis indicates that there exists both an optimal flow rate and an optimal chemical reaction rate, such that chemical equilibrium following focusing and mixing of two fluids may be attained within the fault zone (i.e. type 3). However, for rapid and parallel flows, such as those resulting from a lithostatic pressure gradient, it is difficult for a chemical reaction to reach equilibrium within the fault zone, if the two fluids are not well mixed before entering the fault zone. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the three possible types of chemical reaction patterns.},

abstract = {The pattern of fault reactivation, basin deformation and concentration of seismicity along the main trans-Netherlands fault zone, located NW-SE across the centre of the Netherlands, indicates that this zone is a major zone of weakness. Gravity modelling reveals after back-stripping of the sedimentary succession a distinctive continuous positive anomaly that can be explained by lithospheric sources. This zone of weakness is therefore likely to have a major influence on the tectonic processes currently active in the Netherlands region. We give a review of the tectonic history of the Netherlands and then present the results of a quantitative study of the reactivation of basin boundary faults and the influence on the surrounding basin. Well-data, balanced and back-stripped cross-sections are used to constrain the lithosphere rheology. The lithosphere rheology modelling results show a weak coupling between upper crustal deformation and the subcrustal lithosphere. A finite element modelling approach focussing on the upper crust is carried out in which the basin boundary faults are assigned various dips. The modelling results indicate that, for continuous reactivation of basin boundary faults, the presence of both a pre-existing weakness and a reduced friction angle is required. The latter implies that large displacements accommodated by primary faults cannot be directly attributed to the relative weakness of these faults compared to the secondary faults, which is in close accordance with inferences from trenching. A reduced friction angle has a significant effect on lithospheric strength and appears to be the major controlling factor in the reactivation of basin boundary faults.},

abstract = {The evolution of the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) and the Alpine orogen is discussed on the base of a set of palaeotectonic maps and two retro-deformed lithospheric transects which extend across the Western and Central Alps and the Massif Central and the Rhenish Massif, respectively. During the Paleocene, compressional stresses exerted on continental Europe by the evolving Alps and Pyrenees caused lithospheric buckling and basin inversion up to 1700 km to the north of the Alpine and Pyrenean deformation fronts. This deformation was accompanied by the injection of melilite dykes, reflecting a plume-related increase in the temperature of the asthenosphere beneath the European foreland. At the Paleocene-Eocene transition, compressional stresses relaxed in the Alpine foreland, whereas collisional interaction of the Pyrenees with their foreland persisted. In the Alps, major Eocene north-directed lithospheric shortening was followed by mid-Eocene slab- and thrust-loaded subsidence of the Dauphinois and Helvetic shelves. During the late Eocene, north-directed compressional intraplate stresses originating in the Alpine and Pyrenean collision zones built up and activated ECRIS. At the Eocene-Oligocene transition, the subducted Central Alpine slab was detached, whereas the West-Alpine slab remained attached to the lithosphere. Subsequently, the Alpine orogenic wedge converged northwestward with its foreland. The Oligocene main rifting phase of ECRIS was controlled by north-directed compressional stresses originating in the Pyrenean and Alpine collision zones. Following early Miocene termination of crustal shortening in the Pyrenees and opening of the oceanic Proven{\c{c}}al Basin, the evolution of ECRIS was exclusively controlled by west- and northwest-directed compressional stresses emanating from the Alps during imbrication of their external massifs. Whereas the grabens of the Massif Central and the Rh{\^{o}}ne Valley became inactive during the early Miocene, the Rhine Rift System remained active until the present. Lithospheric folding controlled mid-Miocene and Pliocene uplift of the Vosges-Black Forest Arch. Progressive uplift of the Rhenish Massif and Massif Central is mainly attributed to plume-related thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere. ECRIS evolved by passive rifting in response to the build-up of Pyrenean and Alpine collision-related compressional intraplate stresses. Mantle-plume-type upwelling of the asthenosphere caused thermal weakening of the foreland lithosphere, rendering it prone to deformation.},

abstract = {Geophysical data generally support the presence of free aqueous fluids in the crust to at least the depth of the 700-750[deg]C isotherm, where granulite facies conditions are reached, which are presumed to have no free water. The fluid phase distribution and transport of fluid in rocks strongly depend on the rheological conditions. In the lithologically heterogeneous crust changes in rheological regime can produce quite complex sandwich-like fluid transport layering, including domains of upward migration, very impermeable layers, or thin reservoirs with nearly horizontal fluid transport.In the present study two, two-dimensional thermal models of the stable continental crust with different spatial configurations of fluid systems have been calculated. The results show that such systems redistribute heat in the crust and give rise to zones of concentrated heat energy storage and transfer. The pattern of the disturbances to the conductive heat flow depends on the arrangement of the fluid systems (which is a function of the crustal structure, temperature and regional stress field) and shows significant lateral and vertical variations. Even at very low velocities of the fluid percolation (a few millimetres per year) the disturbances to the conductive heat flow may reach 30-60%.},

abstract = {Data from faults with core recovery offshore Norway and from outcrops in study areas onshore demonstrate the development and continuity of smear along large (seismic-scale) faults. Smear along these faults is typically associated with thick (tens of metres) shale source layers and fault segments that are slightly offset, where the overlap between the segments creates an extensional dip relay. It is demonstrated that rock types other than shale, such as coal, siltstones and carbonates, may smear and thereby contribute to the low- permeable fault gouge. A critical threshold for the shale smear factor (SSF), given by the fault throw divided by the thickness of the shale source layer, is established to separate continuous and discontinuous smears. An SSF [&le;]4 is likely to correspond to a continuous smear along large faults and thereby to a sealing membrane on the fault surface. For small (subseismic) faults, a continuous smear can be maintained for both shale and coal source layers for much higher smear factors compared with large faults. The continuity of smear associated with small faults also displays a greater variation (SSF in the range of 1-50), to become less predictable than smear along large faults.},

In particular, hardly any information exists about claystones and mudstones which can make up 70-80% of a sedimentary basin. For the Upper Jurassic sediments of a section across the northern North Sea, basin modelling programs, using the geometric mean model, gave a deviation of 50degreesC for the present-day temperature, simply because the matrix conductivity was estimated by two different models. These uncertainties in the determination of thermal conductivities are partly due to problems in measuring, and partly to difficulties in modelling the thermal conductivity. Future work should concentrate on comparative studies and tests on all types of sedimentary rocks, directed towards improved measurement methods. This is of particular importance for clays, mudstones and shales, as measurements on these are associated with the greatest uncertainties. Standardized procedures that include detailed descriptions of sampling, sample preparation and measurement techniques are important to ensure that the thermal conductivity measured is unaffected by factors related to the measurement method. In thermal conductivity modelling it is our experience that the influence of sediment texture is underestimated by most models currently applied. Estimates based on the geometric mean model seem to be most reliable when the determination of matrix conductivity is restricted to the sediment type, mineralogy and texture of the sediments.},

Uplifted Variscan basement of the Black Forest and the Vosges forms the flanks of the southern part of the graben. Apatite and zircon fission-track (FT) analyses indicate a complex low-temperature thermal history of the basement that was deciphered by inverse modelling of FT parameters. The models were tested against the observed data and independent geological constraints. The zircon FT ages of 28 outcrop samples taken along an E–W trending transect across the Black Forest and the Vosges range from 136 to 312 Ma, the apatite FT ages from 20 to 83 Ma. The frequency distributions of confined track lengths are broad and often bimodal in shape indicating a complex thermal history. Cooling below 120°C in the Early Cretaceous to Palaeogene was followed by a discrete heating episode during the late Eocene and subsequent cooling to surface temperature. The modelled time–temperature (t–T) paths point to a total denudation of the flanks of URG in the range of 1.0–1.7 km for a paleogeothermal gradient of 60°C/km, and 1.3–2.2 km for a paleogeothermal gradient of 45°C/km since the late Eocene.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The identification and quantification of conductive and convective components in the heat transfer of a sedimentary basin is demonstrated for the Rheingraben. Three different methods of varying complexity as well as three independent data sets are employed: (1) energy budget considerations based on hydraulically perturbed thermal data from shallow boreholes (\textless 500 m), (2) 1-D vertical Peclet number analysis of thermal data from 22 deep boreholes (\textgreater 1000 m), and (3) 2-D finite difference modelling of the fully coupled fluid flow and heat transport equations on a vertical cross-section of the entire Rheingraben. Energy budget considerations yield a conductive basal heat flow density of 84 + 40/-10 mW m-2, and in good agreement with this Peclet number analysis, gives median values in the range 90 +- 35 mW m-2. In the first case, the basement is formed by low permeable, tertiary sediments at about 500 m depth, and in the second by the transition from the sedimentary graben fill to the crystalline basement at depths of between 2000 and 4000 m. It is shown how results from numerical modelling support the flow field assumptions made by methods (1) and (2), as well as the value of 80 +- 10 mW m-2 for average basal heat flow density entering the graben from below. Conversely, the Peclet number range Pe ≤ 1.2 inferred from method (2) can be applied for a (at least partial) calibration of the fully coupled hydrothermal model calculations. This technique is suggested as a potentially interesting thermal method for constraining regional-scale permeability. An interpretation of heat transport is presented that satisfies the experimentally established patterns of both temperature and heat flow density in the Rheingraben. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the thermal anomalies along the western rim of the graben (such as Pechelbronn, France or Landau, Germany) can be convincingly explained by a basin-wide, deep rooted E-W groundwater circulation that locally enhances a background basal heat flow density of about 80 mW m-1 on average by 50 per cent and at individual sites by as much as 120 per cent.},

abstract = {We present a numerical pure-shear stretching model to study the effect of the “depth of lithospheric necking” on the state of flexure at extensional basins. This model avoids the need for low flexural rigidities during synrift basin subsidence. The model also accounts for long-standing rift flank uplifts in the absence of significant thermal anomalies or underplating beneath rift shoulders, and it predicts low $\beta$ factors beneath basin centers. Numerical modeling of synthetic continental rift zones and rifted continental margins together with their gravity characteristics demonstrates that isostatic residual anomalies are sensitive indicators of the state of flexure at extensional basins, particularly at basin margins. Isostatic residual anomalies are particularly useful to study the state of lithospheric flexure because the results are not biased by assumptions on the loads that have to be made in a forward modeling approach. Previous studies of lithospheric flexure and gravity modeling might have underestimated flexural rigidities at extensional basins. Comparison of predicted gravity anomaly signatures with gravity data suggests that at narrow rift basins and young rifted continental margins, upward flexure occurs more commonly than does downward flexure. This can be explained by intermediate or deep levels of necking (>15 km). For rifted continental margins, the apparent transition in the state of flexure during basin evolution from upward to downward flexure points to intermediate levels of necking (15–20 km). The occurrence of intermediate to deep levels of necking at narrow rift basins and intermediate levels of necking at rifted margins is in accordance with brittle-ductile rheological models of the lithosphere. An intermediate depth range for the level of lithospheric necking at rifted continental margins is consistent with a scenario in which rifting preferentially occurs in an area where the lithosph{\`{e}}re is weakened by a thickened crust Rifting in areas of stronger lithosphere, as for example cratons, is probably more often associated with a deep level of necking, explaining the widespread occurrence of rift shoulders at failed rift basins. We have tested several depths of necking and a model of local isostasy for the Gulf of Lions margin in the northwestern Mediterranean. At positions of deep synrift grabens, models with depths of necking of 25–35 km predict crustal thicknesses that are more in accordance with observations than are models with a shallower level of necking. It appears that local isostasy cannot account for the present-day basin configuration and at the same time reproduce the observed strongly laterally varying bathymetry at the end of rifting, supporting a significant postrift flexural rigidity.},

abstract = {Fluid flow patterns due to free thermal convection in permeable rock masses have been investigated for the 3D geological architecture around the Mount Isa lead-zinc-silver and copper deposits. Key results for the range of parameters explored here are: (1) Flow pattern and temperature distribution in stratigraphic units with homogeneous permeability are similar to those in units with the same average permeability in a heterogeneous distribution. (2) The geometry of one highly permeable stratigraphic unit governs fluid flow to an extent where it spatially attracts a convection cell, irrespective of the volume of adjacent permeable units. (3) Even in a complex and heterogeneous system with patches of low permeability along the fluid pathways, the Rayleigh number can be used to determine whether free convection will occur or not. Numerical simulations in 3D of coupled fluid flow and heat transfer were carried out using the finite difference computer code SHEMAT. Two different levels of permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Firstly, heterogeneity introduced by stratigraphy and secondly, various heterogeneous permeability distributions within geological units. Further complexity was created by defining patches with very low permeability within those stratigraphic units. The results show that free convection in hydrothermal systems is highly sensitive to the 3D permeability distribution in the geological architecture.},

abstract = {Techniques for detection, evaluation, and prediction of pore pressures in low-permeability rocks and equations for fluid-pressure computations in most integrated basin-modeling software are based on relationships between porosity and effective stress in shales. However, recent data show that overpressured shales in the North Sea do not exhibit higher porosities than the normally pressured shales of the same formation at similar depths. To further evaluate the existence of porosity vs. effective stress relationships in shales, fluid-flow simulations and porosity modeling in a typical high-pressure and high-temperature well in the North Sea were undertaken. The parameters in the permeability and porosity equations were adjusted until a satisfactory fit was achieved between the observed and modeled porosity and fluid pressure at present. However, the modeled porosity and pore pressure vs. depth history of the sediments deviated significantly from known porosity and pore pressure vs. depth relationships that have been observed in North Sea shales and elsewhere today. Because the results from basin modeling based on porosity-stress relationships were unacceptable, irrespective of parameter choices, and the well data from the North Sea show no signs of elevated porosities in the overpressured shales, it is inferred that effective stress-driven compaction alone has not generated the hard overpressures observed in deeply buried North Sea shales. These conclusions are suggested to be generally applicable to shales with low porosities and hard overpressures worldwide, both because of the physics involved and because similar results can be extracted from published modeling in the Niger Delta.},

abstract = {Bottom-hole temperature (BHT) data measured in oil and gas wells constitute a large, low quality set of temperature observations commonly used in geothermal studies. Raw BHT data are, on the average, cooler than true formation temperatures. To estimate true formation temperatures, corrections must be applied. Empirical BHT corrections may be applied to BHT data for which only depths of measurement are known, but may not be valid outside of the area for which they are calibrated. If multiple BHT measurements from successive logging runs are available, the Horner plot correction procedure can be used. The accuracy of the Horner plot is limited by simplifying assumptions made in its derivation, and by the common lack of information on parameters such as duration of mud circulation. More detailed and complete treatments provide insight into the borehole equilibration process, but their application is similarly limited by a common lack of data regarding borehole thermal properties. A new type of empirical correction procedure may be derived in some areas and allows a correction to be made for BHTs for which only a depth and time of measurement are known. Noise is invariably present in the BHT data found on well log headers from oil and gas wells, and the consequence of noise in these data should be considered when choosing and applying a correction. Although the average nature and magnitude of error in raw BHT data may be approximately known, application of all BHT correction procedures to the typical data available from oil and gas well log headers usually involves an unknown amount of error. Reliable estimates of average geothermal conditions can be made only from suites of BHT data, and are condemned to be imprecise at best.},

Outcrop data show that fault displacement/thickness ratios and permeability vary widely. For simple single fault models, results for numerical models are compared with analytical and statistical methods. Representation of a fault as a transmissibility surface conflates the effects of four variables--fault zone thickness and permeability, grid-block size and matrix (host-rock) cell permeability. Random spatial variation of transmissibility factor values is well represented by a uniform transmissibility factor which is the arithmetic mean of the values representing log-normally distributed permeability and thicknesses. Realistic ranges of fault zone thicknesses can be represented without grid-block refinement by an upscaling method based on simple transformation of transmissibility factor curves derived from a range of coarse grid-block models. Sub-seismic faults have significant effects on effective permeability of model volumes at kilometre scales only when the faults are assigned a permeability less than c. 0.001 of the matrix permeability.},

abstract = {Abstract The sediments of the Upper Cretaceous to lower Palaeogene Chalk Group were deposited through a wide range of depositional processes. Chalk was originally formed by settlement of coccolithophorid skeletal remains from suspension in the water column, with bottom currents redistributing the sediment shortly after deposition. Locally, tilting of the sea-floor resulted in mass-movement of chalk at scales varying from decimetre-thick turbidites to slumps and slide sheets that were up to hundreds of metres thick. Syn-depositional tectonic activity, therefore, constituted an important control on chalk facies. To study this relation in more detail, a three-dimensional (3D)-seismic stratigraphical analysis was carried out, comparing two study areas that experienced contrasting syn-depositional tectonic evolutions. The Vlieland offshore area, which underwent gradual subsidence and westward tilting during deposition of the Chalk Group, is characterised by parallel and continuous reflections thought to represent pelagic chalk deposits. In the Dutch Central Graben, which was tectonically inverted during the Late Cretaceous to early Palaeogene, discontinuous and irregular seismic reflections that indicate large-scale reworking of sediment are found. The improved image quality of 3D- vs. 2D-seismic data allowed us to study the detailed geometry of allochthonous chalk bodies and aided the identification and tracing of the often subtle intra-Chalk Group unconformities, resulting in a subdivision of the Chalk Group into seven seismic sequences.},

We develop qualitative and quantitative schemes for evaluating fault-related permeability structures by using results of field investigations, laboratory permeability measurements, and numerical models of flow within and near fault zones. The qualitative scheme compares the percentage of the total fault zone width composed of fault core materials (e.g., anastomosing slip surfaces, clay-rich gouge, cataclasite, and fault breccias) to the percentage of subsidiary damage zone structures (e.g., kinematically related fracture sets, small faults, and veins). A more quantitative scheme is developed to define a set of indices that characterize fault zone architecture and spatial variability. The fault core and damage zone are distinct structural and hydrogeologic units that reflect the material properties and deformation conditions within a fault zone. Whether a fault zone will act as a conduit, barrier, or combined conduit-barrier system is controlled by the relative percentage of fault core and damage zone structures and the inherent variability in grain scale and fracture permeability. This paper outlines a framework for understanding, comparing, and correlating the fluid flow properties of fault zones in various geologic settings.},

@article{Ziegler2004,
abstract = {The extension of the lithosphere, controlling the development of rifted basins, is driven by a combination of plate-boundary forces, frictional forces exerted on the base of the lithosphere by the convecting asthenosphere and deviatoric tensional stresses developing over upwelling branches of the asthenospheric convection system. Although mantle plumes are not a primary driving force of rifting, they play an important secondary role by weakening the lithosphere and by controlling the level of rift-related volcanic activity. A distinction between "active" and "passive" rifting is only conditionally justified. The extension of the lithosphere, depending on its rate and magnitude, and the potential temperature of the asthenosphere, can cause by adiabatic decompression partial melting of the lower lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. In rift systems, the level and timing of volcanic activity is highly variable. The lack of volcanic activity implies "passive" rifting. An initial "passive" rifting stage can be followed by a more "active" one during which magmatism plays an increasingly important role. Magmatic destabilization of the Moho may account for the frequently observed discrepancy between upper and lower crustal extension factors. Combined with evidence for thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere, this suggest that the volume of the lithosphere is not necessarily preserved during rifting as advocated by conventional stretching models. The structural style of rifts is controlled by the rheological structure of the lithosphere, the availability of crustal discontinuities that can be tensionally reactivated, the mode (orthogonal or oblique) and amount of extension, and the lithological composition of pre- and syn-rift sediments. Simple-shear extension prevails in rifts that subparallel the structural grain of the basement. Pure-shear extension is typical for rifts cross-cutting the basement grain. Pre-existing crustal and mantle-lithospheric discontinuities contribute to the localization of rift systems. The duration of the rifting stage of extensional basins is highly variable. Stress field changes can cause abrupt termination of rifting. In major rift systems, progressive strain concentration on the zone of future crustal separation entails abandonment of lateral rifts. Depending on constraints on lateral block movements, crustal separation can be achieved after as little as 9 My and as much as 280 My of rifting activity. Syn-rift basin subsidence is controlled by isostatic adjustment of the crust to mechanical stretching of the lithosphere, its magmatic inflation and thermal attenuation of the mantle-lithosphere. Post-rift basin subsidence is governed by thermal reequilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Deep-seated thermal anomalies related to syn-rift pull-up of the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary have decayed after 60 My by about 65% and after 180 My by about 95%. The magnitude of post-rift subsidence is a function of the rift-induced thermal anomaly and crustal density changes, the potential temperature of the asthenosphere and initial water depths. Intraplate stresses can have an overprinting effect on post-rift subsidence. Stretching factors derived from post-rift subsidence analyses must be corrected for such effects.},

abstract = {Seismic refraction data obtained along fifteen lines in southern Germany in the 60's and in 1982-1984 were used to derive a 3-D model of crustal structure below the "South-German Triangle" bounded by the Bohemian Massif in the east, the Alps in the south and the Rhinegraben in the west. Both the older and the more recent data were interpreted with the same techniques taking into account the results of published crustal information. Along three lines the observations could be interpreted as a reversed system and here both traveltime and amplitude information was used applying two-dimensional (2-D) raytrace modelling resulting in 2-D models controlled by traveltimes and amplitudes. These three crustal cross sections supplement an existing 3-D model for southwest Germany. The characteristic features of the crustal structure of the South-German Triangle can be summarized as follows: An intermediate boundary, identified by many authors as Conrad discontinuity, is found in its central part at depths between 16 and 18 km. Towards the northwest and south it descends to 20 and 22 km, respectively. In the region of the Black Forest it occurs at a rather shallow level at depths of only 14 km. The depth to the Moho reaches values between 27 and 28 km in the central part of the South-German Triangle. Beneath the Black Forest and the southwestern part of the Swabian Jura, the crustal thickness is reduced ranging from 25 to 26 km. To the northwest the Moho dips only slightly, but to the northeast under the Bohemian Massif it reaches depths up to 35 km. Beneath the northern foreland of the Alps the Moho descends gradually to about 40 km depth near the northern margin of the Alps. A low-velocity zone in the middle crust changes its characteristics throughout the area of investigation and is even absent in some areas. The velocity decrease is generally less than 0.3 km/s, except under the central and northern Black Forest, where the velocity decreases by as much as 0.5 km/s. The existence of a laminated lower crust, i.e. a crust which comprises layers of alternating high and low velocity as was found beneath the Black Forest, is also indicated in some of the data obtained in 1982-1984 and shown in this contribution.},

abstract = {We study the influence of vertical fault block motion on the hydrodynamics of continental rift systems in this paper using finite element analysis. Numerical solutions to governing groundwater flow and heat transport equations within independently moving fault blocks are obtained using triangular elements. Hybrid, four-node "slip elements" developed for this study are employed along fault surfaces; standard three-node elements are used everywhere else. The model is used in a sensitivity study to assess the effects of permeability variations, subsidence/erosion rates, and water table configuration on basin hydrodynamics. Idealized simulations of rifting over a 1.5 m.y. period were constructed using two (horst and graben) fault blocks that are vertically offset by 4.5 km during the simulation period. Numerical results indicate that significant interaction between different fluid flow-impelling mechanisms (compaction-, topography-, and density-driven flow) occurs over a permeability range of 10 - 16.5 to 10 - 14.5 m2. Many of the flow fields, especially those in high-permeability (10 - 14.5 m2) horst and graben blocks, produce areas of high and low heat flow relative to conductive conditions. Models which incorporate alternating layers of permeable and less permeable layers indicate that the truncation/reconnection of aquifers can induce transient thermal and hydrologic behavior. The sensitivity results suggest a plausible mechanism for transient fluid flow on geologic timescales (105 to 107 years) within faulted basins and may help to explain the occurrence of some banded ore deposits or multiple episodes of sediment diagenesis preserved within the sedimentary rock record.},

This includes the results from seismic (reflection and refraction profiles, P- and S-wave tomography, mantle anisotropy), gravity, thermal, electromagnetic, elastic and petro-logical studies of the lithospheric mantle. We discuss major tectonic processes as reflected in the lithospheric structure of Europe, from Precambrian terrane accretion and subduction to Phanerozoic rifting, volcanism, subduction and continent-continent collision. The differences in the lithospheric structure of Precambrian and Phanerozoic Europe, as illustrated by a comparative analysis of different geophysical data, are shown to have both a compositional and a thermal origin. We propose an integrated model of physical properties of the European subcrustal lithosphere, with emphasis on the depth intervals around 150 and 250 km. At these depths, seismic velocity models, constrained by body- and surface-wave continent-scale tomography, are compared with mantle temperatures and mantle gravity anomalies. This comparison provides a framework for discussion of the physical or chemical origin of the major lithospheric anomalies and their relation to large-scale tectonic processes, which have formed the present lithosphere of Europe.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 1932013205 The variation of permeability with depth can be probed indirectly by various means, including hydrologic models that use geothermal data as constraints and the progress of metamorphic reactions driven by fluid flow. Geothermal and metamorphic data combine to indicate that mean permeability (k) of tectonically active continental crust decreases with depth (z) according to log�k�2248�22121420133.2�log�z, where k is in m2 and z in km. Other independently derived, crustal-scale k2013z relations are generally similar to this power-law curve. Yet there is also substantial evidence for local-to-regional-scale, transient, permeability-generation events that entail permeabilities much higher than these mean k2013z relations would suggest. Compilation of such data yields a fit to these elevated, transient values of log�k�2248�221211.520133.2�log�z, suggesting a functional form similar to that of tectonically active crust, but shifted to higher permeability at a given depth. In addition, it seems possible that, in the absence of active prograde metamorphism, permeability in the deeper crust will decay toward values below the mean k2013z curves. Several lines of evidence suggest geologically rapid (years to 103�years) decay of high-permeability transients toward background values. Crustal-scale k2013z curves may reflect a dynamic competition between permeability creation by processes such as fluid sourcing and rock failure, and permeability destruction by processes such as compaction, hydrothermal alteration, and retrograde metamorphism.},

These maps, prepared in the context of a TNO regional mapping project, are supported by nine regional structural cross sections and a table summarizing the timing of tectonic activity from Carboniferous to recent. These new regional maps enable the delineation of various structural elements but also reveal the development of these elements through time with improved detail. Since the latest Carboniferous the tectonic setting of the Netherlands changed repeatedly. During successive tectonic phases several pre-existing structural elements were reactivated and new elements appeared. The various identified regional structural elements are grouped into six tectonically active periods: Late Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. This study demonstrates that many structural elements and fault systems were repeatedly reactivated and that a clear distinction exists between long-lived elements, such as the Roer Valley Graben, and short-lived structural elements, such as the Terschelling Basin.},

The method of measuring permeability was different for the two data sets: samples from UK/Norway were measured by transient pulse decay (TPD), while the Danish samples were measured by routine core analysis. Petrological and petrophysical characterization of samples from the two data sets have revealed that all samples display a similar range of rock properties; the differences are not due to regional facies variations. It is likely that the low permeability values reported by TPD have more validity than routine core analyses in measuring lower porosity and permeability chalk (5-20% porosity, \textless0.01 mD). The fact that large sections of North Sea chalk potentially have much lower permeability than previously reported has widespread implications for petroleum migration and entrapment, and overpressure generation.},

Seismologically determined thicknesses derived from representative P-wave residuals agree in most regions both with the magnetotelluric inferences of depths of the top of a layer of increased electrical conductivity and with the geothermally based calculations that allow inferences of the lithospheric thickness from surface heat-flow data. The seismological definition of the lithosphere as a high-velocity layer overlying the low-velocity zone in the upper mantle seems to be close to the geothermal concept in which the lithospheric base is defined by temperatures near partial melting, decreasing the seismic velocities and increasing the electrical conductivity. Interpretations of seismic data used for constraining geothermal models of the deep lithosphere assume velocity variations to reflect mainly changes in the mineral composition. However, recent observations of large-scale seismic anisotropy show clearly that, in the subcrustal lithosphere, velocity variations due to anisotropy caused by preferred orientations of olivine crystals can be much larger than the velocity variations caused by temperature or compositional changes.},

We investigated a large data set of BHT and DST measurements taken in boreholes in the American Midcontinent, a geologically uniform stable cratonic area, and propose an empirical correction for BHTs based on relationships between BHTs, DSTs, and thermal logs. This empirical correction is compared with similar approaches determined for other areas. The data were analyzed by multivariate statistics prior to the BHT correction to identify anomalous measurements and quantify external influences. Spatial patterns in temperature measurements for major stratigraphic units outline relations to regional structure. Comparision of temperature and structure trend-surface residuals reveals a relationship between temperature highs and local structure highs. The anticlines, developed by continuous but intermittent movement of basement fault blocks in the Late Paleozoic, are subtle features having closures of 10–30rm and contain relatively small hydrocarbon reservoirs. The temperature anomalies of the order of 5–7u°C may reflect fluids moving upward along fractures and faults, rather than changes in thermal conductivity resulting from different pore fluids.},

Backstripping analysis of the available high resolution and high surface density of the database allows to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of tectonically driven subsidence to a much higher degree than previous studies. The sections and wells have also been forward modelled with a new `automated' modelling technique, with unlimited number of stretching phases, in order to quantify variations in timing and magnitude of rifting. It is demonstrated that the tectonic subsidence history in the Iberian Basin is characterized by pulsating periods of stretching intermitted by periods of relative tectonic quiescence and thermal subsidence. The number of stretching phases appears to be much larger than found by earlier studies, showing a close match with stretching phases found in other parts of the Iberian Peninsula and allowing a clear correlation with discrete phases in the opening of the Tethys and Atlantic.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical model for simulating deformation and induced fluid flow in fold-and-thrust belts. Unfractured rock strata are modeled as poroelastic media while fault zones are treated as plastic-elastic media. We introduce the slip element technique into a finite element code to accommodate large deformations along faults. Thrust displacements, stress field changes, and the effects of thrust faulting on groundwater flow are investigated by solving the coupled stress and flow equations numerically. The calculation shows that when a thrust sheet is displaced along its fault surface, the displacement-induced stress generates high pore pressure zones near the tectonic stress boundary and beneath low permeability ramps. These overpressures cause transient fluid flow across the thrust belt. Sensitivity studies on the hydrologic properties of the fault zone suggest that hydraulic conductivities within a fault play important roles in initiating slip deformation and in determining the extent of transient disturbances to the flow field. Low permeability can result in rapid pore pressure buildup in the fault, thereby reducing the effective strength of the fault which leads to earlier failures. A low-permeability fault can also impede the movement of flow into the footwall, thereby limiting the tectonic impact on the flow system within the hanging-wall. Application of the model to the McConnell Thrust in the Canadian Rockies indicates that the total volume of fluid flow induced by tectonic compression could have been of the order of 105 to 106 m3 over a time period of tens to hundreds of years accompanied by an average 100 m of thrust movement.},

abstract = {The Roer valley rift system (RVRS) is located in the northern prolongation of the upper Rhine Graben. During the Cenozoic, the evolution of the RVRS was influenced by two different rift systems situated in the North and in the South (the North Sea rift system and the West European rift system, respectively). During the last decades, moderate seismicity revealed the continuous activity of the graben border faults (the Peel Boundary fault zone -PBFZ- and the Feldbiss fault zone-FFZ-). We use a high precision digital elevation model (DEM) to characterize and quantify the present-day deformation along these faults. The fault pattern shows similarity to a strike-slip structure. However, analysis of the DEM reveals that the Recent to Quaternary formations and landforms affected by the fault activity are only vertically offset. This suggests a pure normal faulting mode for the main border faults and a direction of extension perpendicular to the graben (i.e., NE-SW). Quantification of the offset dated markers allows the determination of the displacement rates along the fault segments. In the southeastern part of the RVRS, the vertical displacement rates inferred for the FFZ and the southeastern PBFZ range between 55 and 65 mm/ky and around 65 mm/ky, respectively. In contrast, the displacement rates determined for the northwestern segment of the PBFZ are around 200 mm/ky. We explain these differences between the northwestern and southeastern parts of the RVRS by the large-scale geometry of the graben, the RVRS being symmetric in the south-east and asymmetric (half-graben) in the north-west. The deformation is accommodated by two border faults (FFZ and the south-eastern part of the PBFZ) in the south-east and by only one fault in the north-west (the north-western segment of the PBFZ). In addition, the thickness of the Neogene main depocentre in the northwestern half of the RVRS indicates a larger amount of extension in this part of the graben than in the south-east. The combination of the graben geometry and the amount of extension can explain the differences in the displacement rate.},

For default compositional and thermal parameters, the modeling results show strengthening in all basins, and in particular during inversion, with strength increases up to about 2 TN m−1 (20%) relative to their initial values. Given predominantly relatively constant intraplate stresses in continental lithosphere, this is in disagreement with repeated localization of basin deformation. In a thorough sensitivity analysis we explore the possibilities that permissible variations in tectonic history, compositional, rheological and thermal parameters can, in a particular combination, result in slight weakening of the basin, in agreement with reactivation during inversion. However, such a combination reflects an extreme scenario, which is not founded by geological evidence and, statistically, is very unlikely to apply for all basins. A far more likely explanation for relative and permanent weakening of the basins is the presence of pre-existing weak zones, deviating from standard rheological assumptions. At (upper) crustal levels, weakening can be attributed to pre-existing marked faults by a reduced friction angle. This weakening has a pronounced influence on lithospheric strength provided that the reduction in friction angle of pre-existing faults can be extrapolated to the upper mantle. Alternatively, weakening of the upper mantle can be attributed to (1) ductile localization mechanisms, as reflected by the occurrence of upper mantle shear zones, or (2) the occurrence of rheologically weak material, as indicated by upper mantle reflectors.},

abstract = {Numerical models that solve governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport are commonly applied to analyze quantitatively the effects of heterogeneity. These models require maps of spatially variable hydraulic properties. Because complete three-dimensional information about hydraulic properties is never obtainable, numerous methods have been developed to interpolate between data values and use geologic, hydrogeologic, and geophysical information to create images of aquifer properties. Image creation approaches fall into three general categories: structure-imitating, process-imitating, and descriptive. Structure-imitating methods rely on one or more of the following to constrain the geometry of spatial patterns in geologic media: correlated random fields, probabilistic rules, and deterministic constraints developed from facies relations. Structure-imitating methods include spatial statistical algorithms and geologically based sedimentation pattern-matching approaches. Process-imitating models include aquifer model calibration methods and geologic process models. Aquifer model calibration methods use governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport to relate hydraulic properties to heads and solute information through history and steady state data matching. Geologic process models combine fundamental laws of conservation of mass and momentum with sediment transport equations to simulate spatial patterns in grain size distributions. At the sedimentary basin scale, multiprocess models include thermomechanical mechanisms of basin subsidence. Descriptive methods couple geologic observations with facies relations to divide an aquifer into zones of characteristic hydraulic properties. All approaches are capable of reproducing heterogeneity over a range of scales and considering some types of geologic information. Some approaches are strictly spatial while some are linked to the time evolution of sedimentation. Some approaches can be conditioned on measurements. Recent advances aimed at infusing geologic information into images of the subsurface include extracting more information from sedimentological facies models, incorporating qualitative geologic information into random field generators and simulating depositional processes. Classes of research missing from the literature include multiprocess models that incorporate diagenesis and three-dimensional surface water flow, hybrid methods that combine features of existing approaches, and approaches that can make use of all available geologic, geophysical, and hydrologic data.},

The bulk closure temperature in some samples may tend slightly higher due to the presence of diffusion domains larger (and therefore more retentive) than the sites in which the majority of He resides. The diffusivity of He in calcite is independent of the genesis of the mineral (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic) or the source of the He (radiogenic, common, or laboratory induced) and in all samples analyzed the effective diffusion dimension for He is smaller than the size of the crystals investigated. Although calcite is a low-U mineral, this shortcoming can be overcome by analyzing large samples (>2�mm diameter) provided samples have a minimum of $\sim$0.3�ppm�U; samples with smaller concentrations of alpha-producers are unlikely to produce enough radiogenic 4He sufficient to overwhelm He present in the crystals at the time they passed through their closure temperature.},

As a consequence, it is often difficult to determine the relative impact of the two phenomena on the temperature-depth data at a site. A number of models for ground-water flow, ground surface temperature change, and a combination of the two processes, are fitted to two example temperature logs showing characteristic nonlinearity. Examples of the possible impact of one phenomenon on the parameters calculated for the other phenomenon demonstrate the potential interactive influence. The analysis can be used to estimate potential uncertainties in calculations of ground-water flow and ground surface temperature change from subsurface temperature data, and therefore how interpretations of ground-water flow and ground surface warming might be affected.

abstract = {The Campine Basin offers a variety of potential CO2 storage sites. Within the Roer Valley Graben area Triassic Buntsandstein rocks have an estimated CO2 storage capacity of several hundred million tons. Mesozoic shales and younger sediments provide adequate sealing. Westphalian D sandstones may possess storage opportunities in the southern graben area, and the karstified/dolomitized parts of the Dinantian carbonates in the western sub-basin have an estimated CO2 storage capacity of 130 x 106 tons. In places, the Dinantian reservoirs may be combined with carbonate reservoirs in the underlying Devonian strata. Sealing is provided by Namurian shales and Westphalian coals and shales. Along the western and southern edge of the basin the Dinantian reservoir is sealed by Cretaceous chalks and marls. Besides aquifers, the available coal qualifies for CO2 storage. Six Six methane target areas contain a producible enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM), volume of 53-79 x 109m3. This provides a minimum CO2 sequestration potential of 400 x 106 tons. ECBM development factors include the sedimentological setting of the coal sequence as well as changes in porosity, permeability and stress conditions induced by former mining activities. The CO2 storage capacity in abandoned coalmines is limited. Nevertheless, CO2 storage in the abandoned mines may be an option when it is combined with coalmine methane extraction or ECBM production in neighbouring areas.},

abstract = {The strength and permeability of fault zones must be quantified in order to accurately predict crustal strength and subsurface fluid migration. To this end, we performed experiments on mixtures of fine-grained quartz and kaolinite incremented at 10 wt% intervals between the two end-member components (analogues for natural fault gouge) in order to establish their strength and fluid flow properties during hydrostatic and shear loading. Hydrostatically compacted samples exhibited permeability reduction on increasing effective pressures from 5 MPa to 50 MPa, with the rate of reduction displaying strong dependency on the synthetic fault gouge composition. The permeability decreases continuously with increasing kaolinite content. Porosity exhibits a distinct minimum that evolves with increasing effective pressure according to the relative compaction of the quartz and kaolinite end-members. Porosity evolution with increasing clay content is predicted satisfactorily by a simple ideal packing model. At the highest effective pressure (50 MPa), permeability reduced log-linearly over 4 orders of magnitude with increasing clay content. Mechanically, sheared gouge samples showed a continuous reduction in frictional strength with increasing clay fraction. Permeability decreased further on shear loading after initial hydrostatic compaction to 50 MPa. This was most evident for the pure quartz end-member, with two orders of magnitude additional reduction, whereas the clay-rich samples were reduced only tenfold, mostly before a shear strain of 5. Variation of permeability with both clay content and shear deformation may be adequately described by previously published empirical predictors for fault zone permeability. Clay content has the largest effect on permeability, and shear deformation affects permeability of quartz-rich gouges more than clay-rich gouges.},

abstract = {The Eridanos fluvio-deltaic system, draining most of north-western Europe, developed during the Late Cenozoic as a result of simultaneous uplift of the Fennoscandian shield and accelerated subsidence in the North Sea Basin. This seismo-stratigraphic study aims to reconstruct the large-scale depositional architecture of the deltaic portion of the basin fill and relate it to external controls. A total of 27 units have been recognized. They comprise over 62�103�km3 in the Southern North Sea Basin alone, and have an average delta surface area of 28�103�km2, which suggests that the size of the drainage area was about 1.1�106�km2. Water depth in the depocentre is seen to decrease systematically over time. This trend is interrupted by a deepening phase between 6.5 and 4.5�Ma that can be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of increased uplift of the Fennoscandian shield, increased subsidence of the Southern North Sea Basin, and a long-term eustatic highstand. All these observations point to a tectonic control on long-term average rates of accommodation and supply. Controls on short-term variations are inferred from variations in rates of sediment supply and bifurcation of the delta channel network. Both rates were initially low under warm, moist, relatively stable climate conditions. The straight wave-dominated delta front gradually developed into a lobate fluvial-dominated delta front. Two high-amplitude sea-level falls affected the Pliocene units, which are characterized by widespread delta-front failures. Changes in relative sea level and climate became more frequent from the late Pliocene onward, as the system experienced the effects of glacial2013interglacial transitions. Peaks in sedimentation and bifurcation rates were coeval with cold (glacial) conditions. The positive correlation between rates of supply and bifurcation on the one hand, and climate proxies (pollen and 03B418O records) on the other hand is highly significant. The evidence presented in this study convincingly demonstrates the control of climate on time-averaged sediment supply and channel-network characteristics, despite the expected nonuniformity and time lags in system response. The presence of a clearly discernible climate signal in time-averaged sediment supply illustrates the usefulness of integrated seismo-stratigraphic studies for basin-wide analysis of delta evolution on geological time scales.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional, porous-medium, steady-state, coupled fluid- and heat-transport models are used to investigate some of the hydrogeological and thermal consequences of steeply dipping fault damage zones in a normally pressured basin setting. Simple geometries and conservative petrophysical properties can produce large-scale buoyancy-driven circulation, both outside and within the fault zone. An average (homogeneous) basin permeability of only 7 mD kh (horizontal permeability) and 0.07 mD kv (vertical permeability) results in a free convection cell of this type, with the upflow being localized by a 300 m wide fault zone (50 mD kh, 0.5 mD kv). Steady-state temperature anomalies as large as 15degreesC at the top of the fault zone can be produced by this arrangement. Smaller values of basin permeability still result in a similar circulation pattern, but at flow rates which produce temperature anomalies that are below detection levels. When the basin fill is more heterogeneous (layered), higher permeabilities can exist in some layers without large-scale convection occurring, because of the dampening effect of other, lower permeability units. In realistic geometrical configurations that are similar to the North Sea Central Graben, the fluid flow system is dominated by within-fault-zone convective circulation that produces local (\textless10 km half-wavelength), high amplitude (50degreesC) temperature anomalies which are comparable to the largest of those actually observed in the subsurface.},

abstract = {Vitrinite reflectance measurements on Pennsylvanian coals in the Illinois basin indicate significantly higher thermal maturity than can be explained by present-day burial depths. An interval of additional sedimentary section, now removed by erosion, has been suggested to account for the discrepancy. Although burial could indeed account for the observed maturity levels of organic matter, fluid-inclusion temperatures provide a stringent additional constraint. In this article, we combine measurements of coal maturity with fluid-inclusion temperatures from three sites to constrain the basin's thermal and burial history: the Fluorspar district at the Illinois basin's southern margin, the Upper Mississippi Valley zinc district at the basin's northern margin, and a north-central location. Two-dimensional numerical modeling of a north-south cross section through the basin tests scenarios both with and without regional fluid flow. Vitrinite reflectance values can be matched assuming burial by 1.8-2.8 km of southward-thickening additional, post-Pennsylvanian sedimentary section. In the central and northern Illinois basin, however, these burial depths and temperatures are not sufficient to account for the fluid-inclusion data. To account for both parameters with burial alone does not appear feasible. In contrast, our best hypothesis assumes a wedge of post-Pennsylvanian sediment-thickening southward to about 1.2 km and a brief period of magmatism in the Fluorspar district. Significant advective heat redistribution by northward regional fluid flow accounts for fluid-inclusion temperatures and coal maturities throughout the basin. The modeling results demonstrate the potential contribution of advective heat transport to the thermal history of the Illinois basin.},

abstract = {Drilling through the Palaeoproterozoic bedrock at Forsmark, central Sweden, during the site investigation for a potential geological repository of highly radioactive nuclear waste has provided high quality drill-core material from the upper 1�km of the Fennoscandian Shield. Analyses of stable isotopes ([delta]13C, [delta]18O, [delta]34S, 87Sr/86Sr), rare earth elements and fluid inclusions in fracture filling calcite and pyrite from these drill cores have resulted in the discrimination of several episodes of fracture mineralisations. These events represent migration of fluids during a wide range of conditions, ranging from high-temperature hydrothermal to present-day groundwater circulation. Four major events have been distinguished: 1) Precipitation of epidote, chlorite and quartz under hydrothermal conditions (T�>�150-200��C) during the Proterozoic, sometime between 1.8 and 1.1�Ga. 2) Hydrothermal circulation at temperatures close to 200��C with precipitation of adularia, albite, prehnite, laumontite, calcite and chlorite. Most of these minerals precipitated during a tectonothermal event between 1.1 and 1.0�Ga, possibly in response to far-field effects of the Sveconorwegian orogeny. 3) Precipitation of mainly quartz, calcite, pyrite and asphaltite occurred during the Palaeozoic, at temperatures between 60 and 190��C (mainly at <�100��C). Mixing of a fluid emanating from an organic rich overlying sedimentary cover and a deep basinal fluid from the crystalline bedrock is suggested to have caused this precipitation, possibly as a far-field response to the Caledonian orogeny and/or the development of the Caledonian foreland basin. 4) The youngest generation of fracture minerals is associated with formation of clay minerals and calcite with minor occurrences of pyrite and goethite. These minerals have probably precipitated episodically during a long time period (possibly from the Late Palaeozoic to the present) from various fluids at low temperature conditions (<�50��C). Few calcites in equilibrium with the present groundwater suggest that the ongoing precipitation of calcite is very limited.},

abstract = {Motivated by the need to document and evaluate the types and variability of fault zone properties that potentially affect aquifer systems in basins of the middle Rio Grande rift, we systematically characterized structural and cementation properties of exposed fault zones at 176 sites in the northern Albuquerque Basin. A statistical analysis of measurements and observations evaluated four aspects of the fault zones: (1) attitude and displacement, (2) cement, (3) lithology of the host rock or sediment, and (4) character and width of distinctive structural architectural components at the outcrop scale. Three structural architectural components of the fault zones were observed: (1) outer damage zones related to fault growth; these zones typically contain deformation bands, shear fractures, and open extensional fractures, which strike subparallel to the fault and may promote ground-water flow along the fault zone; (2) inner mixed zones composed of variably entrained, disrupted, and dismembered blocks of host sediment; and (3) central fault cores that accommodate most shear strain and in which persistent low- permeability clay-rich rocks likely impede the flow of water across the fault. The lithology of the host rock or sediment influences the structure of the fault zone and the width of its components. Different grain-size distributions and degrees of induration of the host materials produce differences in material strength that lead to variations in width, degree, and style of fracturing and other fault-related deformation. In addition, lithology of the host sediment appears to strongly control the distribution of cement in fault zones. Most faults strike north to north-northeast and dip 55? - 77? east or west, toward the basin center. Most faults exhibit normal slip, and many of these faults have been reactivated by normal-oblique and strike slip. Although measured fault displacements have a broad range, from 0.9 to 4,000 m, most are <100 m, and fault zones appear to have formed mainly at depths less than 1,000 m. Fault zone widths do not exceed 40 m (median width = 15.5 m). The mean width of fault cores (0.1 m) is nearly one order of magnitude less than that of mixed zones (0.75 m) and two orders of magnitude less than that of damage zones (9.7 m). Cements, a proxy for localized flow of ancient ground water, are common along fault zones in the basin. Silica cements are limited to faults that are near and strike north to northwest toward the Jemez volcanic field north of the basin, whereas carbonate fault cements are widely distributed. Coarse sediments (gravel and sand) host the greatest concentrations of cement within fault zones. Cements fill some extension fractures and, to a lesser degree, are concentrated along shear fractures and deformation bands within inner damage zones. Cements are commonly concentrated in mixed zones and inner damage zones on one side of a fault and thus are asymmetrically distributed within a fault zone, but cement does not consistently lie on the basinward side of faults. From observed spatial patterns of asymmetrically distributed fault zone cements, we infer that ancient ground-water flow was commonly localized along, and bounded by, faults in the basin. It is apparent from our study that the Albuquerque Basin contains a high concentration of faults. The geometry of, internal structure of, and cement and clay distribution in fault zones have created and will continue to create considerable heterogeneity of permeability within the basin aquifers. The characteristics and statistical range of fault zone features appear to be predictable and consistent throughout the basin; this predictability can be used in ground-water flow simulations that consider the influence of faults.},

abstract = {The first detailed reconstruction of the continental paleoclimate evolution of the Northwest German Tertiary (Late Oligocene to Pliocene) is presented. The paleoclimate data are derived from the paleobotanical record using the coexistence approach, a method recently introduced that employs climatic requirements of the Nearest Living Relatives of a fossil flora. Twenty six megafloras (fruits and seeds, leaves, woods) from the Tertiary succession of the Lower Rhine Basin and neighboring areas are analyzed with respect to ten meteorological parameters. Additionally, two sample sets from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene sediments comprising 396 palynofloras are analyzed by the same method providing a higher temporal resolution. The temperature curves show a comparatively cooler phase in the Late Oligocene, a warm interval the Middle Miocene, and a cooling starting at 14 Ma. The cooling trend persisted until Late Pliocene with a few higher frequency temperature variations observed. From the beginning of Late Miocene to the present, the seasonality increases and climate appears to have been less stable. As indicated by the precipitation data, a Cfa climate with wet summers persisted in NW Germany from Late Oligocene to Late Pliocene. The results obtained are well in accordance with regional and global isotope curves derived from the marine record, and allow for a refined correlation of the Tertiary succession in the Lower Rhine Basin with the international standard. It is shown that the reconstructed data are largely consistent with the continental climate record for the Northern Hemisphere, as reported by various authors. Discrepancies with previous reconstructions are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {The permeability k of a porous medium is a geometrical pore space attribute required for quantifying fluid flows and transport processes for hydrological, civil, agriculture, and petroleum engineering applications. Permeability is often expressed as proportional to a characteristic length squared and inversely proportional to factors accounting for porosity, pore shape, and tortuosity effects. Compaction and diagenesis reduce porosity, mean pore size, and connectivity, resulting in decrease in k. Permeability prediction relies on suitable selection of a characteristic length that may vary from simple hydraulic radius approximation of Kozeny-Carman to more complex critical path analysis to identify flow-limiting pore size. For porous media undergoing significant changes in pore space (e.g., compaction due to anthropogenic activities), the proper choice of a robust characteristic length is particularly challenging. We propose using the air entry pressure, a natural characteristic length that gauges the largest drainable pore size. This choice of a characteristic length is compatible with the Aissen formula that provides robust estimates of k for complex pore shapes. Additionally, the model considers geometrical (tortuosity) factors and links relative changes in porosity to concurrent changes in k. The model was tested against experimental data for sands, sandstones with different cementing agents, and unconsolidated soils. For unconsolidated sands and soils the model provides reasonable predictions of permeability for the entire range of porosities determined in laboratory or field experiments. However, for sandstones, and especially those containing cementing agents such as clay, the model is valid up to a critical porosity where hydraulic connectivity is lost, resulting in drastic reduction in k. The geometrical factor for soils was influenced by silt-to-clay ratio, while for sands, it was correlated with mean grain diameter. The model offers improvement in predicting k and provides a means for incorporating critical pore size and connectivity information in addition to porosity.},

Although fluid flow as a result of topographic elevation can be easily simulated, porewater movement as a result of consolidation of sediment requires a physically more complex approach, as it involves sediment deformation, moving boundaries and changing sediment properties. This paper describes a mathematical model based on Terzaghi's theory of the consolidation process that calculates fluid flow as a result of consolidation, and additionally incorporates fluid flow from topographic elevation. Porosity changes are calculated as a function of fluid pressure changes, using the equation of state for porosity, thereby avoiding empirical porosity/depth formulations such as Athy's equation. It is assumed that hydraulic conductivity and sediment compressibility are reduced during consolidation, and hydraulic diffusivity remains approximately constant during the consolidation process. The permeability/porosity relation is described by the Kozeny-Carman function. The capabilities of the program are illustrated by two simple experiments.},

Tectonic overlays summarize Caledonian and Variscan tectonic units, Permo-Carboniferous fault systems and magmatic provinces, Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift-wrench systems, areas of intraplate compression, the outlines of Alpine orogens and the distribution of oceanic crust. Based on a comparison of these overlays with the Moho depth map we assess processes that controlled the evolution of the crust in the various parts of Europe through time. The present-day crustal configuration of Western and Central Europe results from polyphase Late Palaeozoic to recent lithospheric deformation that overprinted the margin of the Proterozoic East European Craton and particularly the Caledonian and Variscan crustal domains. Following consolidation of the Caledonides, their crustal roots were destroyed in conjunction with Devonian wrench tectonics and back-arc rifting. During the Permo-Carboniferous tectonomagmatic cycle, wrench faulting disrupted the crust of the Variscan Orogen and its foreland and the lithosphere of these regions was thermally destabilized. Late Permian and Mesozoic re-equilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system was interrupted by the development of the Arctic-North Atlantic, Tethyan and associated rift systems. During the Alpine orogenic cycle, intraplate compressional stresses controlled basin inversion-related crustal thickening and lithospheric folding, as well as the evolution of the Rhine-Rhone rift system. Variably deep crustal roots characterize the Alpine orogenic chains. Neogene back-arc extension disrupted the eastern Pyrenees, Betic-Balearic, Apennine and Dinarides orogens.},

abstract = {Quantitative subsidence analysis for a number of rifted basins in the northern Atlantic/Mediterranean region provides evidence for rapid phases of PlioQuaternary subsidence. The observed acceleration in tectonic subsidence occurs after a phase of general quiescence in subsidence in these basins and deviates from predictions of stretching models. The latter indicate a decay of subsidence with time after Mesozoic-Tertiary basin formatioh and a slow tectonic subsidence in Plio-Quaternary times. A possible explanation for the observed patterns of anomalous subsidence could be an increase in the level of intraplate compression in the northern Atlantic region. Intraplate stress changes in the Plio-Quaternary are related to the dynamics of African/ Eurasian collision processes and a reorganization of spreading directions in the AtlAntic, possibly reflecting a plate reorganization of global nature. It seems that the Plio-Quaternary record reflects a period of increased levels of neotectonic activity, interplaying with periods of (de)glaciation. Stress-induced topography in the onshore parts of continental margins, coupled with the stress-induced subsidence in the offshore deeper parts of the basins, could have contributed to recent phases of uplift in Fennoscandia, augmenting the uplift induced by glacial unloading. Estimates of ice thicknesses are directly inferred from the observed uplift ignoring other driving mechanisms whereas topography plays a crucial role in the dynamics of glaciation. It is, therefore, important to quantdy the interplay of rapid tectonic uplift and subsidence phases with climatic effects during the Plio-Quaternary.},

Las reservas econ{\'{o}}micas, tales como petr{\'{o}}leo o dep{\'{o}}sitos minerales, se interpretan como el resultado del flujo de fluidos a escala de cuenca durante largos periodos de tiempo. Los sistemas de flujo f{\'{o}}siles pueden estudiarse mediante el an{\'{a}}lisis de las alteraciones diagen{\'{e}}ticas, de las inclusiones fluidas y de los cementos. Este an{\'{a}}lisis permite conocer las condiciones f{\'{i}}sicas y qu{\'{i}}micas de los fluidos y de las rocas durante su evoluci{\'{o}}n paleohidrogeol{\'{o}}gica. Los modelos de simulaci{\'{o}}n a escala de cuenca son utilizados para complementar el registro preservado en las rocas y para desarrollar modelos conceptuales de la evoluci{\'{o}}n hidr{\'{a}}ulica de la cuenca y de la generaci{\'{o}}n de las reservas econ{\'{o}}micas. Durante la evoluci{\'{o}}n de una cuenca, el r{\'{e}}gimen de flujo puede evolucionar de un tipo a otro. El r{\'{e}}gimen m{\'{a}}s importante, en lo que se refiere a velocidad y capacidad de transportar solutos y energ{\'{i}}a t{\'{e}}rmica, es el flujo gravitacional originado por la topograf{\'{i}}a, cuyo principal requisito es que existan zonas de la cuenca, o alrededor de ella, con elevaciones por encima del nivel del mar. Cuando no existe esta condici{\'{o}}n, el principal r{\'{e}}gimen de migraci{\'{o}}n de fluidos es el flujo por consolidaci{\'{o}}n. Las velocidades de flujo originadas por este mecanismo son varios {\'{o}}rdenes de magnitud inferiores al flujo originado por la topograf{\'{i}}a, pero a pesar de ello es capaz de crear sobrepresiones importantes. La p{\'{e}}rdida epis{\'{o}}dica y repentina de agua en estos compartimentos sometido a sobrepresi{\'{o}}n suele realizarse a velocidad elevada, lo que origina desequilibrios t{\'{e}}rmicos y qu{\'{i}}micos, temporales y locales, entre el fluido y la roca.

Six profile-lines with total length of 13982 m provided information on the 40-600 m depth range, covering Lower Pleistocene to Miocene strata with special emphasis on the Plio-Pleistocene Kieseloolite formation. Data quality depends on near-surface conditions and on degree of deformation in some fault zones, with better results for seismic detonator sources compared to vibroseis sources. The new data confirm the segmented character of the fault system with occurrence of fault bends, relay ramps and branching of overlapping fault sequences, testifying of the strong tectonic activity during the lower Pleistocene. Antiform structures along the Bichterweerd scarp, relaying the Feldbiss to the Geleen fault in the Meuse valley, are presented as a model for the Tertiary evolution of the Bree Uplift.},

abstract = {Studies of inverted basins based solely on the preserved section provide only partial insight into the thermal and tectonic history of basin development. Equally important is that part of the history represented by section removed by erosion during inversion. Thermal History Reconstruction, involving application of Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTATM) and Vitrinite Reflectance (VR) to define the timing and magnitude of key erosional and/or thermal episodes, and integration of this information with data from the preserved section, provides a more complete description. Case histories from the UK, New Zealand and Australia are presented to demonstrate this approach. Much of northern and eastern England, the Irish Sea and the Southern North Sea was affected by heating apparently due largely to additional burial, followed by early Tertiary cooling due to regional uplift and erosion, synchronous with recognized basin inversion events. Heating associated with this episode caused generation of hydrocarbons throughout the region. Areas conventionally regarded as not inverted appear to have been subjected to km-scale uplift and erosion, which was not restricted to classic  inversion axes'. Failure to allow for these effects can lead to a significant underestimation of regional maturity trends. Thermal History Reconstruction is also essential in areas that have undergone more than one episode of inversion. For example in Inner Moray Firth well 12/16--1 maximum palaeotemperatures in the Carboniferous section were reached prior to Hercynian inversion and the chances of preserving any hydrocarbons generated from Carboniferous or older source rocks appear poor. In southeastern Australia, early Cretaceous rift basins underwent mid-Cretaceous inversion at a time of high palaeogeothermal gradients (c. 60{degrees}C km-1), and basement margins were also inverted at that time. Again, early generation implies that the chances of preservation of hydrocarbons are small. By integrating stratigraphic and structural relationships within the preserved section with data on the palaeo-thermal history of a section derived from direct measurements of palaeotemperature profiles, the complete history of hydrocarbon generation may be reconstructed with confidence.},

abstract = {In this model for the evolution of large crustal faults, water that originally came from the country rock saturates the initially highly porous and permeable fault zone. During shearing, the fault zone compacts and water flows back into the country rock, but the flow is arrested by silicate deposition that forms very low permeability seals between the fault zone and the country rock. Because of variations in temperature and mineralogical composition and the complex structure of the fault zone, a three-dimensional network of seals is formed in the fault zone itself; thus, the high-pressure fluid is not evenly distributed. As in deep oil reservoirs, the fluid will be confined to seal-bounded fluid compartments of various sizes and porosity that are not hydraulically connected with each other or with the hydrostatic regime in the country rock. When the seal between two of these compartments is ruptured, an electrical streaming potential will be generated by the sudden movement of fluid from the high-pressure compartment to the low-pressure compartment. When the pore pressure in the two compartments reaches its final equilibrium state, the average effective normal stress across them may be lower than it was initially, and, if the two compartments are large enough, this condition may trigger an earthquake. During an earthquake, many of the remaining seals will be ruptured, and the width of the fault zone will increase by failure of the geometric irregularities on the fault. This newly created, highly porous and permeable, but now wider fault zone will fill with water, and the process described above will be repeated. Thus, the process is an episodic one, with the water moving in and out of the fault zone, and each large earthquake should be preceded by an electrical and/or magnetic signal.},

abstract = {We have developed a diode laser (25 W, 808 nm) system for He extraction from minerals for (U-Th)/He chronometry. The laser beam is delivered via a 600 $\mu$m fiber cable and focused using a binocular microscope. Temperatures necessary for He release from apatite (500–600�C) and zircon (1100–1300�C) encapsulated in Pt-foil tubes are attained by heating to 0.5 W for 30 s and 1.25–2.5 W for 20 min, respectively, using a defocused beam. Heating at these powers does not result in measurable U and/or Th loss from apatite, as noted by the preservation of the distinct Th/U in multiple splits of two different Durango apatite crystals. Analyses of Durango and the California Institute of Technology internal standard apatite 97MR22 yield (U-Th)/He ages of 32.8 � 1.8 Ma (1$\sigma$, n = 11) and 4.6 � 0.5 (1$\sigma$, n = 5), respectively, well within accepted ages. The (U-Th)/He age and Th/U of five Fish Canyon Tuff zircon aliquots yield 29.3 � 2.2 Ma (1$\sigma$) and 0.6 � 0.03, respectively, and are indistinguishable from ages produced by resistance furnace He extraction. Heating of unencapsulated minerals shows that the diode laser couples well with optically opaque minerals (e.g., hornblende, biotite, muscovite, garnet) and basalt groundmass, suggesting that diode lasers offer a cheap, small, low-maintenance alternative to Nd:YAG and Ar ion lasers for 40Ar/39Ar, cosmogenic noble gas, and stable isotope studies.},

The palaeoclimate proxy record indicates subtropical temperatures and humid conditions for the Late Callovian and Early Oxfordian interval. Thereafter, the results show stepwise warming and aridization. The onset of this trend can be related to global palaeogeographical changes associated with the breakup of Pangea. The aridity and temperature reached their maximum development during the Late Kimmeridgian and Portlandian. In the earliest Cretaceous, the climate returned to slightly cooler, tropical and humid conditions. When combined with regional palaeogeographical reconstructions, these conditions suggest that the recorded Late Kimmeridgian to Portlandian arid phase may be linked to the arrival of cooler high latitude waters to the North Sea region due to the opening of the North Atlantic seaway connecting the warm Tethys Ocean in the south to the Boreal Ocean.},

The model uses distributions of activation energies for each of four reactions: elimination of water, carbon dioxide, methane and higher hydrocarbons. The resulting composition is used to calculate vitrinite reflectance via correlations between elemental composition and reflectance. The correlations are derived from published measurements. The model is valid for %Ro values from slightly less than 0.3 to slightly greater than 4. Model calculations are compared to published vitrinite data from both laboratory experiments and sedimentary columns where adequate thermal histories are available. Calculated and measured %Ro values generally agree within 0.1 at low rank and 0.4 at high rank, which is comparable to uncertainties in the experimental values. This confirms our starting premise that vitrinite reflectance is properly described by standard chemical kinetics with activation energies that extrapolate from laboratory to geological maturation temperatures. The model indicates that the relationship between the extent of oil generation and vitrinite reflectance is nearly independent of heating rate.},

We consider specifically those conditions where the hydraulic gradient on the water table drives the flow system, thermally induced buoyancy forces modify but do not control the flow field. The hydrologic disturbance of the thermal field and the significance of a water table gradient transverse to the regional slope depend upon the interplay of the three-dimensional water table configuration, the basin geometry including the depth to the basal impermeable boundary, the anisotropy, and the permeability of the subsurface formations. These factors act together to determine groundwater flow patterns, depths of circulation along individual flow lines, and areal distribution of groundwater recharge and discharge. The uniformity of surface heat flow values determined from a series of shallow boreholes in an advectively disturbed regime will depend on the location of the measurement sites relative to the hinge line separating areas of groundwater recharge and discharge and on the extent of the region centered about the hinge line where fluid inflow/outflow rates are insufficient to perturb the thermal field.},

abstract = {Dome growth and explosive degassing are fundamental processes in the cycle of continental arc volcanism(1,2). Because both processes generate seismic energy, geophysical field studies of volcanic processes are often grounded in the interpretation of volcanic earthquakes(3). Although previous seismic studies have provided important constraints on volcano dynamics(4-6), such inversion results do not uniquely constrain magma source dimension and material properties. Here we report combined optical geodetic and seismic observations that robustly constrain the sources of long-period volcanic earthquakes coincident with frequent explosive eruptions at the volcano Santiaguito, in Guatemala. The acceleration of dome deformation, extracted from high- resolution optical image processing, is shown to be associated with recorded long-period seismic sources and the frequency content of seismic signals measured across a broadband network. These earthquake sources are observed as abrupt subvertical surface displacements of the dome, in which 20 - 50- cm uplift originates at the central vent and propagates at similar to 50 m s(-1) towards the 200- m- diameter periphery. Episodic shifts of the 20 - 80- m thick dome induce peak forces greater than 10(9) N and reflect surface manifestations of the volcanic long- period earthquakes, a broad class of volcano seismic activity that is poorly understood and observed at many volcanic centres worldwide(7). On the basis of these observations, the abrupt mass shift of solidified domes, conduit magma or magma pads may play a part in generating long- period earthquakes at silicic volcanic systems.},

In this relatively uniform fluid quartz cements grew and developed complex cathodoluminescence (CL) zonations.

Furthermore, Ceres was designed to handle changing geometry through time as results of sedimentation, erosion, salt or mud creeping and block displacement along fault. The classical flow chart to perform a case study is composed of three main steps. The first step is the building of the present day section. This is generally done with data coming from the seismic interpretation, well data, field data and core data. The second step is the restoration of the section. Thus from the section at present day, the section is restored back in the past for each of the defined layer, and until the substratum is reached. The last step is the forward simulation. And, in order to solve the coupled equations that are generally used in basin models, we had to develop original numerical methods based on domain decomposition techniques. The Ceres prototype has now been used to study petroleum systems. It has been used to perform sensitivity studies on fault permeability in the Bolivian foothills and the Congo offshore. In the Gulf of Mexico, it allowed to study the impact of the salt tectonics on the hydrocarbon migration. More recently, the Ceres prototype has been tested, within the frame of the SubTrap consortium, in thrust areas such as the Canadian foothills and the Eastern Venezuelan foothills. For these last case studies, it has been beneficial that structural geologists were involved at all stages of the process.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track analysis yields information on the thermal history of rocks for temperatures < 150�C. The effective closure temperature for fission tracks in apatite is $\sim$ 100�C, but recent developments in projected track length studies also allow us the dating of the $\sim$ 60�C cooling temperature. Projected track length measurements were carried out on apatites from the basement granites of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM), southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, where a previous study had revealed an uplifted, fossil partial annealing zone (PAZ). These measurements confirm the original conclusions reached, namely, that the break in slope in the apatite age profile represents the base of an uplifted PAZ. Furthermore this study provides a test case for not only the PAZ concept in interpretations of apatite age profiles, but also for the use of projected track lengths in determining the $\sim$ 60�C cooling temperature. It is therefore possible to locate the-position of the base and top of a fossil PAZ by use of the $\sim$ 100 and $\sim$ 60�C cooling ages. Model predictions of the PAZ concept for tectonics indicate that the break in slope, such as seen in the TAM, only approximates the onset of uplift. The true time of initiation of uplift was somewhat earlier because samples uplifted from near the base of the fossil PAZ are further annealed as they pass through the PAZ to the zone of full track stability.},

The uplift distribution can be reproduced using a thin elastic plate model and assuming that the uplift is created by a deep buoyant load, the distribution of which coincides with the weakening. Models incorporating a lithospheric weakening provide a better fit of the observed uplift than models with homogeneous flexural rigidity.

suggests continuous inversion heralded in the Late Hauterivian and continuing into Palaeogene
times. The following phases of increased intensity are identified: 1) latest Santonian, 2) Mid Cam-
panian, 3) late Maastrichtian, 4) Late Paleocene – Eocene, and 5) Early Oligocene. Phases 1 through
3 are Sub-Hercynian, phase 4 is Laramide, and phase 5 is Pyrenean according to Alpine Orogen
nomenclature. A temporal change in structural style is noted from early inversion confined to
narrow zones associated with reverse faulting along pre-existing normal faults to late inversion
dominated by gentle basinwide flexuring and folding. Inversion phases in the Danish Central
Graben seem to be synchronous with inversion phases along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone. The
location of inversion is generally spatially linked to Upper Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous depocentres,
whereas older depocentres generally have remained intact.
   The origin of the compressional stress field is generally based on suggested compressional
stresses transmitted into the foreland from the Alpine Orogen. In the Sub-Hercynian phase, orogenic
compression dominated the Eastern Alps and Northern Carpathians to produce a likely NW ori-
ented compression. However, structures in Denmark rather suggest a transpressional environ-
ment resulting from NNE–SSW compression. Furthermore, transmission of Alpine orogenic stresses into the foreland commenced in the Turonian, a considerable time after the Late Hauterivian and later inversion precursors. Ridge-push forces transmitted from sea-floor spreading south of the Charlie-Gibbs fracture zone, particularly from the Goban Spur SW of Ireland, acting in conjunction with Alpine orogenic stresses are suggested as the cause for the stress field.},

abstract = {Palaeo-heat flows and thicknesses of eroded Carboniferous overburden in the coal-bearing Ruhr basin (western Germany) were estimated using one-dimensional basin modelling techniques. Thermal and burial histories for 11 localities were calibrated by comparing measured and calculated vitrinite reflectance data, based on the assumption of pre-tectonic maturation. In contrast to former studies, the kinetic EASY%R0 approach applied for the calculation of vitrinite reflectance. Lopatin's TTI algorithm was used in addition for one well in order to demonstrate the impact of the selection of the algorithm for vitrinite reflectance calculation on the simulation results. Simulated palaeo-heat flows for the time of maximum burial (most probably in the Stephanian) range from 64 to 83 mW/m2 and decrease towards the south. These heat flows are lower than values computed during earlier studies, but are still relatively high in comparison to recent foreland basins. The regional distribution of palaeo-heat flows indicates that the crust beneath the Ruhr basin was relatively thin and thickened towards the south at the end of the Carboniferous. After the Stephanian, 2200-3500 m of Carboniferous overburden were eroded. An observed southward increase in eroded thicknesses is caused by an uplift of the area studied, which decreased towards the north, at the end of the Variscan folding. Large thicknesses of deposited (and later eroded) Carboniferous sediments have to be postulated to explain the maturity data even along the present southern margin of the Ruhr basin. This indicates that the late Carboniferous sediments originally extended far to the south. Geological arguments suggest that the deposition of Carboniferous sediments in the entire Ruhr basin continued until the Stephanian.},

annote = {The common observation of sedimentary basin inversion in orogenic forelands implies that rifts constitute weak areas of the continental lithosphere. When compressed, the rifts respond with uplift of the deepest parts and erosion of sediments therein. Simultaneously, syn-compressional marginal troughs are formed flanking the inversion zone.


Since rifting and subsequent post-rift thermal re-equilibration are processes expected to alter the long-term mechanical state of the lithosphere, the phenomenon of basin inversion is non-trivial from a rheological point of view. Stochastic modelling of the long-term thermal structure beneath sedimentary basins indicates that the crustal part of a rift is warmer, and hence weaker, than the surrounding crustal blocks. In contrast, the mantle part is cold and strong beneath the basin centre.
In this paper, it is investigated whether the rifting-induced strength alterations constitute a sufficient condition for a thermally equilibrated rift to invert by compression. Numerical experiments with two-dimensional dynamic thermo-mechanical models are performed. In particular, the focus is on rifting-related mechanical instabilities that reduce the load bearing capacity of the lithosphere. In the experiments, strain-softening behaviour is introduced in the non-associated plasticity model representing brittle yielding. The result is self-consistent large-scale fault formation.
The models predict that the rifting-related necking instability induces differential crustal thinning increasing the post-rift crustal weakness. Strain softening and the associated fault formation amplifies the necking instability and introduces zones of structural weakness exposed for compressional re-activation.
Under these circumstances, basin inversion follows as a natural consequence of rift compression.},

abstract = {Abstract   Carbonate-hosted lead–zinc ore deposits in the Mississippi Valley region of North America and in the central midlands region
of Ireland provide good examples where ancient groundwater migration controlled ore formation deep within sedimentary basins.
Hydrogeologic and geochemical theories for ore genesis are explored in this paper with mathematical models that allow for
complex permeability fields in two or three dimensions, hydrothermal flows in fault systems, and coupled effects of geochemical
reactions. The hydrogeologic framework of carbonate-hosted ores is analyzed with the aim of developing a quantitative understanding
of the necessary and sufficient processes required to form large ore deposits. Numerical simulations of basin-scale hydrodynamics
and of deposit-scale reactive flow are presented to demonstrate the processes controlling low-temperature Pb–Zn ore genesis
in two world-class ore districts, in southeast Missouri, USA, and central Ireland.

The numerical models presented here provide a theoretical basis for the following observations: (1) topography-driven brine
migration was the most effective mechanism for forming the large ore districts of the Mississippi Valley, such as the Viburnum
Trend of southeast Missouri, during the uplift of the Appalachian–Ouachita mountain belt in late Paleozoic time; (2) three-dimensional
flow fields were created by a dolomite facies of the Viburnum Trend, which acted as a giant lens for focusing metal and heat
in southeast Missouri to produce the largest known concentration of lead in the Earth's crust; (3) ore-mineralization patterns
were controlled locally by basement relief, permeability structure, and sandstone pinchouts, because of their effects on cooling
and fluid-flow rates along the Viburnum Trend; (4) both density-driven and topography-driven fluid flow were important for
ore genesis in the Irish midlands, where brines moved northward away from the Variscan orogen, leaked into the Hercynian basement,
and discharged along normal faults up into the sedimentary cover; and (5) mixed convection within northeast–southwest fault
planes elevated heat flow and flow rates that fed ore deposition by fluid mixing, in some cases near the Carboniferous seafloor
in Ireland.},

abstract = {An understanding of the processes of continental rifting is fundamental to understanding the evolution of the continents. Considerable evidence exists to suggest that continental rift zones are associated with high heat flow and elevated lithospheric geotherms, but direct heat-flow measurements from young rifts do not clearly define surface heat-flow anomalies associated with deep-seated thermal processes in these rifts. The first detailed compilation of heat-flow data from the Neogene Kenya rift is presented here. Heat-flow data are presented from traditional heat-flow determinations in water drill-holes, from bottom-hole-temperature measurements in oil wells, and from heat-flow estimates from groundwater silica data. These data define generally low heat flow on the flanks of the Kenya rift, with high, but variable heat flow on the rift floor. There is a spatial association among high heat-flow values, Quaternary volcanism and faulting, and hydrothermal manifestations on the rift floor. We interpret these results to suggest that any deep-seated thermal anomaly associated with the Kenya rift has not yet been conducted to the surface. The high heat-flow values are interpreted to result from heat advected into the axial rift zone with local redistribution of this heat by hydrothermal convection. Normal to moderately high heat flow was measured in eastern Kenya between the rift zone and the coast. The regional heat flow in eastern Kenya is interpreted to be normal, with local shallow modification by groundwater flow eastward from the Kenya dome. These interpretations support a model of relatively young evolution of the asthenospheric anomaly beneath the Kenya rift zone, with the age of heating of the mantle at the Mono no older than about 10 Ma.},

abstract = {Thermal modeling down to great depth, e.g. down to the Mohorovicic discontinuity, requires representative values of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity at an appropriate depth. Often there is a lack of data, especially concerning temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity, due to missing or questionable data from boreholes. Studies of the temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity showed that temperature is dominating. Thus measurements on a set of magmatic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks sampled from different depth levels of the Eastern Alpine crust were used to obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of both properties–at least for the area of investigation–and to give a review of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity ([lambda]), thermal capacity ([rho]xcp) and thermal diffusivity ([kappa]) for different types of rock. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity for crystalline (magmatitic and metamorphic) rocks is different to that of sedimentary rocks. Using the approach that the thermal resistivity (1/[lambda]) is a linear function of temperature whose slope increases with [lambda](0), the conductivity at a temperature of 0 [degree sign]C, two general equations were determined. The equation for crystalline rocks was verified in the temperature range of 0-500 [degree sign]C and the equation for sedimentary rocks was tested in the temperature range from 0 to 300 [degree sign]C. A general equation for the temperature dependence of [lambda] for Eastern Alpine rocks can thus be formulated:with empirical constants and corresponding uncertainties a=0.0030+/-0.0015 and b=0.0042+/-0.0006 for crystalline rocks. The constants for corresponding sedimentary rocks are a=0.0034+/-0.0006 and b=0.0039+/-0.0014. [lambda] is given in W m-1 K-1, T in [degree sign]C. At ambient conditions thermal diffusivity ([kappa]) and thermal conductivity ([lambda]) for Eastern Alpine crystalline rocks show the relationship:[kappa]=0.45x[lambda].},

abstract = {The Dutch national research programme into the feasibility of retrievable storage of radioactive waste (CORA Programme Phase I; CORA: Comit{\'{e}} Opslag Radioactief Afval = Committee on Radioactive Waste Disposal) examined the suitability of Tertiary clay deposits for such storage. Long-term isolation – up to 1 million years – of high-level radioactive waste under varying conditions is essential.A key concern is the hydro-mechanical response of the clay deposits in which radioactive waste might possibly be stored, in particular during glacial climate conditions as has happened repeatedly in the Netherlands during the Pleistocene.To evaluate this possibility hydro-mechanical computer simulations and mechanical laboratory experiments have been performed to analyse the effects of glacial loading by a thousand-metre-thick ice sheet on the permeability characteristics, fluid flow rates and the associated migration of radio-nuclides both within and out of Tertiary clays. Glacial loading causes the expulsion of pore water from deeply buried clay deposits into adjoining aquifers.The rates and duration of the consolidation-driven outflow of water from the clay deposit, are very sensitive to the permeability of the clay and the dynamics of the advancing ice sheet.The maximum outflow rate of pore water is 1 mm per year.This rate is approximately three times faster than the flow rate of water in clay prior to ice loading. These preliminary simulation studies also indicate that cyclic loading can result in more rapid migration of radio-nuclides in clays. In clay deposits that are covered by a thick ice sheet, the contribution of dispersed transport relative to the total transport by diffusion amounts to 14%, assuming that there is no absorption of radio-nuclides by the clays and a longitudinal dispersivity of 50 m.},

Owing to the lack of unclipped near-source records, however, the source depth as well as the high-frequency signal contents are only known to within large uncertainties. Using a stochastic simulation technique, site-dependent synthetic acceleration seismograms and simulated Wood-Anderson records for the Roermond Earthquake were calculated for the epicentral region and a site in 60 km distance. For the distant site, three different damping models were modelled while for the epicentral region, a tertiary and quaternary coverage of 1500 m was assumed. Both constant- and frequency-dependent Q were considered. the resulting simulations were tested for their consistency with (a) epicentral acceleration between 1.0 and 2.0m sec22122 as indicated by the low observed epicentral intensities of slightly above VII, (b) the observed peak ground accelerations at a distance of 50-60 km which are reported to be 0.3 � 0.1 m sec22122, and (c) the observed Wood-Anderson magnitude of MWA2248 5.9�0.2. While the stochastic simulation does not result in a single unique model, it allows the comparison of certain models (including their uncertainties) in terms of their consistency with the observations. the most pronounced result shows that of the three different source depths (13, 21 and 25 km) which were investigated, the shallow source is by a wide margin the least consistent with the observations, independent of the remaining model assumptions. On the other hand, peak accelerations of 0.3 � 0.1 m sec22122 in 50-60km distance can be explained by reasonable combinations of seismic moments and corner frequencies for all the site-damping models. While under the constant-Q assumption, the most consistent M0/fc combinations show a clear trade-off between fc and M0 for M02248 (5-10) � 1016 Nm, this trade-off is strongly reduced if Q is assumed frequency dependent as Q=Q0�f03B1. For an average seismic moment of M0= 7.5 � 1016 Nm, a corner frequency of 1.020131.25 Hz provides the maximum joint consistency scores independent of the other model assumptions.},

Northwest European lowlands. Recharge of the groundwater system due to basal glacial melting is deduced from ice sheet model simulations driven by a transient climate function. Results of the large-scale model study show relatively high groundwater velocities and pressures in the subglacial areas and the ice-marginal permafrost areas. Extreme high velocities may develop when the ice sheet has advanced to the southern margins of the upper Plio/Pleistocene aquifer in Northwest Europe. Drainage of the highly pressurized groundwater system mainly occurs in proglacial ice-dammed lakes, ice-marginal seas and zones of discontinuous permafrost, including river valleys.},

abstract = {The Mesozoic grabens and wrench induced troughs of Western and Central Europe developed in response to Triassic to Early Cretaceous intra-plate tensional stresses which affected the Arctic -- North Atlantic and the Tethys borderlands during the rifting phases preceding the opening of the respective oceans. During the Alpine orogeny, collision-related compressive stresses exerted on the foreland induced the reactiviation of pre-existing fracture systems, and caused the inversion of Mesozoic grabens and the uplifting of major basement blocks at distances up to 1300 km to the north of the present Alpine deformation front. The structural style of these inversion structures is indicative of compression and transpression. Total crustal shortening is unlikely to exceed a few tens of kilometres. These displacements require a coupling between the foreland and the orogen at the Alpine A-subduction zones and, within the foreland, a decoupling at intra-crustal levels between the crust and mantle and/or at deeper lithospheric levels.},

abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to show that groundwater is a general geologic agent. This perception could not, and did not, evolve until the system nature of basinal groundwater flow and its properties, geometries, and controlling factors became recognized and understood through the 1960s and 1970s. The two fundamental causes for groundwater's active role in nature are its ability to interact with the ambient environment and the systematized spatial distribution of its flow. Interaction and flow occur simultaneously at all scales of space and time, although at correspondingly varying rates and intensities. Thus, effects of groundwater flow are created from the land surface to the greatest depths of the porous parts of the Earth's crust, and from a day's length through geologic times. Three main types of interaction between groundwater and environment are identified in this paper, with several special processes for each one, namely: (1) Chemical interaction, with processes of dissolution, hydration, hydrolysis, oxidation-reduction, attack by acids, chemical precipitation, base exchange, sulfate reduction, concentration, and ultrafiltration or osmosis; (2) Physical interaction, with processes of lubrication and pore-pressure modification; and (3) Kinetic interaction, with the transport processes of water, aqueous and nonaqueous matter, and heat. Owing to the transporting ability and spatial patterns of basinal flow, the effects of interaction are cumulative and distributed according to the geometries of the flow systems. The number and diversity of natural phenomena that are generated by groundwater flow are almost unlimited, due to the fact that the relatively few basic types are modified by some or all of the three components of the hydrogeologic environment: topography, geology, and climate. The six basic groups into which manifestations of groundwater flow have been divided are: (1) Hydrology and hydraulics; (2) Chemistry and mineralogy; (3) Vegetation; (4) Soil and rock mechanics; (5) Geomorphology; and (6) Transport and accumulation. Based on such a diversity of effects and manifestations, it is concluded that groundwater is a general geologic agent.},

abstract = {A set of preferred geotherms for the continental crust is calculated using assumptions of steady state conductive heat transfer. The calculations use observed heat flow as the principal constraint, temperature and pressure dependent thermal conductivity functions, and a radiogenic heat generation profile that is consistent with a generalized petrological model of the lithosphere. Properties of these geotherms include: (1) a nearly constant gradient through the upper crust because the decrease in thermal conductivity at higher temperatures for felsic rocks counteracts the decreasing heat flow caused by crustal radioactivity; (2) divergence of the geotherms amounting to temperature differences of more than 500 K between rifts and shields at Moho depths, and (3) convergence of geotherms below 250 km in the asthenosphere as convective heat transfer dominates. Emphasis is also placed on understanding the sensitivity of calculated temperatures to measureable properties. Computed geotherms are overall most sensitive to surface heat flow or reduced heat flow, and uncertainties in this quantity will ultimately limit the accuracy of temperature estimations for the deeper crust and lithosphere. Otherwise, the sensitivity to parameters such as heat production, thermal conductivity and its temperature dependence throughout the lithosphere and crustal thickness depends on depth and whether the region is characterized by high or low heat flow. Upper mantle heat production, pressure coefficients of thermal conductivity, and the position of the upper/lower crust boundary are relatively insensitive parameters for lower crustal temperature calculations. Dynamic events accompanying crust forming processes lead to significant perturbations of the steady state static temperature field described above. Pressure-temperature pairs from granulite terrains plot near high temperature limits for those steady state geotherms and imply either a transient P-T-t path or a magmatic heat input from the mantle accompanying crustal thickening.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis and modelling of apatite fission track with vitrinite reflectance (VR) data allows the timing, magnitude and pattern of Palaeogene subsidence and Neogene inversion to be established for an uplifted and largely denuded basin: the Buller Coalfield, New Zealand. At the time of maximum subsidence in the late Oligocene, the basin consisted of an extensional half graben, bounded to the west by the Kongahu Fault Zone (KFZ), with up to 6 km of upper Eocene to Oligocene section adjacent to it; currently, only a few tens of metres of basal coal measures on basement are preserved on top of a range 80020131000 m above sea level. Integrated modelling of the VR and fission track data show that the deepest parts of the basin were inverted during two Miocene compressional phases (24201319 Ma and 1320138 Ma), and are consistent with a further phase of inversion during the Quaternary that formed the present topography. Palinspastic restoration of the three phases of inversion shows that the basin was not inverted in a simple way: most of the rock uplift/denudation adjacent to the KFZ occurred during the early Miocene phase, and at the same time burial occurred in the south-eastern part of the basin (maximum temperatures were experienced at different times at different places in the basin); during the middle to late Miocene there was broad uplift in the central and eastern parts of the coalfield. Because the timing and magnitude of uplift have been derived from the zone of inversion, they can be compared independently with the timing of unconformity development and rapid subsidence in the adjacent foredeeps, particularly the Westport Trough. For the middle to late Miocene phase of inversion, we show that during the first 120132 million years of compression, the uplift within the coalfield also involved the margins of the Westport Trough, contributing to unconformity development; subsequently, uplift continued on the inversion structure but the margins of the Westport Trough subsided rapidly. This is explained by a model of stick slip behaviour on the boundary faults, especially for the KFZ. When compression started the fault zone has locked and uplift extends into the basin, whereas subsequently the fault zone unlocks, and the inversion structure overrides the basin margin, thereby loading it and causing subsidence.},

The Apeldorn gas field is located on an inverted western rim of the Lower Saxony Basin (LSB) and belongs with its relatively anomalous nitrogen content of 73.9 vol. % to one of the most unique gas accumulations in North Germany. Based on thermal calibration studies utilising both, vitrinite reflectance and corrected bottom hole temperatures as calibration parameters, a shallow burial model and an anomalous event of Coniacian high heat flow of 80 to 120 mW/m2 was derived. As result, Lower Triassic and younger successions became subjected to slight changes in thermal maturity as opposed to Carboniferous and Permian successions, which show no assessable impact of the high heat flow event on the coalification pattern. The deep burial model in contrary to the shallow burial model is not supported by the structural reconstruction and backstripping in this more marginal setting. According to the modelling results, the key charge of the present Apeldorn gas field began in Tithonian (late Upper Jurassic) during the major phase of rifting in the Lower Saxony Basin. The present Westphalian coal-derived gas accumulations of the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein reservoir were sourced directly from modelled methane pools at top Rotliegend level. The hydrocarbon potential of the Westphalian source rocks became exhausted in Oxfordian (early Upper Jurassic). Reduction of the hydrostatic pressure during the Coniacian high heat flow event together with uplift during the Coniacian-Santonian inversion led to an extensive free gas exsolution. The resulting gas mixture between the exsolved free gas and the Westphalian coal-derived gas reached and saturated Buntsandstein reservoir. The structural trap became destroyed in course of the inversion leading to a sharp decrease of methane and nitrogen saturation.},

abstract = {All Dutch rift basins that formed during Jurassic and Early Cretaceous extension have been inverted during the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. Several inversion pulses occurred more or less simultaneously in all basins. Analysis of vitrinite reflectance data, in combination with fission track and fluid inclusion data show that the magnitude of uplift and erosion generally did not exceed 2 km. Inversion was strongest in the Broad Fourteens, Central Netherlands and West Netherlands basins. The direction of maximum compressive stress was generally not at right angles to the pre-existing fault trends, and resulted in transpressional movements. Within the NW-SE striking basins, dextral strike-slip movements can often be interpreted, which is consistent with a general N-S to NNW-SSE direction of maximum compression related to Alpine structural events. Where no Zechstein salt is present, trends of flower structures formed through reverse reactivation of pre-existing faults. Where the Zechstein salt is thick, re-activated faults could not breach the salt, and a broad uplift of the post-salt succession resulted, while faulting below the salt caused acceleration of halokinesis. In area where the Zechstein salt was thin, and where the offsets of reverse faults exceeded the thickness of the salt, impressive thrusts with the Zechstein salt as detachment horizon developed. The later Tertiary inversion pulses did not affect all basins, and caused broad basin uplift in the West and Central Netherlands basins while individual faults were no longer reactivated. It appears that due to crustal thickening during the first inversion pulses the crust could become stabilised such that further compression could only be accommodated by broad basin uplift.},

abstract = {The Lower Saxony Basin (LSB) is situated at the southern rim of the Northern Permian Basin, the most important hydrocarbon-bearing province in Europe. In its southern part, areas of high thermal maturation (up to 6% Rr) occur which were previously explained as being caused by magmatic intrusions of Turonian to Santonian age that affected Carboniferous to Lower Cretaceous rocks. In this area, 2D numerical basin modelling was carried out in order to reconstruct the temperature histories along two parallel, N-S-trending seismic sections. Along these sections, new data about maturity distribution and temperature history were obtained by vitrinite reflectance measurements and apatite fission track analysis. For the areas with highest maturity values, low coalification gradients were established which agree well with earlier published data on wells further towards the west. This new information does not support previous hypotheses on high heat flows from magmatic intrusions, even if lateral heat transport is taken into account. Instead, comparisons with a recently published map of the subsurface structure of the LSB indicate that maturity distribution may be closely related to major tectonic structures. Deep burial of individual structures of the LSB, which are bordered by deep E-W- to ESE-WNW-trending faults is further suggested by (a) rapidly increasing thicknesses of preserved Cretaceous strata towards the south and (b) structural restoration of one of the seismic sections. To achieve a fit between measured and calculated palaeo-temperature and vitrinite reflectance data, deep burial of Carboniferous source rocks during Cretaceous time has to be assumed. Due to an inversion phase in the early and middle Upper Cretaceous, major amounts of sediment were removed and further uplift occurred in Tertiary times. In contrast, the northern part of the LSB experienced maximum burial and temperatures during Tertiary times.},

abstract = {Heat flow in active tectonic zones as the Baikal rift is a crucial parameter for evaluating deep anomalous structures and lithosphere evolution. Based on the interpretation of the existing datasets, the Baikal rift has been characterized in the past by either high heat flow, or moderately elevated heat flow, or even lacking a surface heat flow anomaly. We made an attempt to better constrain the geothermal picture by a detailed offshore contouring survey of known anomalies, and to estimate the importance of observed heat flow anomalies within the regional surface heat output. A total of about 200 new and close-spaced heat flow measurements were obtained in several selected study areas in the North Baikal Basin. With an outrigged and a violin-bow designed thermoprobe of 2-3-m length, both the sediment temperature and thermal conductivity were measured. The new data show at all investigated sites that the large heat flow highs are limited to local heat flow anomalies. The maximum measured heat flow reaches values of 300-35000 mW/m2, but the extent of the anomalies is not larger than 2 to 4 km in diameter. Aside of these local anomalies, heat flow variations are restricted to near background values of 50-70 mW/m2, except in the uplifted Academician zone. The extent of the local anomalies excludes a conductive source, and therefore heat transport by fluids must be considered. In a conceptual model where all bottom floor heat flow anomalies are the result of upflowing fluids along a conduit, an extra heat output of 20 MW (including advection) is estimated for all known anomalies in the North Baikal Basin. Relative to a basal heat flow of 55-65 mW/m2, these estimations suggest an extra heat output in the northern Lake Baikal of only 5%, corresponding to a regional heat flow increase of 3 mW/m2. The source of this heat can be fully attributed to a regional heat redistribution by topographically driven ground water flow. Thus, the surface heat flow is not expected to bear a signal of deeper lithospheric thermal anomalies that can be separated from heat flow typical for orogenically altered crust (40-70 mW/m2). The new insights on the geothermal signature in the Baikal rift once more show that continental rifting is not by default characterized by high heat flow.},

Ordinary least-squares linear regression model statistical tests (sequence of signs, regression using sequential subsets of an ordered array of data, and residual sum of squares) were used to evaluate the actual relationship between the bottom-hole temperature and the time functions of the methods. The statistical tests for linearity and the resulting residual sum of squares show that bottom-hole temperature versus time-function relationships are of polynomial type. Standard deviation values of the slope and intercept were calculated for the linear as well as the quadratic regression model. The quadratic regression was found to be most appropriate for this purpose and was used for the first time for calculating static formation temperatures using four data sets of actual geothermal borehole logs and two synthetic sets. The F- and Student-t tests were applied to static formation temperatures obtained from linear and quadratic regression methods. Static formation temperatures computed with the spherical and radial heat-flow method are significantly greater (at the 95 per cent confidence level) than those from the other two methods under study. The spherical and radial heat-flow method seems to overestimate 'true' values of the static formation temperatures by about 10 per cent, whereas the other two methods (Horner and cylindrical heat source) provide unbiased estimates of these temperatures.},

abstract = {The kinematic field of central western Europe is characterized by relatively small movements (around 1-2 mm/year) and diffuse seismicity with earthquakes occurring mostly in the shallow crust (within 15 km), prevalently concentrated along the Alps and the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS). In order to study and constrain the current crustal kinematic field we reconstructed the velocity and the strain field using permanent GPS stations, belonging to different networks (AGNES, EUREF, REGAL, RGP). The 2D strain rate tensor has been calculated using the method of least-squares collocation. Our results show that the area of maximum compression is located along the Alpine chain, where maximum values of 7 +/- 2 nstrain/year are found, while maximum extension is measured between the Armorican Massif and the Massif Central, where values of 4 +/- 2 nstrain/year are reached. The earthquakes with M \textgreater 3.0, have been used to estimate the seismic strain rates, while the style of the seismic deformation was reconstructed from the fault plane solutions (FPS) available from the literature. Relatively high values of seismic strain rates (around 10 nstrain/year) are measured along the Alpine Chain and the ECRIS. Results obtained by geodetic and seismic data are quite in agreement and reflect the different tectonic evolution of the geological features characterizing the area of study. The orientation of the compressional geodetic and seismic strain axes are NW-SE in most of the area of study, on account of the action of plate boundary forces. A rotation of the same axes to N-S direction along the eastern Alps, possibly related to the Adria convergence, is found.},

abstract = {Heat is of fundamental importance in the genesis of continental rift zones. Heat flow data are available from the Baikal, Basin and Range (North America), East African, Rhine and Rio Grande rift systems, and most of the data indicate high heat flow, with means of 70-125 mW m-2, from the grabens in the rift systems. Data from the essentially non-volcanic sections of the East African rift system indicate normal to low heat flow, however. With the exception of the Basin and Range system, and parts of the Rio Grande system, the high heat flow appears to be restricted to the grabens, and is not measured on the broad domal or plateau uplifts associated with the rift systems. The uplifts associated with rifts typically are on the order of 1 to 2 km, with diameters of a few hundred kilometers or more, and the duration of the main phase of uplift is on the order of a few tens of million years, or less. These broad uplifts probably result from thermal changes in the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Two thermal models of the lithosphere are developed for comparison with the heat flow and uplift data. The first model assumes very slow lithospheric thinning so that the lithosphere remains in a state of quasi-equilibrium during the thinning. The second model assumes that thinning occurs at a rate significantly faster than heat can be conducted into the base of the lithosphere, with thermal relaxation of the lithosphere occurring after the cessation of thinning. Comparison of uplift rates with the model results indicates that for uplift purposes in rift genesis, the lithosphere is in a state between the two models i.e. partial heating of the lithosphere, or close to the rapid thinning state. Some uplift is predicted to continue after thinning has ceased due to thermal relaxation in the lithosphere. With respect to surface heat flow, however, the rapid thinning model is always predicted to apply, and a surface heat flow anomaly is not predicted to develop until after thinning has stopped. Local (graben) heat flow anomalies are thought to be primarily due to convection of heat into the rift zones by ascending magmas. A regional conducted thermal anomaly is not predicted to develop until after uplift is essentially complete. These predictions are compatible with the available heat flow and uplift data.},

abstract = {Abstract Detailed information on the hydrogeologic and hydraulic properties of the deeper parts of the upper continental crust is scarce. The pilot hole of the deep research drillhole (KTB) in crystalline basement of central Germany provided access to the crust for an exceptional pumping experiment of 1-year duration. The hydraulic properties of fractured crystalline rocks at 4 km depth were derived from the well test and a total of 23100 m3 of saline fluid was pumped from the crustal reservoir. The experiment shows that the water-saturated fracture pore space of the brittle upper crust is highly connected, hence, the continental upper crust is an aquifer. The pressure-time data from the well tests showed three distinct flow periods: the first period relates to wellbore storage and skin effects, the second flow period shows the typical characteristics of the homogeneous isotropic basement rock aquifer and the third flow period relates to the influence of a distant hydraulic border, probably an effect of the Franconian lineament, a steep dipping major thrust fault known from surface geology. The data analysis provided a transmissivity of the pumped aquifer T = 6.1 x 10-6 m2 sec-1, the corresponding hydraulic conductivity (permeability) is K = 4.07 x 10-8 m sec-1 and the computed storage coefficient (storativity) of the aquifer of about S = 5 x 10-6. This unexpected high permeability of the continental upper crust is well within the conditions of possible advective flow. The average flow porosity of the fractured basement aquifer is 0.6-0.7% and this range can be taken as a representative and characteristic values for the continental upper crust in general. The chemical composition of the pumped fluid was nearly constant during the 1-year test. The total of dissolved solids amounts to 62 g l-1 and comprise mainly a mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl; all other dissolved components amount to about 2 g l-1. The cation proportions of the fluid (XCa approximately 0.6) reflects the mineralogical composition of the reservoir rock and the high salinity results from desiccation (H2O-loss) due to the formation of abundant hydrate minerals during water-rock interaction. The constant fluid composition suggests that the fluid has been pumped from a rather homogeneous reservoir lithology dominated by metagabbros and amphibolites containing abundant Ca-rich plagioclase.},

abstract = {Methods for dating shallow faults in the Earth's crust are still evolving and their reliability remains controversial. Based on results from well-preserved fault gouge samples from the AlpTransit deep tunnel site in Switzerland, we propose a simplified and readily applicable approach to investigate and date clay-rich gouge zones. We collected 10 samples covering a north-south section of 15 km. All sampled faults are developed in orthogneiss host rock, have a rather consistent approximately northwest-southeast strike, are mainly normal, and are related to northeast-southwest orogen-parallel extension during Alpine exhumation. Fine-grained clay separates from the fault gouges consist of illite 1M/1M and 2M polytypes, smectite and chlorite, with minor amounts of feldspar in some sample fractions. The K-Ar ages for <2 $\mu$m illite fractions range between 7.1 and 9.5 Ma (mean 8.5 ± 1.4 [2$\sigma$] Ma) and for <0.1 $\mu$m range between 3.9 and 7.2 Ma (mean 6.0 ± 2.1 [2$\sigma$] Ma); ages consistently decrease with grain size. These ages are close to published apatite fission track ages of ca. 6 Ma from the immediate vicinity, consistent with illite stability in fault gouges generally occurring at temperatures slightly above the partial annealing zone of apatite. The influence on authigenic illite gouge ages of potential contamination by fine-grained cataclastic protolith was evaluated by dating coarse K-feldspar fractions from host-rock clasts in two samples. The K-feldspar ages are significantly older, ca. 13.5 Ma. However, measured illite K-Ar ages are quite constant and do not correlate with amount of K-feldspar impurity, which suggests that fine-grained cataclastic feldspar grains have isotopically reequilibrated, presumably due to fluid-rock interaction within the fault zone.},

abstract = {The Rhinegraben is the central segment of a rift system which traverses Western Europe from the North Sea to the Mediterranean. Rifting, which had started in the Middle Eocene, was preceded by early-Teriary nephelinitic eruptions. The center of maximum subsidence shifted along the graben axis from south to north during geologic times. The maximum thickness of sedimentary fill is observed in the northern part of the Rhinegraben to be as much as 3350 m. Most of the internal and external faults are normal faults. By theoretically returning the dip-slip movements and tilted block tectonics back to their original positions a lateral gap can be calculated in the amount of 4.8 km. The graben shoulders began to rise along the marginal fault scarps as outward tilted blocks contemporaneously when fault trough subsidence set in. The graben sinking and shoulder uplift are still in progress. Rates of annual vertical movements up to 0.7 mm, as well as seismic activity, are observed. Below both graben and shoulders a cushion-shaped body has been ascertained, intercalated between crust and mantle, with P-velocities of 7.6–7.7 km s-1. This body is interpreted to be of mantle-derived material; its crest follows the graben axis and ascends up to 24 km beneath the graben floor. It is thought that rifting, like graben subsidence and shoulder elevation, is controlled by the formation and growth of this laccolithic body. Tensional tectonics and sideward plate movements are reduced to gravity slide of the torn and upwarped crustal plates or sub-plates, decoupled from the substratum by heat transfer and consequential partial melting along the cushion surface. The lateral offsets at the transitions from the Rhinegraben to its continual segments are intersected by transversal zones of enhanced seismicity and volcanic action. The observed fault patterns are interpreted as crustal traces of subcrustal transform faulting. Rhine graben tectonism is discussed as to its local interference and temporal interaction with Alpine orogenesis, just as in its causal and spatial connection to the world rift system as a whole, Several arguments pertaining to the understanding of the driving mechanisms are discussed and a new model of rift tectonics is indicated.},

abstract = {After a short-lived but very successful phase of exploration in the UK North Sea, the need for extreme confidentiality ceased to exist for those fields that had already been discovered, including the gas fields of the southern North Sea; this led to a widespread dissemination of data from 1974 onwards, to the great benefit of the industry as a whole. Early difficulties in producing gas from reservoirs whose permeability had been reduced by the growth of diagenetic illite led to studies in depth- and facies-related diagenesis, which continues today in different parts of the Southern Permian Basin. A change from analogue to digital recording of seismic data coincided with improvements in computer technology, and transformed seismic from a tool with limited depth penetration, which required the skill of a dedicated specialist to interpret, to one that today is used universally by all exploration and production geologists; these advances led, in turn, to much improved stratigraphic and structural resolution.  Recent studies, especially in the former East Germany, have led to a better definition of the Permian. In Central Germany, Lower Rotliegend volcanics are overlain by sedimentary sequences of the Muritz sub-group (Upper Rotliegend 1), which are coeval coveal part of the combined Altmark and Saalian Unconformity. In northern Germany, this major hiatus is overlain by the Havel and Elbe subgroups (Upper Rotliegend 2) which, together with the succeeding Zechstein sequences, were all deposited within the youngest stages of the Permian, covering a probable time span of no more than 16 Ma. Deposition of up to 4000 m or so of Late Permian strata in such a short time indicates structurally controlled subsidence in addition to any of a thermal nature.},

abstract = {We present a two-layered finite difference model for the flexural response of the lithosphere to extensional faulting. The model allows for three modes of flexure: (1) fully coupled, with the upper crust and mantle welded together by the lower crust; (2) fully decoupled, with the upper crust and mantle behaving as independent layers; and (3) partly decoupled, signifying that the response of the upper crust to small-wavelength loads is superimposed on the response of the entire lithosphere to long-wavelength loads. Which of these modes of flexure is to be expected depends on the rheology and especially the thermal state of the lithosphere. Coupled behaviour is related to a cold and strong lithosphere. The Baikal Rift Zone provides a typical example for this mode of flexure. A fully decoupled lithosphere is an exceptional case, related to anomalous high temperatures in the lower crust, and is observed in the Basin and Range province. The most common case is a partly decoupled lithosphere, with the degree of decoupling depending on the thickness and viscosity of the lower crust. This is inferred, for example, for the Bay of Biscay margin.},

abstract = {Data analysis in combination with 2D basin modelling is used to study the hydrogeologic and hydrodynamic response of the basin fill of the Broad Fourteens Basin to its geodynamic evolution and the significance of this response for the evolution of the petroleum systems in the basin. Data analysis resulted in the identification of the major mechanical processes involved in overpressure and fluid flow evolution in the basin (sedimentary loading and unloading, tectonic compression and extension, topography of the groundwater table) and provided a timeframework for the important permeability alterations in the basin and the distinct phases of fluid flow. Observed present-day diagenetic features and fracture characteristics in the basin indicate permeability alterations and paleo fluid flow during distinct periods of tectonic activity in the basin, e.g. during Late Jurassic rifting and Late Cretaceous inversion. The basin boundary fault zones were repeatedly reactivated during the periods of tectonic activity. The 2D basin modelling included sedimentary loading and unloading, topography of the water table and petroleum generation as pressure and fluid flow influencing mechanisms. In addition, the influence of time-dependent permeability of fault zones on the overpressure history and the evolution of petroleum systems was modelled and evaluated. The favoured modelling scenario, including a time-dependent permeability of faults, shows that syn-rift and post-rift sedimentation in combination with gas generation induced overpressured conditions in restricted parts of the basin, that is mainly in the deeper low permeable Carboniferous shales and Zechstein evaporites. The calculated pre-inversion overpressured conditions disappear during subsequent inversion of the basin. Predicted present-day pressures in the reservoir horizons are near-hydrostatic and reasonably in accordance with observed pressures. The favoured scenario also explains the known location of oil fields, and the location and saturation characteristics of the gas occurrences. The model results further show that the difference in timing of oil charging of the P9 and Q1 Lower Cretaceous reservoirs explains the observed differences in geochemical composition of the accumulated oils. The biodegraded and water-washed nature of the Late Cretaceous charged Q1 oil reservoir is consistent with the concentrated topography-induced groundwater flow through Lower Cretaceous reservoir units during the Late Cretaceous inversion period. Late charging of the Lower Cretaceous oil reservoir in the P9 area explains the non-biodegraded character of the accumulated oils. In general, this paper shows the importance of using data analysis to obtain an a priori characterization of the basin geofluid evolution and shows that paleohydrodynamic conditions and time-dependent permeability of the hydrogeological framework have influenced significantly the petroleum systems in the basin.},

Temperature was found to be the most important parameter, and track-annealing data are given for each material. Hydrostatic pressures up to 80 kb have practically no effect on annealing curves of zircon and olivine. Track annealing in tektites can be accelerated only upon application of an hydrostatic pressure much larger than would ever be encountered by even a well-buried tektite. Purely hydrostatic pressures do not accelerate track annealing in micas, but shear deformations can shorten, distort, or erase tracks. Large doses of ionizing radiation (other than extremely massive nuclear particles) have no effect on track stability in any of the materials. Tracks formed at 77�K have the same appearance as tracks formed at room temperature or higher.},

abstract = {Investigation of material from three core sections of the RWTH-1 drill-hole in the Wurm syncline of Aachen, Germany, shows mineralogical and structural evidence of intensive hydrothermal activity in the footwall of the Aachen thrust. Mineral and microstructural data indicate minimum temperatures of 200-250{degrees}C. CISillite 001 values of 0.45-0.61 ({Delta} {degrees}2{theta}) and insignificant amounts of smectite indicate a late diagenetic grade for illite pointing to temperatures <200{degrees}C. Chlorite, mainly formed in veins and cleavage planes, has CISchlorite 002 values between 0.35 and 0.26 ({Delta} {degrees}2{theta}) which only in part point to anchizonal grade. In contrast to these illite and chlorite data, maximum temperatures up to 370{degrees}C can be expected based on comparison with recently published fluid inclusion and mineral thermometric data. Illite is neither significantly affected by the hydrothermal event nor by deformation, and mirrors the burial history of the Wurm syncline. Chlorite grew syntectonically as is shown by bent and predominantly stretched sheets which do not, however, have deformed structures. Syntectonic hydrothermal growth by incipient nucleation along crystal edges limited domain size and thus also the CISchlorite 002 values. The hydrothermal event did not last long enough to allow further crystal growth. The retarded CISillite and CISchlorite grades can be best explained by limited duration (probably <5000 y) of the hydrothermal event which for a short time reached epithermal temperatures. The hydrothermal fluid flow was caused by dewatering of sedimentary rocks during thrusting and tectonic thickening within the Variscan orogen and it was focused along the Aachen thrust which represents the frontal Variscan thrust.

abstract = {Fluid flow and deformation in regions of fractured rock around extensional faults have been modelled using distinct element methods (UDEC code). The basic methodology is described in terms of a simple model of a planar normal fault zone, at the Earth's surface. The model is then modified to simulate deformation at greater depths and to investigate irregularities in fault shape (including dilational and anti-dilational fault jogs). The results obtained show that the deformation of a faulted region resulted in significant variation in fracture dilation (porosity), stress distribution, fluid pressure and fluid flow. The geometry of models and the applied boundary conditions had important effects on deformation and fluid flow. At shallow depth, dilation and fluid flow occurred both in the fault zone and the hangingwall, with little change in the footwall. At greater depth, the higher compressive stresses tended to close all fractures, except within the fault zone where the shear displacements caused local dilation. The presence of anti-dilational bends reduced the dilation and fluid flow in the fault zone, but promoted greater deformation in parts of the hangingwall. The dynamic response of fracture aperture, pore pressure and shear displacement to fault slip was also studied. The modelled results are in reasonable correspondence with observed natural examples and have practical significance for evaluating fluid flow and deformation in regions which exhibit normal faulting.},

abstract = {Detrital thermochronometer data collected from modern rivers or sedimentary basins have the potential to record the evolution of topographic relief, fault kinematics and erosion within drainage basins. However, few studies have addressed the effects of these different factors on detrital thermochronometer age distributions. Here we use transient 3-D thermokinematic and landform evolution models to simulate the effects of time-varying topography and fault kinematics on the thermal field through which detrital samples cool. Cooling-rate-dependent apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe), zircon fission track and muscovite 40Ar/39Ar (MAr) grain age distributions are predicted for samples collected from modern river and basin sediments. These distributions are interpreted to determine the sensitivity of different thermochronometer systems to denudation and deformation histories in drainage basins of varying size. We find that detrital thermochronometers in rapidly eroding regions have a strong sensitivity to the kinematics of exhumation, but lack sensitivity to changes in topographic relief under most conditions. In addition, we find potential for significant overestimation of denudation rates derived from conventional 1-D age-elevation relationships as compared to 3-D model-prescribed rates. At rapid ({\^{a}}ˆ¼2.5 mm/y) model-prescribed denudation rates, 1-D techniques predict rates that are {\^{a}}ˆ¼5 and {\^{a}}ˆ¼2 times greater than the 3-D model rate for the AHe and MAr systems, respectively. In models that explore age distributions in foreland basin sediments, we confirm that the lag time concept is a useful and reliable means for identifying denudation rate changes as no significant change in lag time occurs for changing topographic relief scenarios.},

abstract = {The Southern Vosges host a large volcano-sedimentary basin which contains clastic sediments of Famennian (Late Devonian; ca. 365 Ma) to Late Visean (ca. 340-335 Ma) age. The basin is bordered by an exhumed high-grade basement complex and intruded by several granitoid plutons. A chronology for basin evolution and magmatism was established dating volcanic rocks of the basin as well as cross-cutting granitoid rocks by the UPb technique applied to zircon and titanite: The basin evolution started with olistolithic deposits and overlying marine shales that have a Famennian fauna (ca. 365 Ma) and contain detrital zircons with an age of 386 Ma. The lowermost rhyolite flows interlayered with the basin sediments and tholeiitic basalts yielded an age of 345 ± 2 Ma. Following a tectonic event at the bottom of the Upper Visean, the rates of sedimentation and volcanism were strongly enhanced, leading to basin emersion, and were concluded by the extrusion of the uppermost ignimbrite (Molkenrain rhyolite) emplaced at 340 ± 2 Ma. The whole volcano-sedimentary association was subsequently intruded by melts of the Ballons and Creˆtes granites as well as by small monzodioritic and dioritic satellite intrusions along the border of the Ballons granite within 3 ± 2 myr (342 ± 1 to 339.5 ± 2.5 Ma). The zircons of most of the volcanic and plutonic rocks investigated contain inherited lead of 0.6 and 2.1 Ga age. The differences in initial Nd isotopic composition of the Ballons and Creˆtes granites can be explained by differential uptake of crustal material during magma genesis. The precise age data prove that magmatism and basin formation in the Southern Vosges were extremely short-lived and coeval to the exhumation of adjacent high-grade gneiss terrains, revealing an episode of extension at the end of the Lower Carboniferous between 345 and 340 Ma (Visean). The tectonic regime in the internal part of the Variscan orogen is that of extension and strike-slip, while convergent tectonics were still ongoing in the external part of the Variscan orogen.},

abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology is based on progressive resetting of (U-Th)/He ages by heating, with total loss of helium occurring at temperatures around 80 to 90°C (over geological timescales). Using this technique, Thermal History Reconstructions derived from AFTA and vitrinite reflectance can be further refined, allowing improved precision on the timing information of paleo-thermal events at relatively low temperatures (\textless80°C). Published apatite (U-Th)/He ages from Otway Basin wells have been interpreted by other workers as suggesting inconsistencies between measured data and thermal histories derived from AFTA. However, the thermal histories used in those studies were not sufficiently well-defined to provide a meaningful comparison. In this study, detailed thermal history reconstructions in seven wells, based on new AFTA data combined with vitrinite reflectance data, provide a more rigorous framework. Results show excellent agreement between predicted and measured ages. As well as demonstrating that helium diffusion behaviour in laboratory conditions can be extrapolated to geological conditions with confidence, these results confirm that many parts of the Otway Basin have undergone Late Tertiary exhumation, beginning at \textasciitilde10 Ma. This is highly consistent with the recognition of a major Late Miocene unconformity across SE Australia, with a recent synthesis of geological evidence suggesting that this represents a major erosional episode. The improved definition of the timing and magnitude of paleo-thermal episodes provided by this integrated approach results in enhanced definition of areas where timing of oil generation post-dates formation of structures, resulting in more efficient exploration. Results from the Otway Basin illustrate this point well.},

Using a model of radioactivity decreasing exponentially with depth A(z)=A0 exp(-z/D), with A0=2[mu]Wm-3 and D=10km, we computed generalized one-dimensional, steady-state, conductive temperature-depth curves for the major tectonic units of Europe. The available information on the heat flow-tectonic age. heat flow-heat generation and heat flow-crustal thickness relationships were summarized and discussed in terms of crustal structure. The Mohorovicic discontinuity is clearly not an isothermal surface, neither is the outflow of heat from the upper mantle constant, but both parameters may vary within broad limits. The Moho-temperature can be as low as 280[degree sign]C in the shield areas; however, it can exceed 900[degree sign]C in some young intrarnontane depressions or rift structures. Regional variations of the Moho heat flow can be as large as 30-40 mWm-2. The value of the Moho-temperature reflects primarily the tectonic stabilization of the crust as a result of the deep-seated processes in the upper mantle.},

abstract = {There is little doubt that sediments of Upper Jurassic to lowermost Lower Cretaceous age, particularly those of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation and its equivalents, are the source of the vast bulk of the oil in the Central and Northern North Sea. This is true both of oil in conventional Mesozoic plays and in Tertiary clastic reservoirs. The timing of oil generation and migration ranges from the Late Cretaceous through to the present. The oil productivity of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation in the Central Graben, Moray Firth and South Viking, Graben areas of the North Sea is estimated to be in excess of 250 billion barrels, of which about 25% is accounted for in accumulations discovered to date. There is strong areal differentiation between oil trapped in Mesozoic reservoirs as opposed to Upper Cretaceous Chalk and Tertiary reservoirs. This paper is particularly concerned with hydrocarbons in Tertiary reservoirs, which have a wide range of compositions and appear to have complex accumulation and degradation histories. Migration to Chalk and younger Tertiary reservoirs occurs often through thick shale sequences. The evidence for the timing and mechanism of this process is considered and a preferred model for the vertical migration and subsequent lateral migration, mixing and degradation is proposed.},

abstract = {Heating due to lateral introduction of hot fluids is becoming an increasingly recognized feature of the thermal histories of sedimentary basins. In some basins, heating by fluids may have an important effect on hydrocarbon source rock maturation history, so that quantification of the magnitude and timing of heating become essential elements in hydrocarbon prospectivity. In other cases, determining the time of fluid heating in a reservoir may provide a key constraint on hydrocarbon migration history. Examples are presented using AFTA apatite fission track analysis and vitrinite reflectance (VR) data to identify and quantify fluid heating in well sequences from several regions. In the West of Shetland region, in the vicinity of the Rona Ridge, non-linear palaeotemperature profiles defined by AFTA and VR results provide evidence of local heating shallow in the section. AFTA timing constraints suggest introduction of heated fluids produced by nearby Tertiary intrusive activity, although the time constraints are broad because of the low maximum palaeotemperatures involved (R0max \textless 0.6%). In a well from Asia, transient maximum palaeotemperatures \textgreater 120degreesC resulted in R0max \textgreater 0.6% in an Eocene section, with AFTA constraining the fluid flow event responsible for the early to mid Miocene (25 to 10 Ma). On the North West Shelf of Australia transient fluid flow associated with hydrocarbon leakage, and possibly charge, has been previously identified by a combination of AFTA, VR and fluid inclusion homogenization temperature (Th) results. In the East Swan-2 well, a fracture inclusion in quartz from shallow Eocene sandstones gives a minimum Th value of 88degreesC, c. 40degreesC higher than the present temperature. AFTA and VR data show no direct evidence of sustained heating at such a temperature, and can only be reconciled if the duration of heating was c. 20 000 years. The results are consistent with this event being associated with passage of a hot brine and hydrocarbon fluid (O'Brien and Woods, 1995). These case studies demonstrate that a combination of thermal history tools can be used to identify and quantify the thermal effect of fluid flow, potentially allowing much tighter constraints on hydrocarbon generation and migration histories.},

During the mid-Jurassic the central North Sea underwent a temporary doming stage. Crustal extension peaked during the Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous, abated subsequently and terminated altogether during the Paleocene. The saucer-shaped Cenozoic post-rift basin straddles the axis of the Viking and Central grabens. This speaks for the applicability of a depth dependent pure shear model rather than a simple shear model. Geophysical data indicate an important discrepancy between upper and lower crustal attenuation across the North Sea rift, suggesting that during rifting processes the Mono-discontinuity was seriously destabilized. This requires a basic modification of currently favoured crustal stretching models.},

abstract = {The Bolivian Sub-Andean Zone (SAZ) corresponds to a Neogene thrust system that affects an about 10-km thick Palaeozoic to Neogene siliciclastic succession. The analysis of macro and microstructures and cement distribution in thrust fault zones shows that they are sealed by quartz at depths \textgreater 3 km, due to local silica transfer by pressure-solution/precipitation activated at temperatures \textgreater70-90 [degree sign]C. At shallower depths, faults have remained open and could be preferential drains for lateral flow of carbonate-bearing fluids, as shown by the occurrence of carbonate cements in fractures and their host-sandstone. Due to decreasing burial, resulting from foothill erosion during fault activity, critically buried fault segments can be affected by non-quartz-sealed structures that post-date initial quartz-sealed structures. The integration of textural, fluid inclusion and isotopic data shows that carbonates precipitated at shallow depth (\textless3 km), low temperature (\textless80 [degree sign]C) and relatively late during the thrusting history. Isotopic data also show that precipitation occurred from the mixing of gravity-driven meteoric water with deeper formation water bearing carbonate carbon derived from the maturation of hydrocarbon source rocks (Silurian and Devonian shales). The combined microstructural and isotopic analyses indicate that: (i) fluid flow in fault zones often occurred with successive pulses derived from different or evolving sources and probably related to episodic fault activity, and (ii) at a large-scale, the faults have a low transverse permeability and they separate thrust sheets with different fluid histories.},

abstract = {A quantitative procedure has been developed for calculating tectonic subsidence in fully lithified strata and has been applied to stratigraphic sections in the early Paleozoic miogeocline of the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains. The results indicate that tectonic subsidence along the inner edge of the miogeocline was controlled mainly by thermal contraction of heated lithosphere. Comparison of a palinspastically restored cross section of the inner part of the miogeocline with a cross section constructed from a two-dimensional stretching model suggests that thinned continental crust was present beneath the inner miogeocline. These results support the passive-margin model that has been proposed for the miogeocline. The extensive transgression onto the craton east of the miogeocline in Cambrian time, however, cannot be explained by subsidence processes operating within a passive margin, and the transgression could be evidence for a eustatic rise of sea level.The form of the tectonic subsidence curves strongly implies that cooling of the heated lithosphere, which was initiated at the time of breakup, could not have begun earlier than the latest Precambrian or earliest Cambrian (555 Ma to 600 Ma). Ages of 800 Ma to 900 Ma that have been assumed previously for rifting in the miogeocline are too old to have led directly to continental breakup. Scattered occurrences of mafic volcanics interlayered with arkosic sediments have been reported in the latest Precambrian to earliest Cambrian Hamill Group exposed in the middle to outer part of the miogeocline. These deposits may record the phase of rifting that immediately preceded formation of the proto-Pacific margin in the southern Canadian Rockies.},

abstract = {We apply a recently developed 3D flexure model incorporating lateral variations in flexural rigidity (EET) and necking depth (zn) to study the 3D effects of intraplate stresses on Quaternary accelerated subsidence and uplift in the North Sea Basin and adjacent areas. In the model approach lateral variations and magnitude of predicted Quaternary vertical motions are largely dependent on the pre-existing Late Tertiary flexural state of the area and the relative change in magnitude and orientation of intraplate stresses in the Quaternary. The Late Tertiary deflections are reconstructed by incorporating lithospheric stretching values calculated from the Mesozoic subsidence record, and by adopting admissible variations in necking depth (zn) and flexural rigidity (EET) from earlier work. The 3D model results for the North Sea and adjacent areas indicate that an increase of compressive intraplate forces with a magnitude of about 2.25 x 1012 N/m can predict accelerated subsidence values up to 700 m, largely in agreement with observed patterns of Quaternary isopach values corrected for effects of shallowing waterdepth. The magnitude of the intraplate forces is 2 to 3 times lower than predicted by earlier 2D studies. It is believed that the 2D model results actually overestimate required stress levels, since they do not take into account the effect of out-of-plane stresses. The relative increase in compressive forces is in agreement with observed compressive stresses and the magnitude corresponds to characteristic values for plate boundary forces. The adopted values for zn and EET do not show a clear relation with the preceding basin history.},

abstract = {Abstract Erosion of orogenic mountain ranges exhumes deeply buried rocks and controls weathering, climate, and sediment production and transport at a variety of scales. Erosion also affects the topographic form and kinematics of orogens, and it may provide dynamic feedbacks between climate and tectonics by spatially focused erosion and rock uplift. Thermochronology measures the timing and rates at which rocks approach the surface and cool as a result of exhumation. Relatively well-understood noble gas and fission-track thermochronometric systems have closure temperatures ranging from 60 to 550oC, making them sensitive to exhumation through crustal depths of about one to tens of kilometers. Thus, thermochronology can constrain erosion rates and their spatial-temporal variations on timescales of 105-107 years, commensurate with orogenic growth and decay cycles and possible climate-tectonic feedback response times. Useful methods for estimating erosion rates include inverting ages for erosion rates using crustal thermal models, vertical transects, and detrital approaches. Spatial-temporal patterns of thermochronometrically determined erosion rates help constrain flow of material through orogenic wedges, orogenic growth and decay cycles, paleorelief, and relationships with structural, geomorphic, or climatic features.},

abstract = {It is proposed that the growth of fractures is the basic process for generating and maintaining permeability in solid rock (bedrock). Many extension fractures grow as hydrofractures, whereas many shear (and extension) fractures grow through the formation of transverse fractures that connect the adjacent tips of existing fractures. In a boundary-element analysis, the hydrofractures are modeled as being driven open by a fluid overpressure that varies linearly from 10 MPa at the fracture centre to 0 MPa at the fracture tip. The host rock has a uniform Young's modulus of 10 GPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.25, and is dissected by vertical joints and horizontal contacts, each of which is modeled as an internal spring of stiffness 6 MPa mm1. The number of joints and contacts, and their location with respect to the hydrofracture tip are varied in different model runs. The results of the analyses indicate that the tensile stresses generated by overpressured hydrofractures open up joints and contacts out to considerable distances from the fracture tip, so that they tend to link up to form a hydraulic pathway. Using the same Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and internal spring constant for joints as in the hydrofracture models, boundary-element models were made to study the interaction stresses that cause neighbouring joints to become interconnected through the growth of linking transverse fractures that, ultimately, may evolve into shear fractures. The models were subjected to tensile stress of 6 MPa acting normal to the joint planes as the only loading. The offset (horizontal distance) and underlap (vertical distance) between the adjacent tips of the joints were varied between model runs. The results show a concentration of tensile and shear stresses in the regions between the neighbouring tips of the joints, but these regions become smaller when the underlap of the joints decreases and changes to overlap. These stress-concentration regions favour the development of transverse (mostly shear) fractures that link up the nearby tips of the joints, so as to form a segmented shear or extension fracture. Analytical results on aperture variation of a hydrofracture in a homogeneous, isotropic rock are compared with boundary-element results for a hydrofracture dissecting layered rocks. The aperture is larger where the hydrofracture dissects soft (low Young's modulus) layers than where it dissects stiff layers. Aperture variation may encourage subsequent groundwater-flow channeling along a pathway generated by a hydrofracture in layered rocks.},

The inversion of the West Netherlands Basin, which is characterized by the doming of the basin centre and by the reactivation of pre-existing faults in a reverse mode, was found to be the result of a continuous inversion process rather than a distinct tectonic pulse. The intensity of the tectonic movements was not uniform throughout the Eocene and was strongest during the Latest Eocene. These characteristics are similar to those of other basins in the southern North Sea region and in the English Channel area. In addition, a good correlation exists between Alpine tectonic events and the Palaeogene inversion phases. In light of these observations the Latest Eocene inversion pulse in the southern North Sea region can be considered as the culmination of a long-term inversion process that originated from the Alpine collision.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous and Tertiary post-rift subsidence history of the northern North Sea and the Faeroe-Shetland Basins, formed by Jurassic and Cretaceous rifting, show substantial departures from McKenzie post-rift subsidence in the Early Tertiary. These departures can be explained by regional Palaeocene uplift, followed by rapid decay of this uplift in the Eocene through to the present day. Forward and reverse 2-D modelling of syn- and post-rift stratigraphy, using flexural isostasy, has been used to determine the magnitude and timing of this uplift event. In the north Sea Basin (NNSB), modelling predicts Palaeocene uplift to have been of the order of 375-525 m, increasing northwards. In the Faeroe-Shetland Basin, Palaeocene uplift is estimated to have been 900 m. The timing of Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB and northern Britain is consistent with the development of the Early Tertiary Icelandic plume (c. 64 Ma) or a related plume. Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB is attributed to dynamic uplift generated by mantle fluid flow driven by ascending hot plume material. Magmatic underplating or buoyancy from heated lithosphere are not believed to be significant mechanisms for regional Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB. The decay of Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB occurs more rapidly than predicted by simple conductive cooling of heated lithosphere. Rapid decay of uplift in the NNSB is attributed to a temperature decrease of the plume in the Early Eocene (c. 55 Ma), resulting in a decrease in dynamic uplift, and coincides with a decrease in volcanic activity within the British Tertiary and Greenland Igneous Provinces, and the initiation of sea-floor spreading between Greenland and northwest Europe. The plume responsible for Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB and northern Britain may have been located in the Faeroe-East Greenland area, although a smaller transient plume within the British Tertiary Igneous Province may also have contributed to uplift.},

The Meseta subsided to >3�km depth during the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic and was exhumed to the surface before the Late Cretaceous, during the rift and post-rift stages of Central Atlantic opening. Erosion of the exhuming rocks is responsible for a thick package of terrigenous sands found in the Moroccan offshore and elsewhere along the NW Africa margin. About 1�km of subsidence affected the Meseta during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene.

abstract = {The slip behavior of major faults depends largely on the frictional and hydrologic properties of fault gouge. We report on laboratory experiments designed to measure the strength, friction constitutive properties, and permeability of a suite of saturated clay-rich fault gouges, including: a 50:50% mixture of montmorillonite-quartz, powdered illite shale, and powdered chlorite schist. Friction measurements indicate that clay-rich gouges are consistently weak, with steady state coefficient of sliding friction of \textless0.35. The montmorillonite gouge ($\mu$ = 0.19–0.23) is consistently weaker than the illite and chlorite gouges ($\mu$ = 0.27–0.32). At effective normal stresses from 12 to 59 MPa, all gouges show velocity-strengthening frictional behavior in the sliding velocity range 0.5–300 $\mu$m/s. We suggest that the velocity-strengthening behavior we observe is related to saturation of real contact area, as documented by the friction parameter b, and is an inherent characteristic of noncohesive, unlithified clay-rich gouge. Permeability normal to the gouge layer measured before, during, and after shear ranges from 8.3 × 10−21 m2 to 3.6 × 10−16 m2; permeability decreases dramatically with shearing, and to a lesser extent with increasing effective normal stress. The chlorite gouge is consistently more permeable than the montmorillonite and illite gouge and maintains a higher permeability after shearing. Permeability reduction via shear is pronounced at shear strains ≲5 and is smaller at higher strain, suggesting that shear-induced permeability reduction is linked to fabric development early in the deformation history. Our results imply that the potential for development of excess pore pressure in low-permeability fault gouge depends on both clay mineralogy and shear strain.},

abstract = {Temperature profiles of 22 observation boreholes in the Ishikari basin were investigated in order to extract information on the ground thermal processes and the associated water flow disturbances. Data analyses methods were based on temperature profile typology, thermal gradient-temperature plots, and a thermo-hydraulic model. The distributed data sets of measured temperature profiles and thermal conductivity show lateral heat flow variations from 34 to 162 mW m-2. These thermal conditions revealed the co-existence of a highland geothermal field, a lowland central subnormal heat flow area, and a strong heat flow anomaly near the northeast Ishikari River. To explain this specific configuration of the thermal field, possible effects of petro-physical properties, topography and groundwater movements were examined with a three-dimensional thermo-hydraulic simulation model. Laboratory measurements of thermal conductivity, porosity, density, and permeability from borehole core samples were used to constrain the model parameters. The main results suggest that: the lateral increase of geothermal gradient and heat flow density with elevation, i.e. in the southwest direction, are essentially due to hydro- and thermo-physical differences between the hydrogeologically active Quaternary sedimentary system and the underlying Tertiary volcano-sedimentary formation; the low heat area in the central lowland may be explained by the effect of its local groundwater flow recharge, and then the positive heat anomaly near the Ishikari River would result from a basin-wide heat flow redistribution by water flow. In general, the thermal regime in the Ishikari basin appears dominated by conduction processes in the southwest area and strongly influenced by advection phenomena in the northeast.

abstract = {Field-based geological studies show that continental deformation preferentially occurs in young tectonic provinces rather than in old cratons1. This partitioning of deformation suggests that the cratons are stronger than surrounding younger Phanerozoic provinces. However, although Archaean and Phanerozoic lithosphere differ in their thickness2, 3, 4 and composition4, 5, their relative strength is a matter of much debate. One proxy of strength is the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te. Unfortunately, spatial variations in Te are not well understood, as different methods yield different results. The differences are most apparent in cratons, where the 'Bouguer coherence' method yields large Te values (\textgreater 60 km)6, 7, 8, 9 whereas the 'free-air admittance' method yields low values (\textless 25 km)10. Here we present estimates of the variability of Te in Europe using both methods. We show that when they are consistently formulated11, both methods yield comparable Te values that correlate with geology, and that the strength of old lithosphere ( 1.5 Gyr old) is much larger (mean Te \textgreater 60 km) than that of younger lithosphere (mean Te \textless 30 km). We propose that this strength difference reflects changes in lithospheric plate structure (thickness, geothermal gradient and composition) that result from mantle temperature and volatile content decrease through Earth's history.},

abstract = {The northern Upper Rhine Graben, situated in the central part of the European Cenozoic rift system, is currently characterized by low intra-plate seismicity. Historical earthquakes have not been large enough to produce surface rupturing. Moreover, the records of Quaternary surface processes and human modifications are presumably better preserved than the record of the relatively slow tectonic deformation.In order to gain information on the neotectonic activity and paleoseismicity in this setting, the geological and geomorphological records of fault movements along a segment of the Western Border Fault (WBF) were studied using an integration of techniques in paleoseismology, structural analysis and shallow geophysics. The WBF segment investigated follows a 20 km long linear scarp of unclear origin. A series of geophysical measurements were performed and the results suggested that near-surface deformation structures are present at the segments' southern end. Several trenches opened at this location revealed fault structures with consistent extensional style and a maximum vertical displacement of 0.5 m. In one trench, the deformation structures were dated between 19 and 8 ka. Assuming the deformation has been caused by an earthquake, a Mw 6.5 earthquake would be implied. Aseismic deformation would point to a fault creep rate ≥ 0.04 mm/yr.A reconstruction of the sequence of events at the trench site, from Middle Pleistocene to Present, demonstrates that the morphology at the base of the scarp is the result of interplay between tectonic activity and fluvial and erosional processes. At the regional scale, a mixed origin for the WBF scarp is proposed, combining the effects of fluvial dynamics, erosion, regional uplift and localized tectonic activity on the WBF.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track length data are used extensively for thermal history inversion. However, several studies have documented instances of poor reproducibility of length data. We address this problem by using c-axis projection to normalize track lengths for crystallographic angle in the extensive laboratory annealing data set acquired by Barbarand et al. (2003a, 2003b). A new simplification reduces the c-axis projection model from six to four fitted parameters. Normalizing for track angle using c-axis projection improves every aspect of length measurement reproducibility examined. It accelerates convergence of mean length in single analyses; increases consistency among replicate measurements by a single analyst; enhances consistency of measurements of the same mounts by different analysts; and improves the match between analyses conducted with and without Cf-irradiation. C-axis projection is also shown to enhance the thermal sensitivity of length data. Based on these results, we assert that c-axis projection is a good means of compensating for observer bias, although it does not overcome differences caused by experimental error.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The attenuation of the continental crust during rifting and the subsequent filling of the rift-related accommodation alter the long-term thermal and mechanical state of the lithosphere. This is primarily because the Moho is shallowed due to density contrasts between the sediment fill and the crust, but also reflects the attenuation of the pre-existing crustal heat production and its burial beneath the basin, as well the thermal properties of the basin fill. Moho shallowing and attenuation of pre-existing heat production contribute to long-term cooling of the Moho and thus lithospheric strengthening, as has been pointed out in many previous studies. In contrast, basin filling normally contributes to significant Moho heating allowing the possibility of long-term lithospheric weakening, the magnitude of which is dependent on the thermal properties of the basin-fill and the distribution of heat sources in the crust. This paper focuses on the thermal property structure of the crust and basin-fill in effecting long-term changes in lithospheric thermal regime, with particular emphasis on the distribution of heat producing elements in the crust. The parameter space appropriate to typical continental crust is explored using a formalism for the heat production distributions that makes no priori assumptions about the specific form of the distribution. The plausible parameter space allows a wide range in potential long-term thermal responses. However, with the proviso that the accommodation created by the isostatic response to rifting is essentially filled, the long-term thermal response to rift basin formation will generally increase average crustal thermal gradients beneath basins but cool the Moho due to its reduction in depth. The increase in the average crustal thermal gradient induces lateral heat flow that necessarily heats the Moho along basin margins, especially in narrow rift basins. Using coupled thermo-mechanical models with temperature sensitive creep-parameters, we show that such heating may be sufficient to localise subsequent deformation in the vicinity of major basin bounding structures, potentially explaining the offset observed in some stacked rift basin successions.},

abstract = {A finite difference model is presented, describing the thermal structure of a region undergoing fault-controlled extension. The model is two-dimensional and time-dependent. We combine temperature changes resulting from conduction, advection due to fault movements, sediment blanketing and heat production. Cooling curves can be derived at chosen points in the area. This study mainly investigates the effect of the extension rate on the thermal field, which turns out to be very important. 20 km of extension with extension rates of 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mm/yr yield maximum deviations in temperatures from the steady-slate situation of 2, 26 and 84%. The sediment blanketing effect can even be reversed by variations in the sedimentation rates. Fast sedimentation leads to crustal cooling, slow sedimentation to crustal heating. The turning-point value is lithology-dependent and corresponds to 2.0 mm/yr for shale, 2.2 mm/yr for clay, and 1.4 mm/yr for sand; a sandstone will cause an increased cooling at both high and low velocities. Our modelling shows that footwall cooling during or immediately after a rifting event cannot be explained by the downwards movement of the adjacent, relatively cold hanging wall. Consequently, in areas where such a cooling is observed, other cooling mechanisms must play an important role. These can be phenomena like footwall uplift or the fading out of an older thermal anomaly.},

abstract = {Abstract A basin model was built to simulate in three dimensions the 248 Myr geological history of the Paris basin, France, i.e. sedimentation, erosion, compaction heat and fluid flow. This multidisciplinary study was based on a detailed stratigraphic database of more than 1100 well logs together with a hydrodynamic database of 1000 data (heads and permeabilities). The region covers a maximum surface area of 700 000 km2. The NEWBAS code of the Ecole des Mines de Paris was used in order to simulate compaction and heat and fluid flow. Three examples of the use of this model are given to illustrate different features of the geological functioning of the basin. (i) By modelling processes such as sedimentation, compaction, fluid and heat flow, the model provides estimates of the hydraulic conductivity fields within one order of magnitude from observations at the regional scale. This permeability field can reproduce the present-day observed pressures and fluxes in the basin. (ii) Observed excess pressures in the main aquitards are considered as possible consequences of the geological history of the basin. The calculated excess pressures are small and stay within the range of the measured values, between 0 and 2.75 MPa, close to the pressures in the aquifers. However, the weak excess pressures measured in the Callovo-Oxfordian sequence in the eastern part of the basin are not reproduced by the model. Mechanisms other than compaction disequilibrium must be invoked. (iii) This model also calculates regional-scale palaeofluid flow whose value is currently arbitrarily assumed by geochemists when studying diagenetic processes. Hence, it provides a hydrologic background for diagenetic models. The cementation in the western Keuper reservoirs was investigated. Topographically driven flow during tectonic inversion periods, e.g. the Lower Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, is shown to be a plausible cause of brine migrations. This brine displacement would then explain the high salinities recorded in the fluid inclusions trapped in the Keuper cements. The conditions for the migration would have been most favourable at the time of the maximum burial, i.e. the Early Tertiary and not the Early Cretaceous as previously suggested.},

In this paper a simple method is presented to determine heat production from normal gamma ray logs which are readily available from a vast number of boreholes. This method is based on a linear relationship between the gamma ray GR and the heat production A. For a wide variety of lithologies extending from granite through gneiss, carbonate and amphibolite to basaltic rocks, it is shown, that this relation is valid in the range 0-350 API and 0.03-7 [mu]W/m3 respectively with an error lower than 10%. Reliable information of the radiogenic heat production for the use in thermal modelling now can be derived quickly using only standard GR (API) readings.},

abstract = {The two German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB) boreholes provided samples for studies of fluid inclusions (paleofluids), “free fluids” of the crystalline basement, and their fingerprints on the chemical and isotopic composition of minerals and rocks to 9101 m depth, which allowed reconstruction of the evolution of fluids, their migration pathways, and their sources. Aqueous fluids were largely lost during the Devonian amphibolite facies metamorphism. Thereafter, radiogenic, nucleogenic, and fissiogenic gases, together with NH4-fixed nitrogen, were released from host rocks and partly enclosed in secondary inclusions. During the Hercynian uplift, Na-Cl fluids (formation water) infiltrated and dissolved noble gases and N2 largely originating from the host rocks. In the course of the Cretaceous denudation, high-salinity Ca-Na-Cl brines, possibly derived from Permo-Carboniferous sediments but altered by fluid/rock interaction, migrated into their present position. This fluid introduced low-maturity hydrocarbons released together with nitrogen from early metamorphic organic-rich sediments. The 4000-m fluid from the KTB pilot hole pumping test, which was analyzed chemically and isotopically, seems to be a mixture of an ascending basement brine and a descending paleometeoric water, from which the late alteration minerals calcite and laumontite precipitated in fractures. The calcite is neither chemically nor isotopically in equilibrium with the recovered “free fluid.” Hydraulic tests indicate a communicating system of fractures between the boreholes with a distinct matrix and fracture porosity.},

abstract = {Structural elements of deformation-band fault zones are implemented as volumetrically expressed building blocks, that is, fault facies, in a series of synthetic reservoir geomodels and simulation models. The models are designed and built to reproduce a predefined range of fault system configuration, sedimentary facies configuration, and fault zone architecture. Using petrophysical properties derived from published field studies, the geomodel realizations are run in a reservoir simulator to monitor reservoir responses to variations in modeling factors. The modeled fault zones act as dual barrier-conduit systems, resulting in simulation models that can capture contrasting waterfront velocities, changes in waterfront geometries, and flow channelizing and bifurcation in the fault envelopes. The simulation models also show the development and sweep efficiency of bypassed oil and poorly swept regions because of the presence of the fault zones. Statistical analysis reveals that the fault facies modeling factors can be ranked according to impact on reservoir responses in the following descending order: fault core thickness, the type of displacement function, sedimentary facies configuration, the fraction of total fault throw accommodated by fault core and damage zones, fault system configuration, and maximum damage zone width. Fault core thickness is the most important factor because it governs the space available for fluid flow in the fault-dip direction. Other modeling factors affect the reservoir responses by controlling the geometry and continuity of fluid flow paths in the modeled fault zones.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the response of a sedimentary basin to compressional reactivation of extensional faults in distinct pulses. The inversion of the Broad Fourteens Basin in the southern Dutch North Sea is used as a case study. The first pulse of inversion occurred during the Late Mesozoic as a result of the sub-Hercynean phase. A second pulse occurred during the Mid-Palaeocene Laramide phase. A final inversion pulse occurred around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary coinciding with the Pyrenean tectonic event. We reconstructed the stratigraphic and structural development of the area during the Palaeogene in detail. Basic data are two 2D-seismic surveys, supported by 74 geophysical wireline logs, on which newly constructed depth and thickness maps are based. The reconstruction is aided by a quantitative subsidence analysis. Cessation of compression resulted in relaxation and tensional reactivation of faults caused differential subsidence. Inheritance of geological structures is a key element in the tectonic activity in the Broad Fourteens Basin during the Palaeogene; tectonic movement during the Palaeogene was always accommodated by reactivation of Palaeozoic-Mesozoic faults. The intensity of inversion in the southern North Sea Basin during the Pyrenean phase appears much larger than previously noticed. Moreover, the area affected by the inversion is much wider than during previous phases. Minor differences in the direction of the local stress field between the tectonic phases and by the deposition of a thick sedimentary succession during the periods of tectonic quiescence between the inversion phases can account for this.},

abstract = {Flow of fluids in sedimentary basins causes transport of heat and dissolved mass and is therefore potentially important in relation to diagenetic reactions. Rather large fluid fluxes are required, however, for this type of transport to be significant in terms of dissolution and precipitation of minerals. Before diagenetic processes are attributed to pore water flow, semi-quantitative calculation of flow rates and duration of flow should be attempted. Heat flow in sedimentary basins is normally dominated by conduction, except on a local scale. The upwards pore water flux due to compaction is on average smaller than the subsidence rate, and the thermal anomalies caused by compaction are moderate in modern basins. Dissolution and precipitation of minerals which are in equilibrium with the pore water occur when the flow is oblique relative to the isotherms. Due to the low solubility/temperature gradient of the common silicate and carbonate minerals, very large fluxes of pore water are required to transport significant volumes of mass in solution. The greatest potential for transporting solids and creating secondary porosity is during meteoric water flow, because the flow rate then may be several orders of magnitude higher than what is typical for compaction-driven flow. Quartz overgrowth corresponding to 3% of the rock volume requires a total flow of 108cm3 cm-2 if the silica is introduced by vertical compaction-driven flow from a source outside the sandstone. Pore water flow precipitating quartz due to cooling will dissolve carbonate cement at a much higher rate. An external import of silica through the flow of water would be expected to cement up the most permeable pathways, such as fractures and well-sorted permeable sand beds. In the case of carbonate cement the solubility gradient is negative and upwards flowing and cooling pore water would cause dissolution rather than precipitation. Also in the case of carbonate rocks, large-scale mass transfer such as dolomitization is easier to explain as occurring at relatively shallow depths rather than during deeper burial. Ore minerals like galena have a steep solubility/temperature gradient, but concentrated precipitation requires rapid cooling of hot water. Such conditions are most likely to be met when hot fluids are cooled near the surface.},

This paper investigates whether the steady-state thermal structure in itself can provide the necessary pattern of rheological weakening to facilitate compressional inversion of a sedimentary basin. By Monte Carlo simulation of a two-dimensional thermal finite element model we find that, generally, the maximum Moho temperature, and therefore also the weakest upper mantle, is encountered beneath the flanks of the basin. The reason for this is heat refraction deviating away from the central parts of the sedimentary cover and into the adjacent basement highs. The weakest crust, however, is located in the center of the basin due to sediment thermal blanketing, lower confining pressure, and the presence of relatively weak sediments.},

abstract = {Fission-track (FT) thermochronology is a tool routinely used for studies of surface denudation because of its sensitivity to the low temperatures found in the uppermost part of the crust. FT ages and associated track length distributions are regularly interpreted assuming a steady-state temperature field and only conductive heat transfer. However, application of the method to thermochronological studies based on such interpretations may lead to invalid conclusions, if the temperatures at a certain depth had actually varied with time. For example, the convective transfer of heat by hydrothermal fluids can cause transient thermal events within the upper crust. In particular, fluid circulation along fault zones can result in substantial convective heat transport and cause temperature anomalies in the adjacent rocks (Zuther & Brockamp 1988, Fleming et al. 1998, Lampe & Person 2002, B{\"{a}}chler et al 2003). As a consequence, any refined interpretation of FT data requires a thorough understanding of the upper crustal temperature field and its evolution through time. The main objective of this study is to assess quantitatively how convective heat transport influences the upper crustal 1 Geologisches Institut, Universit{\"{a}}t Freiburg, Albertstr. 23b, D-79104 Freiburg 2 Geol.-Pal{\"{a}}ont.

Modelling utilizes Finite Element techniques and the software FEFLOW, respectively. Indepth parameter studies (including fault geometry, erosion rate, hydraulic potential, hydraulic and material properties) are conducted on two-dimensional (cross-sectional) models of fault zones. After evaluating the relative importance of different variables relevant to fluid circulation in a palaeogeothermal system, the time-temperature (tT) histories of particle points are tracked as erosion moves them closer to surface. These tT-paths are used in a forward modelling approach to determine the expected FT age and track length distributions. For each parameter study, a corresponding set of FT parameters is produced, thus, providing a catalogue of FT ages and track length distributions, which will help to interpret real data sets. One of the goals of the project is to investigate the regional impact of convectiveheat transport on the interpretation of FT data and other thermal data from the Black Forest (SWGermany). The modelling techniques outlined above will be applied to field data from the Baden-Baden and Offenburg troughs in the northern and central Black Forest.

The past 2 decades have seen steady growth of computational power and the development of numerical models that have eliminated or minimized the need for various simplifying assumptions. Considerable heuristic insight has been gained from process-oriented numerical modeling. Recent modeling efforts employing relatively complete EOS and accurate transport calculations have revealed dynamic behavior that was damped by linearized, less accurate models, including fluid property control of hydrothermal plume temperatures and three-dimensional geometries. Other recent modeling results have further elucidated the controlling role of permeability structure and revealed the potential for significant hydrothermally driven deformation. Key areas for future research include incorporation of accurate EOS for the complete H2O-NaCl-CO2 system, more realistic treatment of material heterogeneity in space and time, realistic description of large-scale relative permeability behavior, and intercode benchmarking comparisons.},

abstract = {The relationship between fracturing and fracture filling in opening-mode fractures in the Triassic Buntsandstein in the Lower Saxony Basin (LSB; NW Germany) has been studied by an integration of petrographic and structural analysis of core samples, strontium isotope analysis and microthermometry on fluid inclusions. This revealed the relationship between the timing of the fracturing and the precipitation of different mineral phases in the fractures by constraining the precipitation conditions and considering the possible fluid transport mechanisms. The core was studied from four different boreholes, located in different structural settings across the LSB. In the core samples from the four boreholes, fractures filled with calcite, quartz and anhydrite were found, in addition to pore-filling calcite cementation. In boreholes 2 and 3, calcite-filled fractures have a fibrous microstructure whereas in borehole 1, fractures are filled with elongate-blocky calcite crystals. Anhydrite-filled fractures have, in all samples, a blocky to elongate-blocky microstructure. Fractures that are filled with quartz are observed in borehole 2 only where the quartz crystals are 'stretched' with an elongated habit. Fluid inclusion microthermometry of fracturing-filling quartz crystals showed that quartz precipitation took place at temperatures of at least 140�C, from a fluid with NaCl2013CaCl22013H2O composition. Melting phases are meta-stable and suggest growth from high salinity formation water. Strontium isotopes, measured in leached host rock, indicate that, in boreholes 2 and 3, the fluid which precipitated the calcite cements and calcite-filled fractures is most likely locally derived whereas in borehole 1, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios from the pore-filling cements and in the elongate-blocky calcite-filled fracture can only be explained by mixing with externally derived fluids. The elongate-blocky anhydrite-filled fractures, present in boreholes 1, 3 and 4, precipitated from a mixture of locally derived pore fluids and a significant quantity of fluid with a lower, less radiogenic, 87Sr/86Sr ratio. Taking into account the structural evolution of the basin and accompanying salt tectonics, it is likely that the underlying Zechstein is a source for the less radiogenic fluids. Based on the samples in the LSB, it is probable that fibrous fracture fillings in sedimentary rocks most likely developed from locally derived pore fluids whereas elongate-blocky fracture fillings with smooth walls developed from externally derived pore fluids.},

In its southwestern part, anomalously high maturity of organic matter has been observed to reach 4.5% VRr in Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in an area which coincides with a magnetic and a positive gravimetric anomaly. This anomaly was often interpreted as the consequence of a deep-seated igneous intrusion, the so-called Bramsche Massif. However, results obtained from calibrated numerical modelling are not in accordance with this scenario. Instead, a burial by approximately 4 km of now-eroded Cretaceous rocks was revealed to be the probable cause for the anomaly.

abstract = {In the area of the Cenozoic Rhine rift system, crustal and lithospheric thicknesses range between 24 and 35 km, and 60 and 120 km, respectively. This rift system transects the deeply truncated Variscan Orogen and superimposed Permo-Carboniferous wrench-induced troughs, and Late Permian and Mesozoic thermal sag basins. At the time of its Westphalian consolidation, the Variscan Orogen was probably characterized by 45-60 km deep-crustal roots that were associated with its Rheno-Hercynian-Saxo-Thuringian, Saxo-Thuringian-Bohemian and Bohemian-Moldanubian sutures, all of which are transected by the Cenozoic Rhine rift system. During the Stephanian-Early Permian wrench-induced disruption of the Variscan Orogen, subducted lithospheric slabs were detached causing upwelling of hot mantle material. During the resulting thermal surge, partial delamination and/or thermal thinning of the continental mantle-lithosphere induced regional uplift. At the same time the Variscan orogenic roots were destroyed and crustal thicknesses reduced to 28-35 km in response to the combined effects of mantle-derived melts interacting with the lower crust, regional erosional unroofing of the crust and, on a more local scale, by its mechanical stretching. Towards the end of the Early Permian, the potential temperature of the asthenosphere returned to ambient levels. With this, regional, long-term thermal subsidence of the lithosphere commenced, controlling the development of a new system of Late Permian and Mesozoic thermal sag basins. However, the evolution of these basins was repeatedly overprinted by minor short-term subsidence accelerations that reflect the build-up of far-field stresses related to rifting in the Tethyan and Atlantic domains. Comparison of observed and modelled subsidence curves suggests that in the area of the Rhine rift system the lithosphere had equilibrated with the asthenosphere at the end of the Cretaceous at depths of 100-120 km, before it became thermally destabilized again by Cenozoic rifting and plume-related magmatism. Modelled subsidence curves indicate that by the end of Early Permian times the thermal thickness of the remnant mantle-lithosphere ranged between 10 and 50 km in areas that were later incorporated into Mesozoic thermal sag basins; this corresponds to mid-Permian thermal lithosphere thicknesses of 40-80 km.},

abstract = {Quantitative subsidence analysis for a number of rifted basins in the northern Atlantic/Mediterranean region provides evidence for rapid phases of PlioQuaternary subsidence. The observed acceleration in tectonic subsidence occurs after a phase of general quiescence in subsidence in these basins and deviates from predictions of stretching models. The latter indicate a decay of subsidence with time after Mesozoic-Tertiary basin formatioh and a slow tectonic subsidence in Plio-Quaternary times. A possible explanation for the observed patterns of anomalous subsidence could be an increase in the level of intraplate compression in the northern Atlantic region. Intraplate stress changes in the Plio-Quaternary are related to the dynamics of African/ Eurasian collision processes and a reorganization of spreading directions in the AtlAntic, possibly reflecting a plate reorganization of global nature. It seems that the Plio-Quaternary record reflects a period of increased levels of neotectonic activity, interplaying with periods of (de)glaciation. Stress-induced topography in the onshore parts of continental margins, coupled with the stress-induced subsidence in the offshore deeper parts of the basins, could have contributed to recent phases of uplift in Fennoscandia, augmenting the uplift induced by glacial unloading. Estimates of ice thicknesses are directly inferred from the observed uplift ignoring other driving mechanisms whereas topography plays a crucial role in the dynamics of glaciation. It is, therefore, important to quantdy the interplay of rapid tectonic uplift and subsidence phases with climatic effects during the Plio-Quaternary.},

abstract = {Although the ‘Mid-Cimmerian event' or unconformity has been recognized over much of Europe, its exact stratigraphic relations and causal mechanism have remained unclear. Application of a genetic sequence stratigraphic approach (using 17 marine condensed sections and maximum flooding surfaces) to Jurassic sequences across NW Europe allows the stratigraphic succession to be subdivided into a series of time-slices (genetic stratigraphic sequences) and allows the true nature of the unconformity to be determined. They indicate that the main event's correlative conformity falls in the Aalenian near the break between the  and  ammonite biochronozones. Further study of the associated spatial and temporal variation indicates that systematic truncation of stratigraphy occurred throughout the North Sea domain (the oldest stratigraphies subcrop in areas adjacent to the triple junction) with subsequent progressive onlap towards the same area. When integrated with igneous evidence, these observations are interpreted to confirm regional (Toarcian–Aalenian) domal uplift, resulting from the impingement of a broad-based (> 1250 km diameter), transient plume head or ‘blob' at the base of the lithosphere. Progressive pre-rift, Aalenian–early Bathonian marine onlap records differential subsidence in response to the initial deflation of the dome while central regions may have continued to rise. Subsequent subsidence post-dated Bathonian–Callovian volcanism but still pre-dated the timing of most significant (Kimmeridgian–Volgian) rif},

chondrites and solar abundances(1). Knowledge of the Cl concentrations
and distribution on Earth is essential for understanding the origin of
these depletions. Large differences in the stable chlorine isotope
ratios of meteoritic, mantle and crustal materials have been used as
evidence for distinct reservoirs in the solar nebula(2) and to
calculate the relative proportions of Cl in the mantle and crust(3).
Here we report that large isotopic differences do not exist, and that
carbonaceous chondrites, mantle and crust all have the same Cl-37/Cl-35
ratios. We have further analysed crustal sediments from the early
Archaean era to the Recent epoch and find no systematic isotopic
variations with age, demonstrating that the mantle and crust have
always had the same delta Cl-37 value. The similarity of mantle, crust
and carbonaceous chondrites establishes that there were no nebular
reservoirs with distinct isotopic compositions, no isotopic
fractionation during differentiation of the Earth and no late
(post-core formation) Cl-bearing volatile additions to the crustal
veneer with a unique isotopic composition.},

Estimated mid-depths of upper-mantle thermal sources for the Jemez Lineament and the Rio Grande rift generally agree with the mid-depths of the greatest upper-mantle seismic velocity anomalies, supporting the suggestion that these seismic anomalies are caused in part by increased temperature. Mid-depths of shallower thermal sources are near the mid-depth between the top of the crustal seismic velocity anomaly and the top of the upper-mantle seismic anomaly. Heat flow returns to intermediate values in the Colorado Plateau and the eastern rift flank of the Rio Grande rift, suggesting similar crustal and upper-mantle thermal conditions in the two regions and low values in the Great Plains, indicating cooler crustal and upper-mantle temperatures. Heat-flow values are generally consistent with seismic velocities, although differences between the data sets are observed for the Rio Grande rift eastern flank.},

abstract = {We can deduce thermal conductivities and thermal gradients from extensively available oil exploration data: geophysical well logs, cores, cuttings, formation thicknesses and temperatures. Thermal conductivity is predicted at three significant scales. First, it is computed at the scale of well-log electrofacies (thicknesses from 1 to 10 m) using a geometric mean model calibrated on laboratory measurements made on the main sedimentary rocks—the electrofacies conductivity is calculated as a function of the mineralogy, the porosity and the saturating fluids. Second, it is estimated at formation scale at each well site (thicknesses from 100 to a few thousand meters) using a serial model that accounts for the anisotropy due to sediment stacking and for temperature effects. Finally, for each formation (thicknesses on the order of 1 km), the average conductivity field is mapped at basin scale (extent on the order of 100 km) using a geostatistical treatment accounting for lateral facies and/or porosity changes. For thermal gradient field reconstruction, the systematic errors associated with the drilling history are removed from temperatures (bottom-hole temperatures) using various techniques depending on data quality. The formation thermal gradient fields are then estimated using a stochastic inversion for temperatures and thicknesses, considering lateral correlations between thermal gradients at well sites. The technique is applied to the Norwegian Viking Graben, a multistage rift basin in the North Sea, where previous studies indicate large lateral and vertical variations in thermal conductivity and thermal gradient fields.},

These models have provided important insights into the rates and pathways of groundwater migration through basins, the relative importance of different driving mechanisms for fluid flow, and the nature of coupling between the hydraulic, thermal, chemical, and stress regimes. The mathematical descriptions of basin transport processes, the analytical and numerical solution methods employed, and the application of modeling to sedimentary basins around the world are the subject of this review paper. The special considerations made to represent coupled transport processes at the basin scale are emphasized. Future modeling efforts will probably utilize three-dimensional descriptions of transport processes, incorporate greater information regarding natural geological heterogeneity, further explore coupled processes, and involve greater field applications.},

Here we examine the transition from conduction dominated environments to environments where advection has a significant effect on the subsurface temperature regime and thus ground surface temperature (GST) histories.

abstract = {Seventy chalk samples from four formations in the overpressured Danish central North Sea have been analyzed to investigate how correlations of porosity and sonic velocity with burial depth are affected by varying mineralogy, fluid pressure, and early introduction of petroleum. The results show that porosity and sonic velocity follow the most consistent depth trends when fluid pressure and pore-volume compressibility are considered. Quartz content up to 10% has no marked effect, but more than 5% clay causes lower porosity and velocity. The mineralogical effect differs between P-wave and shear velocity so that smectite-bearing chalk has a high Poisson's ratio in the water-saturated case, but a low value in the dry case. Oil-bearing chalk has up to 25 units higher porosity than water-saturated chalk at similar depth but similar velocity, probably because hydrocarbons prevent pore-filling cementation but not pore-structure stiffening cementation in this presumably water-wet chalk. These results should improve the modeling of chalk background velocity for seismic inversion analysis. When describing the porosity-reducing process, pore-volume compressibility should probably be disregarded when correcting for fluid pressure because the cementing ions originate from stylolites, which are mechanically similar to fractures. We find that cementation occurs over a relatively short depth interval.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The large thickness of Upper Carboniferous strata found in the Netherlands suggests that the area was subject to long-term subsidence. However, the mechanisms responsible for subsidence are not quantified and are poorly known. In the area north of the London Brabant Massif, onshore United Kingdom, subsidence during the Namurian-Westphalian B has been explained by Dinantian rifting, followed by thermal subsidence. In contrast, south and east of the Netherlands, along the southern margin of the Northwest European Carboniferous Basin, flexural subsidence caused the development of a foreland basin. It has been proposed that foreland flexure due to Variscan orogenic loading was also responsible for Late Carboniferous subsidence in the Netherlands. In the first part of this paper, we present a series of modelling results in which the geometry and location of the Variscan foreland basin was calculated on the basis of kinematic reconstructions of the Variscan thrust system. Although several uncertainties exist, it is concluded that most subsidence calculated from well data in the Netherlands cannot be explained by flexural subsidence alone. Therefore, we investigated whether a Dinantian rifting event could adequately explain the observed subsidence by inverse modelling. The results show that if only a Dinantian rifting event is assumed, such as is found in the United Kingdom, a very high palaeowater depth at the end of the Dinantian is required to accommodate the Namurian-Westphalian B sedimentary sequence. To better explain the observed subsidence curves, we propose (1) an additional stretching event during the Namurian and (2) a model incorporating an extra dynamic component, which might well explain the very high wavelength of the observed subsidence compared with the wavelength of the predicted flexural foreland basin.},

Regional measured apatite fission-track ages cluster between 28 and 41 Ma to the south of the Carlin East deposit whereas measured ages are greater than $\sim$56 Ma to the north. The regional trend of the apatite fission-track ages and the pattern of gravity and magnetic anomalies suggest that the thermal center for gold mineralization along the Carlin trend was south of the Carlin East deposit, near the 37 Ma Welches Canyon stock. Modeling of apatite fission-track-age data on both sides of the Post fault indicates that the Little Boulder stock was approximately 35{degrees}C cooler at 40 Ma relative to similarly positioned samples in the Goldstrike stock. It is unclear whether this thermal history difference across the Post fault is due to post-40 Ma differential exhumation or differential heating across the fault at the time of gold mineralization. Comparison of apatite fission-track and whole-rock 40Ar/39Ar ages from altered dikes in the ore zone at Carlin East demonstrates that 40Ar/39Ar ages do not reflect the age of gold mineralization, whereas the apatite fission-track ages were completely reset at the time of hydrothermal activity. (U-Th)/He ages are younger than the inferred mineralization age and may reflect weak hydrothermal activity associated with Miocene volcanism.},

abstract = {The Rio Grande rift is one of the major late Cenozoic continental rifts of the world, sharing most geophysical, geochemical, and geological characteristics with other rifts. Cenozoic evolution of the rift was synchronous with lithospheric plate interactions along and under the western North American margin: Paleocene-Eocene: Laramide primarily amagmatic compression related to flat-slab subduction; Oligocene: intermediate to silicic volcanism related to collapse of the slab; Miocene to present: rifting related to complex plate interactions overprinted on the previous history. Cenozoic paleogeographic and paleotectonic characteristics are consistent with a passive-mantle mode of rifting. North-central New Mexico provides a unique opportunity to constrain models for rift initiation and evolution. It is one of the few locations within any rift where excellently exposed pre-rift and syn-rift basin fill has been studied thoroughly enough to allow detailed paleogeographic reconstruction for almost the entire Cenozoic. Cenozoic paleogeography for the study area is summarized as follows: (1) Eocene (58-37 Ma): a single amagmatic sedimentary basin (El Rito-Galisteo) trended northwest-southeast with Laramide basement uplifts on three sides; (2) early to late Oligocene (37-28 Ma): intermediate magmatism with volcaniclastic aprons derived from the San Juan and Ortiz-Cerrillos volcanic fields, and residual Laramide uplifts; (3) late Oligocene-early Miocene (28-21 Ma): initiation of bimodal volcanism with widely dispersed volcaniclastic aprons derived from the predominantly silicic San Juan and Latir volcanic fields; (4) early to middle Miocene (21-15 Ma): continued volcaniclastic dispersal from silicic volcanic centers, concurrent with initiation of block faulting to form half grabens, internal drainage, and erosion of Phanerozoic strata and Precambrian basement; (5) middle to late Miocene (15-8 Ma): continued deepening of half grabens, widespread exposure of Precambrian terranes, formation of complex depositional environments in basin centers, and continued bimodal volcanism; (6) late Miocene to present (8-0 Ma): concentration of extension in central grabens linked by accommodation zones, major bimodal volcanism (for example, Taos Plateau and Jemez Mountains), regional uplift, and integration of Rio Grande drainage. Dispersal patterns, petrofacies analysis, K-Ar ages, and chemical analyses of volcanic clasts provide details concerning three primary volcanic centers: (1) San Juan Mountains (27-29 m.y., high-K andesite and rhyodacite); (2) Latir volcanic field (25-28 m.y., high-K andesite and rhyolite); and (3) the previously unrecognized Servilleta Plaza center (22-23 m.y., latite, high-K andesite and rhyodacite), which may have been a southern extension of the Latir field. These three volcanic centers provided detritus to the following units, respectively: (1) Esquibel Mbr. of Los Pinos Fm., upper Abiquiu Fm., middle Picuris Fm., Bishops Lodge Mbr. of Tesuque Fm. and volcaniclastic units in the northern Albuquerque basin (Zia and Abiquiu); (2) Cordito Mbr. of Los Pinos Fm. and uppermost Abiquiu Fm.; and (3) Chama-El Rito Mbr. of Tesuque Fm and upper Picuris Fm. Use of petrofacies (1. Esquibel, 2. Cordito, and 3. Plaza) simplifies the chaos of stratigraphic nomenclature and promotes regional correlations of poorly exposed units.},

abstract = {While initial studies showed a high degree of consistency between AFTA and apatite (U-Th)/He dating, an increasing number of studies are reporting apatite (U-Th)/He ages which are older than expected on the basis of apatite fission track data from the same region. We present data from a range of geological settings to document a systematic discrepancy between the two systems, which becomes more pronounced in samples with older fission track ages (except for samples with very low uranium contents). Results from a granite pebble and enclosing volcanogenic sandstone provide a well-controlled test case in which independent constraints are available on the underlying thermal history. These demonstrate that the progressive discrepancy between the two techniques arises not from anomalous fission track annealing behaviour, as has been suggested, but as a result of a change in the He retention properties of apatite. This change appears to be linked to the degree of accumulated radiation damage within the crystal lattice, although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We suggest detailed experiments should be performed to delineate and quantify the processes responsible. Until this is achieved, we suggest that apatite (U-Th)/He studies should also incorporate apatite fission track data, as well as other low temperature indicators, in order to monitor the (U-Th)/He system response and to guard against the anomalous behaviour described here.},

By combining the identification of seafloor spreading anomalies A33o to M0 in the Bay of Biscay with those in the North Atlantic, we have derived a position of a mean pole of rotation for the entire opening of the Bay of Biscay. Four hundred kilometers of shortening took place between the Iberian and Eurasian plates in the Pyrenean domain during the opening of the Bay of Biscay, from chrons M0 to A33o time (118 to 80 Ma). The deep seismic Etude Continentale et Oc{\'{e}}anique par R{\'{e}}flexion et r{\'{e}}fraction Sismique (ECORS) profile shot across the Pyrenees and teleseismic data show the presence of two distinct slabs, which dip to the north. The southern slab is linked to the subduction of the neo-Tethys Ocean, which was created from late Jurassic to early Aptian. Simultaneously, elongated back arc basins formed along the future Pyrenean domain. This slab was active from at least 118 Ma (early Aptian) to 100 Ma (late Albian). The northern slab, active since 85 Ma, is linked to the subduction of the lower continental crust located south of the Pyrenean domain. In the upper crust, normal faults as well as the north Pyrenean fault became reverse faults, and former back arc basins were inverted, giving rise to the uplift of the Pyrenees as a double asymmetrical wedge.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Upper Visean limestones in the Campine Basin of northern Belgium are intensively fractured. The largest and most common fractures are cemented by non-ferroan, dull brown-orange luminescent blocky calcite. First melting temperatures of fluid inclusions in these calcites are around -57oC, suggesting that precipitation of the cements occurred from NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2 fluids. The final melting temperatures (Tmice) are between -5 and -33oC. The broad range in the Tmice data can be explained by the mixing of high salinity fluids with meteoric waters, but other hypotheses may also be valid. Homogenization temperatures from blocky calcite cements in the shelf limestones are interpreted to have formed between 45 and 75oC. In carbonates which were deposited close to and at the shelf margin, precipitation temperatures were possibly in the range 70-85oC and 72-93oC, respectively. On the shelf, the calcites have a delta18O around -9.3% PDB and they are interpreted to have grown in a fluid with a delta18O between -3.5 and +1.0% SMOW. At the shelf margin, blocky calcites (delta18O - 13.5% PDB) could have precipitated from a fluid with a delta18O betweenn -4.0 and -1.1% SMOW. The highest oxygen isotopic compositions are comparable to those of Late Carboniferous marine fluids (delta18O= - 1% SMOW). The lowest values are more positive than a previously reported composition for Carboniferous meteoric waters (delta18O= -7% SMOW). Precipitation is likely to have occurred in marine-derived fluids, which mixed with meteoric waters sourced from near the Brabant Massif. Fluids with a similar negative oxygen isotopic composition and high salinity are actually present in Palaeozoic formations. The higher temperature range in the limestones near the shelf margin is explained by the upward migration of fluids from the 'basinal' area along fractures and faults into the shelf.},

abstract = {Major low-angle normal faults juxtapose different structural levels of the crust that record both brittle and ductile deformation. Field relationships alone cannot establish whether these different responses to deformation represent (1) parts of a single process of exhumation along the detachment or (2) two separate events, with the later, more discrete brittle detachment exhuming a fossil ductile shear zone from depth. These two general models are critically assessed for the low-angle normal Simplon Fault Zone (SFZ) in the central Alps. The SFZ shows a spatial transition from a broad ductile mylonitic shear zone to a discrete brittle detachment with identical kinematics. The age of the ductile shear zone and ductile-brittle transition is controversial. We present a detailed geochronological study based on fission track, 40Ar/39Ar, and Rb/Sr microsampling dating, coupled with structural, petrological, and chemical analyses that provides tight constraints on SFZ timing. Discontinuous mineral cooling ages over a broad range of temperatures across the fault zone argue for fault activity between 20 and 3 Ma. On the basis of synkinematic white mica in low-temperature shear zones and necks of foliation boudinage, the brittle-ductile transition in the footwall could be dated at ∼14.5–10 Ma. Overall, the data presented here are consistent with a continuous transition from ductile shearing to a more localized zone of brittle deformation within the same geological framework, over a period of ∼15 Ma. The SFZ is therefore an example of a telescoped crustal section within a single major low-angle fault, involving a continuous period of exhumation rather than a two-stage structure.},

As a second step, logging data are used to compute a lithological depth profile, which in turn is used to calculate a thermal conductivity profile. From a comparison of the conductivity-depth profile and the laboratory data, it can be concluded that thermal conductivity can be computed with an accuracy of less than from conventional wireline data. The comparison of two different models shows that this approach can be practical even if old and incomplete logging data are used. The results can be used to infer thermal conductivity for boreholes without appropriate core data that are drilled in a similar geological setting.},

abstract = {Global compilations of surface heat flow data from stable, Precambrian terrains show a statistically significant secular change from 41+/-11 mW/m2 in Archean to 55+/-17 mW/m2 in Proterozoic regions far removed from Archean cratons. Using the tectonothermal age of the continents coupled with average heat flow for different age provinces yields a mean continental surface heat flow between 47 and 49 mW/m2 (depending on the average, non-orogenic heat flow assumed for Phanerozoic regions). Compositional models for bulk continental crust that produce this much or more heat flow (i.e., K2O\textgreater2.3-2.4 wt%) are not consistent with these observations. More rigorous constraints on crust composition cannot be had from heat flow data until the relative contributions to surface heat flow from crust and mantle are better determined and the non-orogenic component of heat flow in the areally extensive Phanerozoic regions (35% of the continents) is determined. We calculate conductive geotherms for 41 mW/m2 surface heat flow to place limits on the heat production of Archean mantle roots and to evaluate the significance of the pressure-temperature (P-T) array for cratonic mantle xenoliths. Widely variable geotherms exist for this surface heat flow, depending on the values of crustal and lithospheric mantle heat production that are adopted. Using the average K content of cratonic peridotite xenoliths (0.15 wt% K2O, assuming Th/U=3.9 and K/U=10,000 to give a heat production of 0.093 [mu]W/m3) and a range of reasonable crustal heat production values (i.e., ≥0.5 [mu]W/m3), we calculate geotherms that are so strongly curved they never intersect the mantle adiabat. Thus the average cratonic peridotite is not representative of the heat production of Archean mantle roots. Using our preferred estimate of heat production in the cratonic mantle (0.03 wt% K2O, or 0.019 [mu]W/m3) we find that the only geotherms that pass through the xenolith P-T data array are those corresponding to crust having very low heat production (\textless0.9 wt% K2O). If the lithospheric mantle heat production is higher than our preferred values, the continental crust must have correspondingly lower heat production (i.e., bulk crustal K, Th and U contents lower than that of average Archean granulite facies terrains), which we consider unlikely. If the xenolith P-T data reflect equilibration to a conductive geotherm, then Archean lithosphere is relatively thin (150-200 km, based on intersection of the P-T array with the mantle adiabat) and the primary reason for the lower surface heat flow in Archean regions is decreased crustal heat production, rather than the insulating effects of thick lithospheric roots. On the other hand, if the xenolith P-T points result from frozen-in mineral equilibria or reflect perturbed geotherms associated with magmatism, then the Archean crust can have higher heat producing element concentrations, lithospheric thickness can range to greater depths and the low surface heat flow in Archean cratons may be due to the insulating effects of thick lithospheric roots. An uppermost limit for Archean crustal heat production of 0.77 [mu]W/m3 is determined from the heat flow systematics.},

abstract = {Abstract  The Harz Mountains and the adjacent Subhercynian Cretaceous Basin figure as the most prominent surface representative for Late Cretaceous inversion structures in Central Europe. Facies, depositional architecture and provenance of the basin fill reflect mechanisms and timing of the exhumation of the Harz. From Hauterivian to Early Santonian there is no evidence for detrital input from the nearby Harz area. Sediments are mature quartzarenites derived from Paleozoic basement rocks and/or recycled Permian to Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. This situation changed drastically in Middle to Late Santonian when freshly exhumed and eroded Mesozoic sedimentary cover rocks of the Harz were delivered into the basin. Feldspar and lithoclasts reflect erosion of Triassic and, in places, Jurassic to Turonian strata. Apatite and garnet in heavy mineral spectra are derived from largely unweathered Lower Triassic Buntsandstein as indicated by apatite and garnet chemistry. In Early Campanian, Paleozoic lithoclasts indicate erosion cutting down into the basement of the Harz. Simultaneous strong decrease of feldspar, garnet and apatite suggest an almost complete removal of the 2–3 km thick Mesozoic cover of the Harz within only 2–4 Myr. This translates into an exhumation rate of approximately 1 mm/a consistent with apatite fission track data from granitoid rocks of the Harz Mountains.},

abstract = {Abstract  The development of the Alpine mountain belt has been governed by the convergence of the African and European plates since
the Late Cretaceous. During the Cenozoic, this orogeny was accompanied with two major kinds of intraplate deformation in the
NW-European foreland: (1) the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS), a left-lateral transtensional wrench zone striking NNE-SSW
between the western Mediterranean Sea and the Bohemian Massif; (2) long-wavelength lithospheric folds striking NE and located
between the Alpine front and the North Sea. The present-day geometry of the European crust comprises the signatures of these
two events superimposed on all preceding ones. In order to better define the processes and causes of each event, we identify
and separate their respective geometrical signatures on depth maps of the pre-Mesozoic basement and of the Moho. We derive
the respective timing of rifting and folding from sedimentary accumulation curves computed for selected locations of the Upper
Rhine Graben. From this geometrical and chronological separation, we infer that the ECRIS developed mostly from 37 to 17 Ma,
in response to north-directed impingement of Adria into the European plate. Lithospheric folds developed between 17 and 0 Ma,
after the azimuth of relative displacement between Adria and Europe turned counter-clockwise to NW–SE. The geometry of these
folds (wavelength = 270 km; amplitude = 1,500 m) is consistent with the geometry, as predicted by analogue and numerical models,
of buckle folds produced by horizontal shortening of the whole lithosphere. The development of the folds resulted in ca. 1,000 m of rock uplift along the hinge lines of the anticlines (Burgundy–Swabian Jura and Normandy–Vogelsberg) and ca. 500 m of rock subsidence along the hinge line of the intervening syncline (Sologne–Franconian Basin). The grabens of the
ECRIS were tilted by the development of the folds, and their rift-related sedimentary infill was reduced on anticlines, while
sedimentary accumulation was enhanced in synclines. We interpret the occurrence of Miocene volcanic activity and of topographic
highs, and the basement and Moho configurations in the Vosges–Black Forest area and in the Rhenish Massif as interference
patterns between linear lithospheric anticlines and linear grabens, rather than as signatures of asthenospheric plumes.},

abstract = {The Dutch2014German border region near the city of Roermond, The Netherlands was hit by a rather strong crustal earthquake at 1:20 UT, 1992 April 13. The epicentre is located within the Roer Valley Graben, a region currently undergoing extension. The centroidal source mechanism of this event has been retrieved by moment tensor inversion of broad-band long-period surface waves recorded at regional distances (10020131500 km). The double-couple contribution of the moment tensor corresponds to almost pure normal faulting (rake: 262�) on a steeply south-westward dipping fault (dip: 58�) with a NW-SE trend (strike: 138�). This result is consistent with local tectonics but violates some first-motion P-wave polarity data. The deduced seismic moment is 9.2 � 1016 N m corresponding to a moment magnitude of 5.3. A centroidal depth of 18 km fits slightly better than 13 km; however, the differences are small and other methods are necessary to constrain the depth further. It is now possible to access a number of broad-band three-component seismic stations in Europe via phone line (e.g. German Regional Seismic Network) and the ORFEUS data centre (i.e. Global Digital Seismic Network). This allows retrieval of waveform data immediately after an earthquake. In this paper we present a potentially fast and reliable procedure for extracting the moment tensor from low-frequency surface waves using the Roermond earthquake as an example. Detailed knowledge of the velocity-depth structure along the travel paths seems unnecessary with our procedure. Further testing is required on all future moderate to strong earthquakes in Europe using rapidly accessible stations to investigate the procedure's usefulness and possible limitations as a tool for rapid moment tensor estimation.},

Since a significant proportion of the crustal complement of HPEs is contained within granites, granite generation and emplacement should lead to significant long-term changes in the thermal structure of the crust. Using HPE concentrations appropriate to representative Australian Proterozoic granites we show that granite segregation leads to changes in the temperature field of the crust of up to c. 50 oC, producing long-term cooling in the source regions and heating at emplacement levels, relative to the pre-granite conductive thermal regime. Because of the intimate connection between thermal regime and lithospheric strength, granite-assisted redistribution of HPEs is likely to be fundamental to cratonisation.},

abstract = {The Great Basin region in the western United States contains active geothermal systems, large epithermal Au-Ag deposits, and world-class Carlin-type gold deposits. Temperature profiles, fluid inclusion studies, and isotopic evidence suggest that modern and fossil hydrothermal systems associated with gold mineralization share many common features, including the absence of a clear magmatic fluid source, discharge areas restricted to fault zones, and remarkably high temperatures (>200 °C) at shallow depths (200–1500 m). While the plumbing of these systems varies, geochemical and isotopic data collected at the Dixie Valley and Beowawe geothermal systems suggest that fluid circulation along fault zones was relatively deep (>5 km) and comprised of relatively unexchanged Pleistocene meteoric water with small (<2.5‰) shifts from the meteoric water line (MWL). Many fossil ore-forming systems were also dominated by meteoric water, but usually exhibit $\delta$O fluid-rock interactions with larger shifts of 5‰–20‰ from the MWL.
Here we present a suite of two-dimensional regional (100 km) and local (40–50 km) scale hydrologic models that we have used to study the plumbing of modern and Tertiary hydrothermal systems of the Great Basin. Geologically and geophysically consistent cross sections were used to generate somewhat idealized hydrogeologic models for these systems that include the most important faults, aquifers, and confining units in their approximate configurations. Multiple constraints were used, including enthalpy, $\delta$O, silica compositions of fluids and/or rocks, groundwater residence times, fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures, and apatite fission track anomalies.
Our results suggest that these hydrothermal systems were driven by natural thermal convection along anisotropic, subvertical faults connected in many cases at depth by permeable aquifers within favorable lithostratigraphic horizons. Those with minimal fluid $\delta$O shifts are restricted to high-permeability fault zones and relatively small-scale ($\sim$5 km), single-pass flow systems (e.g., Beowawe). Those with intermediate to large isotopic shifts (e.g., epithermal and Carlin-type Au) had larger-scale ($\sim$15 km) loop convection cells with a greater component of flow through marine sedimentary rocks at lower water/rock ratios and greater endowments of gold. Enthalpy calculations constrain the duration of Carlin-type gold systems to probably <200 k.y. Shallow heat flow gradients and fluid silica concentrations suggest that the duration of the modern Beowawe system is <5 k.y. However, fluid flow at Beowawe during the Quaternary must have been episodic with a net duration of $\sim$200 k.y. to account for the amount of silica in the sinter deposits.
In the Carlin trend, fluid circulation extended down into Paleozoic siliciclastic rocks, which afforded more mixing with isotopically enriched higher enthalpy fluids. Computed fission track ages along the Carlin trend included the convective effects, and ranged between 91.6 and 35.3 Ma. Older fission track ages occurred in zones of groundwater recharge, and the younger ages occurred in discharge areas. This is largely consistent with fission track ages reported in recent studies.
We found that either an amagmatic system with more permeable faults (10 m) or a magmatic system with less permeable faults (10 m) could account for the published isotopic and thermal data along the Carlin trend systems. Localized high heat flow beneath the Muleshoe fault was needed to match fluid inclusion temperatures at Mule Canyon. However, both magmatic and amagmatic scenarios require the existence of deep, permeable faults to bring hot fluids to the near surface.},

Today; the global average of subsurface runoff (groundwater, 13.320 km3) to surface runoff (43.790 km3) is about 30%. Globally, about⅔ of the total river discharge entering the sea today is from surface runoff, much of it originating as snowmelt, and⅓ is from groundwater, The present day data show similar proportions of surface runoff/subsurface runoff for different continents, 4:1 in Aus-tralia, 3:1 in Europe, Africa, and South America, and lower on other continents. The amount and seasonal distribution of surface runoff drives both mechanical erosion and terrigenous bio-logical activity. The amount and distribution of subsurface runoff is of importance for chemical erosion and subsurface dissolution. GENESIS (v.2.0) paleoclimate simulations of the Late Cretaceous, show a relation opposite to that of present, with subsurface runoff dominating over surface runoff both globally and region-ally. Globally, the simulations produce an annual mean value for subsurface runoff about 6 times higher than that of the surface runoff. Detailed examination of the data shows very large regional differences. The ratios of surface to subsurface runoff range from 1:2 (Sevier Highlands of west-ern North America) to 1:1200 (S-Asia). There are significant regional differences between the surface runoff and subsurface runoff, even at similar paleolatitudes. Not only does the total amount of water transported annually by these two mechanisms change dramatically, but their distribution during the course of a year is different from present. In addition to the effect of the different Cretaceous hydrology on rivers, low salinity, nutrient-rich groundwater discharge di-rectly into coastal waters could have had a significant impact on the local ecology along the margins of continents and islands. If atmospheric CO2 were also higher, as assumed in the pa-leoclimate simulation, the acidity of rainwater would also have been higher, ultimately affecting chemical erosion rates. These results were unexpected because the climate model uses a globally fixed vegetation model (after DORMAN &SELLERS, 1989 {\`{a}} “Type 6” broadleaf trees with groundcover {\`{a}} savanna) and a fixed soil module (sand: 51%; silt: 29%; clay: 20%). Therefore, in these simula-tions the climate system alone is responsible for the ratio and distribution between surface runoff and subsurface runoff. More realistic globally varying vegetation and soils would moderate the results, but would not reverse the general conclusion that rivers were very different in a green-house world.},

abstract = {The late Paleozoic to Tertiary stratigraphic record of much of the African plate reflects the effects of continental rifting and passive margin development. Several short-lived, but widespread and tectonically important, compressional or wrench-dominated events occurred, however, during the Permian to Recent evolution of Africa. We focus here on the best documented of these events, which occurred during the late Santonian. At that time, older sedimentary basins, mostly ENE-WSW trending, were folded and inverted, including some basins along the Tethyan margin from Morocco to the Syrian Arc and the intraplate Benue-southern Chad basins and the Lugh-Mandera basin. In Oman, ophiolites were obducted. Following the Santonian tectonism, an extensive phase of rifting occurred in Central and North Africa and northern Arabia, spanning from Campanian to Maastrichtian or Paleocene times. Rejuvenation or acceleration of subsidence occurred in several basins located along the Tethyan margin, along the Atlantic and Indian Ocean margins, as well as within the intraplate domain. Rifting was sometimes accompanied by magmatic activity, especially in offshore northern Libya and along the Indian Ocean margin. Compressional deformations rejuvenated or developed by latest Maastrichtian times along the Tethyan margin and locally within the intraplate domain. One of the most remarkable attributes of the Santonian tectonic event, which we consider representative of the major trans-African stress field changes, is the rapidity with which the change was reflected stratigraphically across North and Central Africa, and its short duration. The cause of the Santonian compressional event is directly linked to the change in poles of rotation for the opening of the Atlantic at 83-85 Ma, the end of the Cretaceous Normal Magnetic Quiet Zone. This was also synchronous with the obduction of ophiolites along the northeast margin of Arabia (Oman), the onset of separation between India and Madagascar with formation of the Mascarene oceanic basin, and the development of the European Alpine Chain. We interpret these phenomena as causally related aspects of a global tectonic event. The Santonian compressional event, as well as the Campanian-Maastrichtian rifting event and the end Cretaceous compressional event, illustrate the critical connection between intraplate tectonic histories and processes occurring at sometimes very distant plate boundaries.},

abstract = {The Feldbiss fault is the main active fault bounding to the southwest the Roer Valley Graben of NW Europe. In order to investigate the reasons of the discrepancy between its short- and long-term slip rate estimates, we have repeatedly surveyed a 2.3 km-long line by levelling at Sittard (The Netherlands) from April 2001 to December 2004. Simultaneously, three superposed aquifers were monitored on both sides of the fault. The across-fault differential groundwater variations are shown to be responsible for a seasonal 0.87 mm/m vertical motion of the fault, mainly through the effect of pore pressure changes in confined aquifers. After removal of this effect, I get a residual trend of - 0.60 [plus-or-minus sign] 0.11 mm/yr for the relative motion of the hangingwall. This trend was disturbed in the summer of 2002 by transient millimetre-level up and down motions temporally associated with the small Eschweiler earthquake that occurred on July 22, 2002 on the Feldbiss fault at a distance of 35 km from Sittard. I explain this as a creep event triggered by the passage of trapped seismic waves. The subsisting discrepancy between the long-term slip rate of 0.06 mm/yr and short-term rates of 1.5 mm/yr (from 1962 to 2001) and 0.6 mm/yr (from 2001 to 2004) is tentatively interpreted as resulting from the current occurrence of a decade-long episode of aseismic slip involving a large part of the fault plane. Occasionally associated with minor seismicity, this aseismic slip event could betray a thickening of the transitional region located below the upper crustal zone of stable sliding. It causes a total fault slip of 5-10 cm in a few tens of years, releasing smoothly all, or a great part of, the strain accumulated during the previous 1-2 ky of fault quiescence.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal deposits in extensional settings are common worldwide. These deposits are generally assumed to have formed from circulating fluids that mix with other fluids. However. the driving force for the circulation remains unclear in many cases. Here we present a model to explain the upward release of significant amounts of fluid from deeper crustal levels during extension, without the need to invoke fluid circulation cells. Compared to rocks, aqueous fluids are about ten times more compressible. Exhumation due to crustal thinning or denudation causes an instantaneous decrease in overburden pressure, without much change in fluid pressure in isolated pores. This implies that the relative fluid pressure increases during exhumation. and fluid needs to be expelled to maintain the original relative fluid pressure. Pore fluids at lithostatic pressure need to expel approximately 5% of their volume for every 100 MPa decompression of their host rock. We show that significant amounts of fluid (in the order of 10(-3) to 10(-4) km(3) fluid per km(2) crustal column) can be released this way during extensional events. Crustal heating may have the same effect, owing to the much larger thermal expansion of fluids compared to rocks. The proposed model was tested on the Schwarzwald hydrothermal ore district in SW Germany. Five different generations of mineralization, all formed during extensional events, could be distinguished based on mineralogy, geochemistry and age. We show that release of pore fluid that is driven by decompression and/or heating can supply sufficient amounts of fluid to account for the observed tonnages of gangue minerals in these hydrothermal deposits.

We have performed numerical simulations to test whether the deposit may have formed by forced fluid convection driven by progressive displacement on the Mount Isa fault zone, indicated by an ∼200 °C offset in metamorphic grade. Results indicate that uplift of ≥1 mm/yr induces regional fluid flow organizing into a stable, permeability-controlled circulation system. Far-field advection through the oxidized metabasalts is superimposed on smaller-scale convection in the metasedimentary rocks beneath the fault. As convection on the large scale gains momentum, the breccia progressively cools, consistent with mineralogic and fluid-inclusion evolution. For realistic uplift rates, the measured silica enrichment in the orebody (≥190 Mt SiO) is achieved in ∼1 m.y. Reduced and oxidized fluids mix at the proportions required for high-grade copper-iron sulfide precipitation, aided by rapid oscillations in the influx ratio of the two fluids into the most permeable and vigorously convecting orebody region.},

abstract = {Natural fault damage zones are composed of clusters of sub-seismic-scale faults surrounding larger faults. In siliclastic rocks these faults often form partial barriers to flow and significantly influence fluid flow. A three-dimensional statistical model of fault damage zone architecture, incorporating fault size, orientation and spatial characteristics observed in natural examples, is used with a two-dimensional discrete fault flow model to investigate fluid flow and up-scaling of permeability in fault damage zones with a permeability contrast between rock matrix and fault rock of four orders of magnitude. Models that incorporate realistic fault orientation distributions show mean bulk permeabilities that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the rock matrix. Incorporating spatial clustering of smaller-scale faults around large faults results in a higher variance of bulk permeability. The degree of `efficiency' of 50 by 50 m faulted regions (spanning the fault damage zone) is characterized by comparing their bulk permeability with that of the same sized two-dimensional region with a single spanning fault of constant thickness such that the two areas contain the same proportion of fault rock. Regions of size 50 by 50 m are found to be around 50% efficient in the direction perpendicular to the main fault and between 1 and 10% efficient parallel to the main fault. The efficiency of the fault network, thus defined, was found to be insensitive to the exponent of the power law length distribution. This concept of fault damage zone efficiency and the modelling results provide a method of estimating bulk rock permeability from measurements of the fault rock proportion from core or bore-hole logs. Bulk fault zone permeability consists of contributions from the fault damage zone and the fault slip zone on which the majority of the displacement takes place. Estimates of the contribution of the slip zone suggest that the fault damage zone contributes significantly to the bulk permeability of the entire fault zone when slip zone fault rocks have permeabilities no lower than around one order of magnitude less than that of deformation bands. However, even when the slip zone dominates the fault zone bulk permeability, the fault damage zone is likely to have an important influence on flow processes, such as fault seal.},

abstract = {With the beginning of the new century, the European EGS Project got into its decisive state by reaching the final reservoir depth of 5�km. The three boreholes, GPK2, GPK3 and GPK4 have been successfully targeted at their predefined reservoir positions. Improvement of the reservoir conditions by stimulation with a minimized seismic risk represents now a primary challenge to enable economic operation and future extension. In this context, the new HEX-S code has been developed to simulate the transient hydro-mechanical response of the rock matrix to massive hydraulic injections. The present paper describes the successful forecast of the pressure response and shearing locations for the GPK4 stimulation in September 2004. As basis for this predictive modeling, the reservoir model was derived from data analysis of the stimulation of GPK3 in May 2003. Stimulation flow rates up to 45�l/s at GPK4 and of >60�l/s at GPK3 have been applied, triggering several 10,000 of microseismic events. The transient numerical simulations with the HEX-S code match the main characteristics of both, the microseismic and the hydraulic behavior. Different model calculations demonstrate the capabilities of our new approach. It is noteworthy that the modeling became possible only due to the excellent data quality at the Soultz project. The results demonstrate that simulations based on solid physical ground can reveal the complex reservoir behavior during hydraulic stimulation. The use of HEX-S also provides perspectives for future developments such as design calculations that enable optimizing cost-intensive hydraulic stimulations before hand.},

This led to the development of a low-enthalpy geothermal plant close to Mons in the south, and to a demonstration project for a doublet system in north Belgium. Following the drop in oil prices in the mid-eighties, there was a corresponding decrease in the efforts to develop geothermal installations. The resources of the potential areas identified in a previous work were assessed.

abstract = {Two-dimensional, porous-medium, steady-state, coupled fluid- and heat-transport models are used to investigate some of the hydrogeological and thermal consequences of steeply dipping fault damage zones in a normally pressured basin setting. Simple geometries and conservative petrophysical properties can produce large-scale buoyancy-driven circulation, both outside and within the fault zone. An average (homogeneous) basin permeability of only 7 mD kh (horizontal permeability) and 0.07 mD kv (vertical permeability) results in a free convection cell of this type, with the upflow being localized by a 300 m wide fault zone (50 mD kh, 0.5 mD kv). Steady-state temperature anomalies as large as 15degreesC at the top of the fault zone can be produced by this arrangement. Smaller values of basin permeability still result in a similar circulation pattern, but at flow rates which produce temperature anomalies that are below detection levels. When the basin fill is more heterogeneous (layered), higher permeabilities can exist in some layers without large-scale convection occurring, because of the dampening effect of other, lower permeability units. In realistic geometrical configurations that are similar to the North Sea Central Graben, the fluid flow system is dominated by within-fault-zone convective circulation that produces local (\textless10 km half-wavelength), high amplitude (50degreesC) temperature anomalies which are comparable to the largest of those actually observed in the subsurface.},

abstract = {In continental rift zones, thermal anomalies and enhanced occurrence of mantle-derived fluids in groundwaters often coincide on a continental but rarely on the local scale. For areas of recent intraplate volcanism this suggests a time shift between the transport of mantle-derived volatiles and heat to the Earth's surface. As a particularly illustrative example, we studied the central European Rhine graben, which is distinguished by extensional tectonics, high seismicity, young, Upper Tertiary volcanism, abundant mineral water springs, and a heat flow anomaly. A combination of thermal, helium isotope, and major element data of mineral waters with numerical simulations of flow and heat transport leads to a profound understanding of crustal-scale transport processes and allows a clear distinction between diffusion and flow dominated regimes. The simulations show that for a crustal-scale system the transition between these two regimes occurs within one decade of permeability (10−16–10−17 m2). Flow is likely to be strongly controlled by fault systems both in the lower and upper crust. While thermal anomalies highlight fluid circulation within the upper brittle crust, mantle-derived volatiles provide information on transport phenomena from lower crustal sections. The thermal and hydro-chemical anomalies in the Upper Rhine graben are directly related to mass flow rates. Therefore lack of thermal anomalies around the Kaiserstuhl volcano suggests that mass flow rates must be very small, while positive thermal anomalies in the central part of the graben can directly be related to advection of fluids into basin sediments and to redistribution of heat within these sediments.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 2412013253 The brittle upper continental crust predominantly consists of granite and gneiss. Fractures form an interconnected network of water-conducting structures with an appreciable permeability also providing substantial fluid-saturated fracture porosity. The chemical composition of fluids in the fracture porosity of granite and gneiss changes with depth. Near the surface Ca2013Na2013HCO3 waters dominate. With increasing depth, water contains increasing amounts of alkalis and sulfate and grade into chloride-rich waters at greater depth. Total dissolved solids (TDS) of 105�mg�l22121 are common at 5-km depth in most basement rocks. All reported deep fluids from the upper crust contain predominantly NaCl and CaCl2. The brines vary from NaCl-rich in granites to CaCl2-rich in mafic reservoir rocks such as amphibolites and gabbros. In regions of the crust with strong topography, fluid flow is important and recharge water may have flushed the basement efficiently, thereby removing old brine components from the granites. Water samples from the new Gotthard Rail Base Tunnel of the Alps represent this type of basement fluid. Analyzed fluids from up to 2.5-km depth differ from basement fluids from areas with less-extreme topography in the following ways. Such waters have relatively low TDS of some 100�mg�l22121 and are typically of the Na2CO32013Na2SO4 type. pH tends to be high and varies from 9 to more than 10. Low Ca and ultra-low Mg of such waters result from efficient deposition of secondary Ca2013Mg minerals as coatings on fracture walls. Reduction of CO2 to CH4 provides the oxidation capacity for sulfate production from primary rock sulfides. The composition of fluids in fractured continental crust at depths below 120132�km depends strongly on the topography of the erosion surface. In crust with rugged alpine topography fluids at this depth are low-TDS high-pH waters that derive its composition from fluid2013rock interaction alone. In crust with low-to-moderate topography, basement fluids are normally near neutral high-TDS Na2013Ca chloride brines that derive the solutes not only from the rock matrix but also from external sources.},

abstract = {Abstract Vitrinite reflectance data from a petroleum exploration well in the northern Upper Rhinegraben show an unusual vertical maturity trend. Above and below a 500 m thick marl layer the vitrinite reflectance levels are consistent with modern, conductive, geothermal gradients. Between about 1000 and 1500 m depth, however, vitrinite reflectance levels are significantly elevated (about 0.6%Ro). This anomaly cannot be explained with one-dimensional conductive or conductive-convective heat transfer models, and thermal effects of sedimentation or igneous intrusion seem implausible for this geological setting. The thermal anomaly that formed this maturation anomaly must have been hydrothermal in origin, two-dimensional in nature, and persisted long enough to elevate the vitrinite reflectance values within this marl unit, yet it must have dissipated before the thermal perturbation would have altered the organic matter below and above the unit. In this study, we propose that the vitrinite reflectance anomalies were caused by a transient thermal inversion induced by episodic, lateral flow of hot (130-160oC) groundwater along conductive fractures and bedding planes. Heat flow constraints suggest that fluids must have moved rapidly up a vertical feeder fault from a depth of at least 3.6 km before migrating laterally. To test this hypothesis, we present a suite of simple, idealized mathematical models of groundwater flow, heat transfer, thermal degradation of kerogen and vitrinite systematics to explore the episodic flow that could have produced the observed thermal anomaly. In these simulations, a single, horizontal aquifer is sandwiched between two less permeable units: the total dimensions of the vertical section model are 4 km thick by 10 km long. The top of the aquifer coincides with the position of the observed thermal maturity anomaly in the Rhinegraben. Boundary conditions along the left edge of this aquifer were varied through time to allow for the migration of hot fluids out into the basin. Inflow temperature, horizontal velocity, duration and frequency of flow and thickness of the aquifer were varied. We found that a thermal maturity anomaly could only be produced by a rather restrictive set of hydrothermal conditions. It was possible to produce the observed vitrinite reflectance anomaly by a single hydrothermal flow event of 130oC fluid migrating laterally into the aquifer at a rate of 1 m a-1 for about 10 000 years. The anomaly is spatially confined to near the left edge of the basin, near the feeder fault. If the flow event lasted longer than 100 000 years, then the maturation anomaly disappeared as the lower confining unit approached steady-state thermal conditions. It is possible that such an event occurred about 5 million years ago in response to increases in fault permeability associated with far field Alpine tectonism.},

abstract = {The Jurassic-Cenozoic structural evolution of the eastern North Sea Basin is influenced by the central North Sea Dome, the Danish Megablock, the Tornquist Zone and the South Swedish Dome. The central North Sea Dome is a composite dome comprising the Triple Junction Dome, the Central Graben Dome and the Friesland Dome. The Danish Megablock, newly recognized here, is a first-order tectonic element between the Central Graben and the Tornquist Zone. In Jurassic-Cretaceous time it was tilted towards the east during uplift of the Central Graben Dome, whereas the movement was reversed during the Cenozoic post-rift subsidence. Contemporaneous with the westward tilting of the Danish Megablock, the South Swedish Dome was uplifted to the east. The uplift-subsidence reversal across the eastern North Sea Basin links the collapse of the Central Graben Dome and the tilt reversal of the Danish Megablock with the uplift of the South Swedish Dome. The uplift followed by subsidence probably involved mass flow in the asthenosphere to account for the observed balance between post-rift subsidence and marginal uplift. The model explains the uplift of both the South Swedish Dome and southern England as the result of Cenozoic post-rift subsidence of the Mesozoic Central Graben Dome.},

abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He and fission track age determinations of samples from a 20-km-long, near-horizontal tunnel in the Hochalm-Ankogel Dome (eastern Tauern Window, Austria) are presented in order to determine the role of (paleo)-topography in perturbing isotherms in the shallow crust. Apatite fission track ages (26–8 Ma) show no systematic correlation with distance along the tunnel or elevation. Two age components in the fission track data indicate cooling through ∼120�C at approximately 20 Ma and ∼80�C at approximately 6 Ma. Surface and tunnel (U-Th)/He ages (17–9 Ma and 13–5 Ma, respectively) are consistently younger than the equivalent fission track ages. (U-Th)/He ages vary systematically along the tunnel with older ages at the northern and southern tunnel portals and younger ages in the central section. Geological factors (faulting, lithology) appear to have had little effect on this age distribution. The (U-Th)/He age pattern is inconsistent with rock cooling underneath the present-day Hochalm-Ankogel Dome topography. The age minimum is interpreted to coincide with a paleotopographic maximum in the Hochalm-Ankogel Dome and suggests that the 40–60�C isotherms were warped sufficiently to affect apatite (U-Th)/He ages. The tunnel apatite (U-Th)/He ages match synthetic He ages derived from a two-dimensional numerical model of landscape evolution. Integrating the thermal model results with the data allows the relief development to be constrained and we calculate that the present-day Hochalm-Ankogel Dome topography was formed at 7 to 10 Ma.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We present a new approach, based on neural networks, to predict the thermal conductivity of sedimentary rocks from a set of geophysical well logs. This method is calibrated on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) data, which provide several thousands of conductivity measurements combined with five geophysical well logs (sonic, density, neutron porosity, resistivity and gamma ray). This data set is used to train multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and to find an empirical relationship between well logs (MLP inputs) and thermal conductivity (MLP output). Validation tests suggest that MLP provide better estimates of thermal conductivity (within 15 per cent confidence level) than classical linear models, and still give satisfying results with sets of only four well logs if neutron porosity is included. In two ODP sites (863B and 1109D), MLP's predictions are compared to conventional 'mixing' methods. Although this latter technique gives reliable results provided that rocks description is precise enough, the MLP is more straightforward, does not need any extra parameter and makes predictions in good agreement with the experimental trends. This method will be useful in the estimation of heat flow from data acquired in scientific and industrial boreholes.},

abstract = {The understanding of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of a clay barrier is needed for the prediction of its final in situ properties after the hydration and thermal transient in a radioactive waste repository. As part of the CEC 1990-1994 R&D programme on radioactive waste management and storage, the CEA (Fr), CIEMAT (Sp), ENRESA (Sp), SCK � CEN (B), UPC (Sp) and UWCC (UK) have carried out a joint project on unsaturated clay behaviour (Volckaert et al., 1996). The aim of the study is to analyse and model the behaviour of a clay-based engineered barrier during its hydration phase under real repository conditions. The hydro-mechanical and thermo-hydraulic models developed in this project have been coupled to describe stress/strain behaviour, moisture migration and heat transfer. A thermo-hydraulic model has also been coupled to a geochemical code to describe the migration and formation of chemical species. In this project, suction-controlled experiments have been performed on Boom clay (B), FoCa clay (Fr) and Almeria bentonite (Sp). The aim of these experiments is to test the validity of the interpretive model developed by Alonso and Gens (Alonso et al., 1990), and to build a database of unsaturated clay thermo-hydro-mechanical parameters. Such a database can then be used for validation exercises in which in situ experiments are simulated. The Boom clay is a moderately swelling clay of Rupellian age. It is studied at the SCK � CEN in Belgium as a potential host rock for a radioactive waste repository. In this paper, suction-controlled experiments carried out on Boom clay by SCK � CEN are described. SCK � CEN has performed experiments to measure the relation between suction, water content and temperature and the relation between suction, stress and deformation. The applied suction-control techniques and experimental setups are detailed. The results of these experiments are discussed in the perspective of the model of Alonso and Gens. The influence of temperature on water uptake was rather small. The measured swelling-collapse behaviour can be explained by the Alonso and Gens model.},

abstract = {Fluid flow simulation models of faulted reservoirs normally include faults as grid offset in combination with 2D transmissibility multipliers. This approach tends to oversimplify the way effects caused by the actual 3D architecture of fault zones are handled. By representing faults as 3D rock volumes in reservoir models, presently overlooked structural features may be included and potentially yield a more realistic description of structural heterogeneities. This paper investigates how a volumetric fault zone description, will affect fluid flow in simulation models.  An experimental 3D model grid including a single normal fault, defined as a volumetric grid, was constructed. Subsequently, the fault grid was populated with two conceptual fault deformation products - sand lenses and fault rock - using an object-based stochastic facies modelling technique. In order to evaluate the effect of varying petrophysical properties, fault rock permeability and sand lens permeability were varied deterministically between 0.01 mD and 1 mD and 50 mD and 500 mD, respectively. The impact of fault core architecture was investigated by deterministically varying sand lens fraction and sand lens connectivity. This yielded 24 model configurations, executed in 20 stochastic realizations each. Fluid flow simulation was performed on 480 model realizations.  Simulation results show that the most important parameters influencing fluid flow across the fault were fault rock matrix permeability, and whether or not the sand lenses were connected to the undeformed host rock. Sand lens permeability and sand lens fraction turned out to be less important for fluid flow than fault rock matrix permeability and sand lens connectivity.},

abstract = {Geological processes that create sedimentary basins or act during their formation can be simulated using the public domain computer code &lsquo;BASIN'. For a given set of geological initial and boundary conditions the sedimentary basin evolution is calculated in a forward modeling approach. The basin is represented in a two-dimensional vertical cross section with individual layers. The stratigraphic, tectonic, hydrodynamic and thermal evolution is calculated beginning at an initial state, and subsequent changes of basin geometry are calculated from sedimentation rates, compaction and pore fluid mobilization, isostatic compensation, fault movement and subsidence. The sedimentologic, hydraulic and thermal parameters are stored at discrete time steps allowing the temporal evolution of the basin to be analyzed. A maximum flexibility in terms of geological conditions is achieved by using individual program modules representing geological processes which can be switched on and off depending on the data available for a specific simulation experiment. The code incorporates a module for clastic and carbonate sedimentation, taking into account the impact of clastic sediment supply on carbonate production. A maximum of four different sediment types, which may be mixed during sedimentation, can be defined. Compaction and fluid flow are coupled through the consolidation equation and the nonlinear form of the equation of state for porosity, allowing nonequilibrium compaction and overpressuring to be calculated. Instead of empirical porosity-effective stress equations, a physically consistent consolidation model is applied which incorporates a porosity dependent sediment compressibility. Transient solute transport and heat flow are calculated as well, applying calculated fluid flow rates from the hydraulic model. As a measure for hydrocarbon generation, the Time-Temperature Index (TTI) is calculated. Three postprocessing programs are available to provide graphic output in PostScript format: BASINVIEW is used to display the distribution of parameters in the simulated cross-section of the basin for defined time steps. It is used in conjunction with the Ghostview software, which is freeware and available on most computer systems. AIBASIN provides PostScript output for Adobe Illustrator(R), taking advantage of the layer-concept which facilitates further graphic manipulation. BASELINE is used to display parameter distribution at a defined well or to visualize the temporal evolution of individual elements located in the simulated sedimentary basin. The modular structure of the BASIN code allows additional processes to be included. A module to simulate reactive transport and diagenetic reactions is planned for future versions. The program has been applied to existing sedimentary basins, and it has also shown a high potential for classroom instruction, giving the possibility to create hypothetical basins and to interpret basin evolution in terms of sequence stratigraphy or petroleum potential.},

Fracture geometry and properties are simulated with Monte Carlo simulation. The heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity is simulated by direct sequential co-simulation using measurements of hydraulic conductivity and four types of secondary variables. The hydraulic conductivity and fracture simulations are used as input for a transport model. Radionuclide fluxes computed with this heterogeneous model are compared with fluxes obtained with a homogeneous model. The output fluxes of the heterogeneous model differ at most 8% from the homogeneous model.

abstract = {To date, research on neotectonics and related continental topography development has mostly focused on active plate boundaries characterized by generally high deformation rates. The intraplate sedimentary basins and rifts of the Northern Alpine foreland are associated with a much higher level of neotectonic activity than hitherto assumed. Seismicity and stress indicator data, combined with geodetic and geomorphologic observations, demonstrate that Europe's intraplate lithosphere is being actively deformed. This has major implications for the assessment of its natural hazards and environmental degradation. The lithosphere of the Northern Alpine foreland has undergone a polyphase evolution with an intense interplay between upper mantle thermal perturbations and stress-induced intraplate deformation that points to the importance of lithospheric folding of the thermally weakened lithosphere. In this paper, we address relationships between deeper lithospheric processes, neotectonics and surface processes in the Northern Alpine foreland with special emphasis on tectonically induced topography. The objectives are to quantify the effects of ongoing Alpine collision and Atlantic ridge-push on the intraplate deformation in Europe and its impact on topography evolution and related natural hazards.This paper reviews the four-dimensional topographic evolution of the European lithosphere through a multi-disciplinary approach linking geology, geophysics and geotechnology. Until now, research on neotectonics and related topography development of intraplate regions has received little attention. Our study examines a number of selected natural laboratories in continental Europe. From orogen through platform to continental margin, these natural laboratories include the Carpathians-Pannonian system, the Northwest European Platform, Iberia and the Atlantic continental margin.We focus on lithosphere memory and neotectonics with special attention to the thermo-mechanical structure of the lithosphere, mechanisms of large-scale intraplate deformation, Late-Neogene anomalies in subsidence and uplift, and links with surface processes and topography evolution.},

abstract = {Thermally, the lithosphere may be defined as that outer portion of the earth in which heat is transferred primarily by conduction. It generally includes the crust and part of the mantle. The thermal regime of continental lithosphere is determined by many factors including heat flow from the asthenosphere, the vertical and lateral variation of both thermal conductivity and radiogenic heat production, tectonic history, and such superficial processes as climatic history and the shallow hydrothermal regime. From studies of the global heat flow data set, two generalizations regarding continental lithosphere have arisen, namely that: 1) there is a negative correlation between heat flow and tectonic age of continental lithosphere; and 2) the thermal evolution of continental lithosphere is similar to that of ocean basins with the result that the "stable geotherm" is similar in both environments. When continental heat-flow data are studied from a regional rather than a global point of view, considerable doubt arises as to the general applicability of either statement. R. U. M. Rao and his associates have demonstrated that while Precambrian terranes do have demonstrably lower heat flows than, say, Tertiary terranes, the data are not normally distributed and it is not possible to establish a negative correlation between heat flow and age in any rigorous statistical way. The scatter in the relation may be explained in terms of the variations in the duration, intensity and even the sign of continental thermotectonic events in contrast to the simple situation (creation of new oceanic lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges) which prevails in the oceans. The scatter also is partially attributable to the large and laterally variable radiogenic component of heat flow on continents. For a province for which a heat flow-heat production relation has been established, much of the scatter in surface heat flow due to crustal radiogenic heat production versus age is eliminated by determining reduced heat flow (surface heat flow minus radiogenic component) as a function of tectonic age, but much scatter remains, and it is still not possible to establish a heat flux-age relation in a rigorous way. Primarily because of the spatial variability in radiogenic heat production, no single geotherm can be used to characterize the thermal regime of a stable continental terrane. Thus, while some sites on stable continental blocks may have a geotherm fortuitously similar to that for old ocean basins, there is no reason to expect that this will be true generally, and many stable continental terranes will be characterized by geotherms markedly different from the geotherm for old ocean basins.},

abstract = {Annealing rates for fission tracks in apatite vary markedly as a complex function of composition, based on an experimental study of 15 well-characterized, compositionally diverse apatites. Extensive annealing data were obtained in 69 experiments (durations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 h at temperatures from 75 to 400 °C) on each of four apatites, three with near end-member occupancy of the halogen site by F, Cl, and OH, plus the well-known apatite from Durango, Mexico. These results were supplemented by less-comprehensive annealing data from 12 experiments over the same range of time and temperature on each of the remaining 11 apatites. Measurements of initial fission-track length, a parameter of considerable importance to the derivation of time-temperature paths from fission-track data, reveal substantial variations from one apatite to another; initial lengths are best predicted from etch figures. Interlaboratory comparisons of data on annealing kinetics highlight discrepancies that appear to result largely from differences in the precision and accuracy of experimental temperatures. None of the factors previously proposed as the dominant compositional controls on annealing rates can account completely for annealing behavior over the full range of compositions studied. Nevertheless, relative rates of annealing among all apatites are highly systematic, which allows this data set to be used in its entirety to constrain multikinetic annealing models that predict fission-track lengths as a function of time and temperature.},

abstract = {We performed a detailed analysis of the thermal state of the Cenozoic Roer Valley Graben, the north2013western branch of the European Cenozoic Rift System, based on a new set of temperature data. We developed a numerical technique for correcting bottom hole temperatures, including an evaluation of the uncertainty of thermal parameters. Comparison with drill stem test temperatures indicated that the uncertainty in corrected bottom hole temperatures using a two-component numerical model is approximately � 4��C, which is much more accurate than the up to 15��C errors encountered in often-used line-source or Horner correction methods. The subsurface temperatures and the derived regional heat flow estimates of 53 � 6 to 63 � 6�mW�m22122 show no significant difference between the central rift and the adjacent structural highs. The absence of an elevated heat flow is attributed to the low amount of lithospheric thinning during the Cenozoic rifting phase (03B2=1.0620131.15). A local thermal anomaly exceeding +10��C was found in five wells in the north2013western part of the rift basin at depths of 100020131500�m, and is most likely caused by the upward flow of fluids along faults, whereas lower temperatures in the upper 1500�m in the southern part of the rift basin could indicate cooling by topography-driven groundwater flow. Conflicting ideas exist on the active or passive rifting mechanisms responsible for the formation of the different rift basins of European Cenozoic Rift System. The low spatial variation in heat flow found in this study suggests that the mechanism responsible for forming the Roer Valley Graben is passive rifting.},

abstract = {The Merksplas-Beerse well (North Belgium) is a low-enthalpy geothermal production well targeting the Dinantian karstic limestones to a total depth of 1761 m. The presence of methane gas in these limestones generated a particular interest in this well. This paper describes the geological profile of this well and the Dinantian reservoir. The Namurian-Visean boundary at 1630 m is determined by the base of the dipmeter draping pattern in the radioactive Chokier shales (base of the Namurian) on top of the karstified Dinantian limestone. The stratigraphic composition of the transitional interval from Dinantian to Silesian correlates closely to the nearby Turnhout well. The two fractured intervals at 1630-1656 and 1739-1747 m respectively were identified in the Dinantian limestones. They are associated with siliciclastic sections in between pure limestones. The reservoir water is a sodium chloride brine of about 74°C and at a pressure below the hydrostatic. The water is slightly radioactive because of the contact with the Chokier hot shales. A carbon dioxide gas with methane and nitrogen admixture is dissolved in the water. The gas liquid ratio at standard conditions is about one and the bubble point is around 200-400 psi at reservoir temperature. A long duration pumping test shows a high fracture permeability and a productivity index of 5.4 m3/h/bar with a productivity to injectivity ratio of 1.45.},

abstract = {Fission-track (FT) data from the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic Newark rift basin indicate long-lived convective downwelling along the border fault. Zircons and apatites from the basin and the surrounding basement yield FT ages averaging [$\sim$]180 Ma and [$\sim$]140-150 Ma, respectively (i.e., younger than the age of the host rocks). However, along the border fault of the basin, zircon ages exceed 300 Ma and apatite ages are as high as 214 Ma (i.e., older than the depositional ages). The proximity of samples heated to >220 {+/-}40 {degrees}C, which reset zircons, and those never heated above 120 {+/-}20 {degrees}C across a zone 5-10 km wide indicates an anomalous zone of low temperatures that resulted from the downwelling of water at the border faults. The FT results and other indicators of Hydrothermal flow attest to the circulation of relatively high temperature (100-250 {degrees}C) fluids in a pervasive Jurassic hydrothermal convection system. The fluid-convection downwelling along the border fault of the basin may be the consequence of the high topography that bordered the Newark basin in Triassic and Jurassic time. Hydrothermal flow ended by the time coastal-plain sediments covered the basin. Hydrothermal fluids circulating in extensional environments are potentially very important in modifying the temperature structure of the basins and crust.},

abstract = {Abstract The western Lower Saxony Basin is characterized by magnetic and gravity anomalies and an unusually strong coalification of surface-near sedimentary rocks, indicating that high temperatures were reached in the past. The temperature history of the basin has been disputed for many years leading basically to two different hypotheses: one proposes igneous intrusion during Mid Cretaceous time, causing the high maturity in this area, whereas the other theory explained the coalification as a result of deep burial during late Jurassic and early Cretaceous times. Petrographical data are summarized which show the maturity distribution within the basin, reflecting maximum palaeotemperature conditions. This maturity distribution is visualized along three cross sections of up to 50 km length, as well as the palaeotemperature distribution for six time steps. Furthermore, geochemical data on petroleum source rocks are presented which indicate early mature/immature type I/II kerogen in Wealden and Posidonia Shales and mature/overmature type III kerogen in the coal-bearing Upper Carboniferous. Fluid inclusion compositions in quartz crystals are highly variable ranging from liquid to gaseous, and gas compositions are also variable. These data were interpreted in the context of burial history. This study provides new data and numerical models with the intention to clarify the cause of the high coalification in the basin. 2D structural and basin modelling along three cross sections, combined with new fluid inclusion measurements and results of previous coalification studies, 1D modelling, and fission track dating demonstrate high heat flow during the Late Jurassic extension stage followed by a deep burial of the basin during the Early Cretaceous, associated with only moderate heat flows. The presence of an igneous intrusion of Cretaceous age is not supported. Furthermore, timing of hydrocarbon generation from the three major source rocks is discussed.},

We show here that when data relative to fractures are collected along a line such as a road or a well, estimations can be given to the major geometrical properties of the corresponding fracture networks, such as the volumetric density of fractures, their percolation character and their macroscopic permeability. All these formulae are analytical and can be split into two parts; the first one can be derived from the measured data, while the second one requires some assumption on the lateral extension of the fractures and on their permeability. All these techniques are applied to fractures located in the Baget watershed. They are also validated on a granite block whose structure is fully known. Extensions are proposed for networks with variable permeabilities and polydisperse fractures.},

The objective of this research is to assess the chemical alteration of freshwater and freshwater–seawater mixtures advecting through coastal permeable sands, and the influence of the submarine discharge of these fluids (SGD) on the chemistry of coastal waters. Here we focus on dissolved iron in this system and use radium isotopic tracers to quantify SGD and cross-shelf fluxes. Iron concentrations in groundwaters vary between 0.6 and 180 $\mu$M. The influence of the submarine discharge of these fluids into the surf zone produces dissolved Fe concentrations as high as several micromolar in coastal surface waters. The offshore gradient of dissolved Fe, coupled with results for Ra isotopes, is used to quantify the SGD flux of dissolved Fe from this coastline. We estimate the SGD flux to be 2×106 mol day−1 and the cross-shelf flux to be 3.2×105 mol day−1. This latter flux is equal to about 10% of the soluble atmospheric Fe flux to the entire South Atlantic Ocean. We speculate on the importance of this previously unrecognized iron input to regional ocean production and on the potential significance of this source to understanding variations in glacial–interglacial ocean production.},

The observed 20‰ trend of decreasing d 18 O over about a 5000-to-7000-year period following each earthquake is consistent with a fault-controlled groundwater flow system that, following initial discharge of deep and hot groundwater, contains increasing amounts of cool meteoric water through time. Model simulations of this hydro-thermal system can only match trends in the isotope data if we include a thousand-fold increase in fault perme-ability (from <10 {\`{A}}14 m 2 to >10 {\`{A}}11 m 2) following each earthquake. However, the timescale for onset of thermal convection implied by an overturned temperature profile in a geothermal well 300 m from the Malpais fault is much shorter: 200–1000 years.

We use a refined version of the 3D Monte Carlo diffusion code of Gautheron and Tassan-Got (2010) to simulate the interplay between ejection and diffusion with or without zonation, ejection and abrasion for a suite of thermal histories. We examine the phenomenon of over-correction produced by the alpha ejection correction parameter (F T or F ZAC for homogeneous or heterogeneous eU repartition) by comparing the raw (measured) and F T- or F ZAC-corrected ages for a number of scenarios to the ejection-free age (A EF), which we define as the age that would be obtained if alpha ejection had not occurred, or equivalently if the stopping distance was zero. We show that the use of F T- or F ZAC-corrected ages generally reproduces the ejection-free age to within typical (U-Th)/He uncertainties (±8%), even for zoned apatites. We then quantify the effect of alpha implantation on (U-Th)/He ages, showing that implantation from a single external source with modest relative U or Th enrichment can generate as much as 50% excess He. For more extreme cases where an apatite is surrounded by multiple external sources the measured age can be >300% of that determined from an isolated crystal. While abrasion of the outer 20-25$\mu$m can significantly reduce the age dispersion for rapidly cooled samples, slowly cooled samples can still retain 10-30% excess He. The removal of the rim of the crystal reduces the thermal information from very low temperatures (<40°C), and introduces additional technical complications and biases, and should therefore be used with caution. Overall we demonstrate that although zonation and implantation may not be routinely determined, we now have the 3D modeling capability to fully investigate and constrain the causes of age dispersion within a sample, leading to significant improvement in our ability to interpret (U-Th)/He data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {None of the standard porosity-velocity models (e.g. the time-average equation, Raymer's equations) is satisfactory for interpreting well-logging data over a broad depth range. Clays in the section are the usual source of the difficulty through the bias and scatter that they introduce into the relationship between porosity and P-wave transit time. Because clays are composed of fine sheet-like particles, they normally form pores with much smaller aspect ratios than those associated with sand grains. This difference in pore geometry provides the key to obtaining more consistent resistivity and sonic log interpretations. A velocity model for Clay2013sand mixtures has been developed in terms of the Kuster and Toks{\"{o}}z, effective medium and Gassmann theories. In this model, the total pore space is assumed to consist of two parts: (1) pores associated with sand grains and (2) pores associated with clays (including bound water). The essential feature of the model is the assumption that the geometry of pores associated with sand grains is significantly different from that associated with clays. Because of this, porosity in shales affects elastic compliance differently from porosity in sand-Stones. The predictive power of the model is demonstrated by the agreement between its predictions and laboratory measurements and by its ability to predict sonic logs from other logs over large depth intervals where formations vary from unconsolidated to consolidated sandstones and shales.},

As a result, a three-dimensional finite-difference groundwater flow model (equivalent porous media) may not apply as the dual porosity nature of karst features and the effects of turbulent flow cannot be directly simulated. Statistical analysis of karst hydrographs of the Trifilia aquifer in Greece showed the existence of a slightly karstified mass with high primary porosity that regulates the flow. An equivalent porous media model was developed to simulate the Trifilia karst aquifer using MODFLOW. Steady state and transient state calibration gave encouraging results for the equivalent porous media approach, which does not consider pipe flow or turbulence. Detailed hydrogeological research conducted in the area helped define the aquifer hydraulic conductivity zones and extent; and flux to/from the aquifer. Only hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were adjusted during calibration, as the flux to/from the system was considered known and applied as boundary conditions. Small mean absolute and RMS piezometric head error of the model under both steady and transient state conditions were achieved.},

abstract = {Fifty years ago a classic paper by W. W. Rubey [(1951) Geol. Soc. Am. Bull. 62, 1111-1148] examined various hypotheses regarding the origin of sea water and concluded that the most likely hypothesis was volcanic outgassing, a view that was generally accepted by earth scientists for the next several decades. More recent work suggests that the rate of subduction of water is much larger than the volcanic outgassing rate, lending support to hypotheses that either ocean volume has decreased with time, or that the imbalance is offset by continuous replenishment of water by cometary impacts. These alternatives are required in the absence of additional mechanisms for the return of water from subducting lithosphere to the Earth's surface. Our recent work on crustal permeability suggests a large capacity for water upflow through tectonically active continental crust, resulting in a heretofore unrecognized degassing pathway that can accommodate the water subduction rate. Escape of recycled water via delivery from the mantle through zones of active metamorphism eliminates the mass-balance argument for the loss of ocean volume or extraterrestrial sources.},

abstract = {Three major fracture types in the Dinantian of the Namur syncline at the northern margin of the Variscan foreland in southern Belgium, have been investigated by fluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis. The oldest and volumetrically most important fracture type is characterized by conjugated and sigmoidal en-echelon calcite veins which formed during the Variscan folding. These veins, and the surrounding limestones, have both a similar dull brown-orange luminescence and stable isotopic composition ($\delta$18O = −11. to −8‰ PDB and $\delta$13C = 0. to + 3‰ PDB). This indicates precipitation of the calcite cement from a fluid buffered by the rock. In the area studied, only a limited amount of fluids was expelled through the Dinantian during the main phase of Variscan compressional tectonism. Fractures filled with ferroan calcites cross-cut the Variscan .folds. Fluid inclusion and stable isotopic evidence indicates that the calcites precipitated at 40°–60°C from a saline fluid (9.2 to 23.2 eq. wt% NaCl) with an estimated $\delta$18O composition between −2.0‰ and −0.6. SMOW. The most likely origin of these high-salinity fluids with a relatively low-oxygen isotopic composition is a gravity-driven meteoric water which underwent an intense water-rock interaction. The topographic relief created by the Variscan tectonism could have allowed groundwater to penetrate into the deeper subsurface and to migrate towards the margin of the foreland basin. Non-ferroan, fracture-filling calcites formed later during the Mesozoic or Tertiary. Low-salinity meteoric waters and high-salinity CaCl2---NaCl brines with a temperature around 50°C migrated through this fracture system. Along these fractures, meteoric water migrated down into the subsurface and the brines could have flowed upward from the basement.},

abstract = {Geological processes that create sedimentary basins or act during their formation can be simulated using the public domain computer code &lsquo;BASIN'. For a given set of geological initial and boundary conditions the sedimentary basin evolution is calculated in a forward modeling approach. The basin is represented in a two-dimensional vertical cross section with individual layers. The stratigraphic, tectonic, hydrodynamic and thermal evolution is calculated beginning at an initial state, and subsequent changes of basin geometry are calculated from sedimentation rates, compaction and pore fluid mobilization, isostatic compensation, fault movement and subsidence. The sedimentologic, hydraulic and thermal parameters are stored at discrete time steps allowing the temporal evolution of the basin to be analyzed. A maximum flexibility in terms of geological conditions is achieved by using individual program modules representing geological processes which can be switched on and off depending on the data available for a specific simulation experiment. The code incorporates a module for clastic and carbonate sedimentation, taking into account the impact of clastic sediment supply on carbonate production. A maximum of four different sediment types, which may be mixed during sedimentation, can be defined. Compaction and fluid flow are coupled through the consolidation equation and the nonlinear form of the equation of state for porosity, allowing nonequilibrium compaction and overpressuring to be calculated. Instead of empirical porosity-effective stress equations, a physically consistent consolidation model is applied which incorporates a porosity dependent sediment compressibility. Transient solute transport and heat flow are calculated as well, applying calculated fluid flow rates from the hydraulic model. As a measure for hydrocarbon generation, the Time-Temperature Index (TTI) is calculated. Three postprocessing programs are available to provide graphic output in PostScript format: BASINVIEW is used to display the distribution of parameters in the simulated cross-section of the basin for defined time steps. It is used in conjunction with the Ghostview software, which is freeware and available on most computer systems. AIBASIN provides PostScript output for Adobe Illustrator(R), taking advantage of the layer-concept which facilitates further graphic manipulation. BASELINE is used to display parameter distribution at a defined well or to visualize the temporal evolution of individual elements located in the simulated sedimentary basin. The modular structure of the BASIN code allows additional processes to be included. A module to simulate reactive transport and diagenetic reactions is planned for future versions. The program has been applied to existing sedimentary basins, and it has also shown a high potential for classroom instruction, giving the possibility to create hypothetical basins and to interpret basin evolution in terms of sequence stratigraphy or petroleum potential.},

abstract = {Readily available laboratory, in situ, and inferred values of permeability, k, of crystalline and argillaceous rocks have been compared. For crystalline rocks, in situ k ranged from about 1 [mu]d (10-14 cm2) to 100 md; for argillaceous rocks it was about 0.01 to 1 [mu]d. No systematic decrease of k with depth was evident; over some interval at nearly every well, k was 1 to 100 md; these highly conductive intervals were as deep as 2-3 km. In situ permeability has been inferred from earthquake precursors, anomalous pore pressure, leakage from aquifers or other large-scale phenomena. Where crystalline rocks are involved, k was about 0.1 to 10 md, and thus about the same as the more permeable zones in wells; this is close to the permeability of many sandstones and is about 103 times greater than laboratory,measurements for intact crystalline rocks. For argillaceous rocks, laboratory, in situ, and inferred values all agreed within about a factor of 10. Laboratory study of artificial fractures suggest that in situ values for crystalline rocks are high because of natural fractures; fractures may be sealed or absent in shale.Based on observed variation in wells, k at particular sites in crystalline rock is not predictable within a factor of 105. For crystalline rocks, laboratory values provide little more than the minimum in situ k; for argillaceous rocks they may provide a good estimate of in situ k. Because of the great sensitivity of k to the effective stress, measurement or estimation of k must be tailored to the particular stress state of the application.If, as tentatively suggested by in situ and inferred values of k, average crustal k is about 10 md, pore pressure much greater than hydrostatic seems ruled out in terrains of outcropping crystalline rocks. Apart from hot pluton environments, anomalously high pore pressures seem to require everywhere a thick blanket of clay-rich rocks, as originally suggested for sedimentary basins.},

These types include acid (0.98% at global scale) and basic (5.75%) volcanics, acid (7.23%) and basic (0.20%) plutonics, Precambrian basement (11.52%) and metamorphic rocks (4.07%), consolidated siliciclastic rocks (16.28%), mixed sedimentary (7.75%), carbonates (10.40%), semi- to un-consolidated sedimentary rocks (10.05%), alluvial deposits (15.48%), loess (2.62%), dunes (1.54%) and evaporites (0.12%). Where sediments, volcanics and metamorphosed rocks are too intimately mixed, a complex lithology (5.45%) class is added. Average composition is then tabulated for continents, ocean drainage basins, relief types (n = 7), 10� latitudinal bands, geological periods (n = 7), and exorheic versus endorheic domain and for formerly glaciated regions. Surficial lithology is highly heterogeneous and major differences are noted in any of these ensembles.

abstract = {Using a combination of fluid inclusion and mineralogical techniques, chemical data have been obtained that help characterise the hydrogeochemistry of palaeogroundwaters in the onshore section of the Eastern Irish Sea Basin, northwest England. The study area, Sellafield, provided an excellent suite of fracture-controlled carbonate cements deposited from shallow to deeply circulating late Triassic to Recent groundwaters. Methodologies developed for the analysis of hydrothermal fluid inclusions were extended to encompass a wide range of low temperature aqueous inclusions. These included single inclusion chemical analysis by UV laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry (Na, K, Mg, Sr, Li, Mn, Fe) and high precision salinity measurements (+/-1000 ppm TDS) by microthermometric analysis. Closely integrated with these measurements were calcite morphology and cathodoluminescence (CL) studies that were undertaken to provide a relative chronology `stratigraphy' of carbonate cementation and information on redox conditions and salinity with depth. The results demonstrate a clear distinction between the chemistry of the late Triassic groundwaters and the present day, deep, saline groundwaters. Though both have TDS values \textgreater100,000 ppm, the former are Ca-Na-Cl brines with Na/Ca wt ratios of 2:1, whilst the latter are Na-Cl brines with Na/Ca wt. ratios greater than 20. For younger generations of calcite, attributable to deposition from groundwater during the Quaternary, TDS values are \textless100,000 ppm with salinities typically less than 20,000 ppm. Laser ablation analyses of aqueous inclusions in these younger calcites for Na, Sr and Mg plot exactly within the fields defined by the present day saline to brackish groundwaters, and display similar trends. CL patterns for the Quaternary calcites are primarily a function of trace element impurities (Fe and Mn), but all show a marked contrast at the fresh water-saline water transition. This contrast is also reflected in the morphology of the calcite crystals; from c-axis shortened `nailhead' forms in the fresh groundwater zone to c-axis elongated `scalenohedra' forms in the deeper saline zones. Implications for the evolution of the palaeogroundwaters in response to Tertiary uplift with respect to present day groundwater regimes are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The Roermond earthquake of 1992 April 13 is one of the most important seismic events for assessing potentially destructive strong ground-motion parameters in central Europe. Owing to the lack of unclipped near-source records, however, the source depth as well as the high-frequency signal contents are only known to within large uncertainties. Using a stochastic simulation technique, site-dependent synthetic acceleration seismograms and simulated Wood-Anderson records for the Roermond Earthquake were calculated for the epicentral region and a site in 60 km distance. For the distant site, three different damping models were modelled while for the epicentral region, a tertiary and quaternary coverage of 1500 m was assumed. Both constant- and frequency-dependent Q were considered. the resulting simulations were tested for their consistency with (a) epicentral acceleration between 1.0 and 2.0m sec22122 as indicated by the low observed epicentral intensities of slightly above VII, (b) the observed peak ground accelerations at a distance of 50-60 km which are reported to be 0.3 � 0.1 m sec22122, and (c) the observed Wood-Anderson magnitude of MWA2248 5.9�0.2. While the stochastic simulation does not result in a single unique model, it allows the comparison of certain models (including their uncertainties) in terms of their consistency with the observations. the most pronounced result shows that of the three different source depths (13, 21 and 25 km) which were investigated, the shallow source is by a wide margin the least consistent with the observations, independent of the remaining model assumptions. On the other hand, peak accelerations of 0.3 � 0.1 m sec22122 in 50-60km distance can be explained by reasonable combinations of seismic moments and corner frequencies for all the site-damping models. While under the constant-Q assumption, the most consistent M0/fc combinations show a clear trade-off between fc and M0 for M02248 (5-10) � 1016 Nm, this trade-off is strongly reduced if Q is assumed frequency dependent as Q=Q0�f03B1. For an average seismic moment of M0= 7.5 � 1016 Nm, a corner frequency of 1.020131.25 Hz provides the maximum joint consistency scores independent of the other model assumptions.},

abstract = {The understanding of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of a clay barrier is needed for the prediction of its final in situ properties after the hydration and thermal transient in a radioactive waste repository. As part of the CEC 1990-1994 R&D programme on radioactive waste management and storage, the CEA (Fr), CIEMAT (Sp), ENRESA (Sp), SCK � CEN (B), UPC (Sp) and UWCC (UK) have carried out a joint project on unsaturated clay behaviour (Volckaert et al., 1996). The aim of the study is to analyse and model the behaviour of a clay-based engineered barrier during its hydration phase under real repository conditions. The hydro-mechanical and thermo-hydraulic models developed in this project have been coupled to describe stress/strain behaviour, moisture migration and heat transfer. A thermo-hydraulic model has also been coupled to a geochemical code to describe the migration and formation of chemical species. In this project, suction-controlled experiments have been performed on Boom clay (B), FoCa clay (Fr) and Almeria bentonite (Sp). The aim of these experiments is to test the validity of the interpretive model developed by Alonso and Gens (Alonso et al., 1990), and to build a database of unsaturated clay thermo-hydro-mechanical parameters. Such a database can then be used for validation exercises in which in situ experiments are simulated. The Boom clay is a moderately swelling clay of Rupellian age. It is studied at the SCK � CEN in Belgium as a potential host rock for a radioactive waste repository. In this paper, suction-controlled experiments carried out on Boom clay by SCK � CEN are described. SCK � CEN has performed experiments to measure the relation between suction, water content and temperature and the relation between suction, stress and deformation. The applied suction-control techniques and experimental setups are detailed. The results of these experiments are discussed in the perspective of the model of Alonso and Gens. The influence of temperature on water uptake was rather small. The measured swelling-collapse behaviour can be explained by the Alonso and Gens model.},

This model now has been modified to predict sandstone porosity through time in order to provide a better way to model sandstone porosity for 1-D basin modeling. The Modified Scherer Model (MSM) has many advantages over the depth-dependent Sclater-Christie (Athy) and Falvey-Middleton equations used for calculating porosity in 1-D modeling, because it predicts major differences resulting from age, sedimentation rate, sandstone composition, and pressure that are not considered in depth-dependent models. The only additional information required by the MSM is quartz content and Trask sorting coefficient. If these are not known, they may be estimated with reasonable confidence. The Modified Scherer Method could be added easily to existing software packages for 1-D modeling. It also may prove useful for making preliminary estimates of reservoir porosity (including timing of porosity loss), especially in early stages of exploration.},

abstract = {Abstract We have investigated whether low temperature thermochronological datasets can be used to constrain the rate of surface evolution during the post-orogenic phase of a mountain belt. We use a numerical method to solve the heat transport equation in the Earth's crust, including the effects of a changing, finite-amplitude topography and the resulting flexural isostatic rebound. We demonstrate that accurate estimates of the amount of relief loss can be obtained by applying a recently developed spectral method that is based on estimates of the relationship between age and surface elevation as a function of topographic wavelength. We also show that the rate at which topography decays with time following cessation of tectonic activity can be constrained from estimates of exhumation rate derived from the slope of age–elevation profiles collected across short wavelength topography. Using the Neighbourhood Algorithm to perform a thorough search through parameter space, we are able to find a tectonomorphic scenario that predicts age distributions compatible with a thermochronological dataset collected in the Dabie Shan of eastern China by Reiners et al. (American Journal of Science 2003, vol. 303, pp. 489–518). We demonstrate that, in the Dabie Shan, the mean topographic relief has decreased by a factor of 2{\textperiodcentered}5 to 4{\textperiodcentered}5 during the last 60–80 Ma, while the mountain belt experienced a mean exhumation rate of 0{\textperiodcentered}01 to 0{\textperiodcentered}04 km Ma−1. We confirm the conclusions of Reiners et al. that there is no need to invoke a discrete Cenozoic tectonic event to explain the observed age distribution. The thermochronological dataset can also be used to put constraints on the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere underlying the orogen (10 to 30 km). There is, however, a trade-off between elastic thickness, mean exhumation rate and amount of topographic relief loss. The most likely scenario also predicts that the topography has decreased at a constant rate since the end of orogenic activity about 100 Ma ago.

Uplifted Variscan basement of the Black Forest and the Vosges forms the flanks of the southern part of the graben. Apatite and zircon fission-track (FT) analyses indicate a complex low-temperature thermal history of the basement that was deciphered by inverse modelling of FT parameters. The models were tested against the observed data and independent geological constraints. The zircon FT ages of 28 outcrop samples taken along an E–W trending transect across the Black Forest and the Vosges range from 136 to 312 Ma, the apatite FT ages from 20 to 83 Ma. The frequency distributions of confined track lengths are broad and often bimodal in shape indicating a complex thermal history. Cooling below 120°C in the Early Cretaceous to Palaeogene was followed by a discrete heating episode during the late Eocene and subsequent cooling to surface temperature. The modelled time–temperature (t–T) paths point to a total denudation of the flanks of URG in the range of 1.0–1.7 km for a paleogeothermal gradient of 60°C/km, and 1.3–2.2 km for a paleogeothermal gradient of 45°C/km since the late Eocene.},

abstract = {This article provides a critical synopsis of the effects of groundwater flow on mineral diagenesis. Emphasis is placed on those aspects and processes that change porosity and permeability in carbonate aquifers, because they are of particular importance to human societies as sources of supplies of water for human consumption (drinking, irrigation) and of crude oil and natural gas. Diagenetic settings in carbonates as well as clastics are generally ill defined. This paper proposes a new comprehensive classification of diagenetic settings into near-surface, shallow-, intermediate-, and deep-burial diagenetic settings; hydrocarbon-contaminated plumes; and fractures. These settings are defined on the basis of mineralogy, petroleum, hydrogeochemistry, and hydro- geology. This classification is applicable to all sedimen- tary basins. Diagenesis is governed by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that include thermodynamic and kinetic constraints, as well as microstructural factors that may override the others. These factors govern diagenetic processes, such as dissolution, compaction, recrystallization, replacement, and sulfate–hydrocarbon redox-reactions. Processes such as cementation, disso- lution, and dolomitization require significant flow of groundwater driven by an externally imposed hydraulic gradient. Other processes, such as stylolitization and thermochemical sulfate reduction, commonly take place without significant groundwater flow in hydrolog- ically nearly or completely stagnant systems that are geochemically “closed.” Two major effects of groundwater flow on mineral diagenesis are enhancement and reduction of porosity and permeability, although groundwater flow can also leave these rock properties essentially unchanged.

Substantial retrograde hydrometamorphism in the temperature range 500° to 200° C resulted mineralogically in high-temperature chloritization of biotite, and low-temperature muscovitization as well as feldspar alteration, respectively.

We present fission track (FT) data on apatites, zircons and sphenes from the rift and surrounding areas in order to clarify its syn- and post-rift thermal evolution. Zircons and sphenes within the rift record FT ages of between ∼ 270 and 180 Ma (i.e., syn-post-rifting). In contrast, the Precambrian basement surrounding the graben yields zircon FT/sphene FT ages of ∼ 500–650 Ma, indicating that heating associated with rifting was focused inside the rift as a result of advective heat flow. Syn-rift to early post-rift temperatures reached > 240°C at the present erosion level in the graben. Syn-rift advective heating ( ∼ 260–270 Ma) was probably a result of large-scale batholith intrusion; post-rift ( ∼ 180–220 Ma) heating seems to have occurred by hydrothermal circulation of high-temperature (100–300°C) fluids. The FT data, organic geochemical indicators and fluid inclusions suggest that hydrothermal circulation followed a highly complex pattern controlled by the tectonic and volcanic structure of the rift. Apatite FT ages and confined track length distributions reveal the post-rift exhumation history of the area. Apatite FT ages are continuous within and outside the graben and decrease from Triassic (200–240 Ma) in the southeast to Jurassic ( ∼ 160 Ma) in the northwest, indicating that post-rift exhumation took place on a much larger scale than Permian rifting. Modelling of apatite FT ages and track lengths suggests cooling/denudation events in the Triassic, Jurassic and Neogene, accounting for a total post-Permian erosion of 3–4 km. Triassic-Jurassic denudation coincides with the migration of rifting from the Oslo-Skagerrak area to the North Sea/Danish Basin, as revealed by offshore seismic data, and caused destruction of the hydrothermal regime. Neogene uplift and erosion of the area is also supported by seismic evidence. The inferred timing and amount of regional post-rift erosion suggests that post-rift subsidence and sedimentation within the Oslo Graben was minimal.},

AHe and ZHe data record two episodes of rapid cooling related to the tectonic exhumation of the WR fault block beginning at $\sim$15 and $\sim$4 Ma. Extension was accommodated through fault-block rotation and variably tilted the southern WR to the west from $\sim$60°–70° in the central WR to $\sim$15°–35° in the southernmost WR and Pine Grove Hills, and minimal tilting in the Anchorite Hills and along the Mina Deflection to the south. Middle Miocene geothermal gradient estimates record heating immediately prior to large-magnitude extension that was likely coeval with the extrusion of the Lincoln Flat andesite at $\sim$14.8 Ma. Geothermal gradients increase from $\sim$19° ± 4°C/km to ≥ 65° ± 20°C/km toward the Mina Deflection, suggesting that it was the focus of Middle Miocene arc magmatism in the upper crust. The decreasing thickness of tilt blocks toward the south resulted from a shallowing brittle/ductile transition zone. Postmagmatic Middle Miocene extension and fault-block advection were focused in the northern and central WR and coincidentally moderated the large lateral thermal gradient within the uppermost crust.},

abstract = {Recent studies integrating geomorphology, thermochronology, cosmogenic erosion rate estimates, and numerical modeling suggest that escarpment evolution may take place following two dramatically different modes: (1) parallel retreat from the escarpment's original position at the continent-ocean boundary to its present-day inland position and (2) formation-in-place by progressive downwearing of a plateau initially located between the coast and a preexisting inland drainage divide. Using a three-dimensional finite element model to solve the heat transfer equation, we show that the mode of migration of a passive margin escarpment can be constrained by low-temperature (apatite (U-Th)/He) thermochronology. We first couple the heat equation solver to a surface processes model that predicts the two different escarpment evolution modes from only slightly different initial conditions. We predict (U-Th)/He age distributions that are markedly different for the two scenarios. We perform a thorough investigation of the model behavior to determine under which circumstances thermochronological data can be used to constrain passive margin escarpment dynamics. These conditions include (a) a tall escarpment, (b) a high geothermal gradient, and/or (c) a low flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. We demonstrate that to determine the rate and mode of escarpment migration from low-temperature thermochronology, one needs to collect samples along transects perpendicular as well as parallel to the escarpment. Tightest constraints on escarpment development are provided by (in ascending order) the minimum (U-Th)/He age encountered seaward of the escarpment, the location of where the minimum age is found, the slope of the age-distance relationship (in a direction perpendicular to the coast), and the slope of the age-elevation relationship (from a transect parallel to the escarpment). We finally demonstrate that there are situations where thermochronological data sets do not provide constraints on the mode of escarpment migration, such as along the escarpment of southeastern Australia, where migration has possibly been very rapid. Using the Neighborhood Algorithm method, we are, however, able to extract from an existing apatite (U-Th)/He data set very useful constraints on the evolution of the southeastern Australian escarpment, including the duration of the migration event (<15 Myr), the local geothermal gradient (32�–40�C km−1), and the effective elastic thickness of the underlying lithosphere (6–8 km).},

abstract = {Within the DEKORP project (DEKORP: Deutsches Kontinentales Reflexionsseismisches Programm) a joint deep seismic reflection venture with the BELCORP (Belgian Continental Reflection Seismic Programme) group of the Belgian Geological Survey was carried out in 1987 across the Rhenish Massif, a part of the mid-European Variscides. This orogenic belt developed in the Upper Devonian/Carboniferous. Mostly Devonian rocks crop out at the surface. The Rhenish Massif is bordered by two sedimentary troughs: the sub-Variscan Foredeep in the north and the Permo-Carboniferous Saar-Nahe Basin in the south. In the east-west direction it is subdivided by the axial depression of the Eifel Nord-S�d Zone. The aim of the survey which totals almost 220 km of seismic profiling, was to investigate the crustal structure of the western part of the Rhenish Massif and to compare it with the line DEKORP 2-N which crosses the eastern portion of the massif. The results indicate the presence of NW-vergent tectonics of various styles that can often be traced down to deep parts of the crust. Horizontal Variscan compression plays a dominant role in the northern part while post-Variscan extension seems to dominate in the Saar-Nahe Basin, although even there traces of Variscan compression seem to be preserved in the middle crust. Common characteristics of the pre-Palaeozoic basement, differences between the western and eastern parts of the Rhenish Massif, and the deep extension of the Aachen Thrust (Faille du Midi) have been clearly observed. This prominent thrust in the north with its characteristic ramp and flat structure has been followed over 100 km length down},

abstract = {The Southern Vosges host a large volcano-sedimentary basin which contains clastic sediments of Famennian (Late Devonian; ca. 365 Ma) to Late Visean (ca. 340-335 Ma) age. The basin is bordered by an exhumed high-grade basement complex and intruded by several granitoid plutons. A chronology for basin evolution and magmatism was established dating volcanic rocks of the basin as well as cross-cutting granitoid rocks by the UPb technique applied to zircon and titanite: The basin evolution started with olistolithic deposits and overlying marine shales that have a Famennian fauna (ca. 365 Ma) and contain detrital zircons with an age of 386 Ma. The lowermost rhyolite flows interlayered with the basin sediments and tholeiitic basalts yielded an age of 345 ± 2 Ma. Following a tectonic event at the bottom of the Upper Visean, the rates of sedimentation and volcanism were strongly enhanced, leading to basin emersion, and were concluded by the extrusion of the uppermost ignimbrite (Molkenrain rhyolite) emplaced at 340 ± 2 Ma. The whole volcano-sedimentary association was subsequently intruded by melts of the Ballons and Creˆtes granites as well as by small monzodioritic and dioritic satellite intrusions along the border of the Ballons granite within 3 ± 2 myr (342 ± 1 to 339.5 ± 2.5 Ma). The zircons of most of the volcanic and plutonic rocks investigated contain inherited lead of 0.6 and 2.1 Ga age. The differences in initial Nd isotopic composition of the Ballons and Creˆtes granites can be explained by differential uptake of crustal material during magma genesis. The precise age data prove that magmatism and basin formation in the Southern Vosges were extremely short-lived and coeval to the exhumation of adjacent high-grade gneiss terrains, revealing an episode of extension at the end of the Lower Carboniferous between 345 and 340 Ma (Visean). The tectonic regime in the internal part of the Variscan orogen is that of extension and strike-slip, while convergent tectonics were still ongoing in the external part of the Variscan orogen.},

abstract = {In Africa, groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is forecast to increase substantially to combat growing food insecurity. Despite this, there is little quantitative information on groundwater resources in Africa, and groundwater storage is consequently omitted from assessments of freshwater availability. Here we present the first quantitative continent-wide maps of aquifer storage and potential borehole yields in Africa based on an extensive review of available maps, publications and data. We estimate total groundwater storage in Africa to be 0.66 million km3 (0.36–1.75 million km3). Not all of this groundwater storage is available for abstraction, but the estimated volume is more than 100 times estimates of annual renewable freshwater resources on Africa. Groundwater resources are unevenly distributed: the largest groundwater volumes are found in the large sedimentary aquifers in the North African countries Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Sudan. Nevertheless, for many African countries appropriately sited and constructed boreholes can support handpump abstraction (yields of 0.1–0.3 l/s), and contain sufficient storage to sustain abstraction through inter-annual variations in recharge. The maps show further that the potential for higher yielding boreholes ( > 5 l/s) is much more limited. Therefore, strategies for increasing irrigation or supplying water to rapidly urbanizing cities that are predicated on the widespread drilling of high yielding boreholes are likely to be unsuccessful. As groundwater is the largest and most widely distributed store of freshwater in Africa, the quantitative maps are intended to lead to more realistic assessments of water security and water stress, and to promote a more quantitative approach to mapping of groundwater resources at national and regional level.},

abstract = {Many basins show deviations from the simple subsidence pattern predicted by the stretching model for basin evolution. Incorporating finite strength of the lithosphere during rifting and stresses acting on the lithosphere during the post-rift phase of basin evolution can successfully explain these deviations. Finite strength of the lithosphere during rifting causes flexurally supported rift-shoulders. The erosion of these rift-shoulders induces both additional uplift at the basin margin and sediment loading-induced subsidence in the basin centre, causing tilting of syn-rift sediments. A ‘break-up' unconformity results from the progressive diminishing of this tilting towards the end of the rifting period, separating the syn- and post-rift sediments. As the amount of erosion is primarily controlled by climatic conditions, basins having the same tectonic history but, for example, located at different lattitudes will not have developed the same pattern of stratigraphic fill. The same effect is expected if another mechanism causes the uplift of the basin margin, as, for example, a change in the level of intraplate stress.   Plate reorganizations are the main cause for changes in the level of intraplate stress. We demonstrate that the in-plane stress variations affect the fluid flow regime in rifted basins, with possible implications for the diagenesis of sediments, primary migration of hydrocarbons, faulting and localization of economic resources. Examples include the North Sea and Pannonian Basin. An increase in the level of compressive stress causes flank uplift and basin centre subsidence, inducing a contemporaneous increase of meteroic water influx and compaction-driven fluid overpressures. An increase in the level of tensile inplane stress induces the opposite effects. },

abstract = {The abundance of K in the silicate Earth provides control on the composition of the Earth's interior, the dominant mode of mantle convection, the thermal evolution of the planet, and the concentration of Pb in the core. Because K acts as a volatile species during accretion, the K content of the silicate Earth is determined as a function of the terrestrial K/U ratio. A comprehensive examination of MORB from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, including both normal- and enriched-type samples, reveals a composite MORB source K/U ratio of 19,000 ?? 2600 (2??). In comparison, ocean island basalts and average continental crust have average K/U values of 11,900 ?? 2200 and 13,000 ?? 3000, respectively. The fractional contributions of these reservoirs establishes the K/U ratio of the silicate Earth to be 13,800 ?? 2600 (2??), equating to 280 ?? 120????g/g K in the silicate Earth. As a result, the planet's convective Urey ratio is verified to be $\sim$ 0.34, which indicates a current mantle cooling rate of 70-130??K Gyr- 1 after taking into account potential heat flux across the core-mantle boundary. Additionally, the Earth's balance of radiogenic heat flow and budget of 40Ar necessitate a lower mantle reservoir enriched in radioactive elements. The bulk Earth Pb/U ratio, determined here to be $\sim$ 85, suggests $\sim$ 1200??ng/g Pb in the bulk Earth and ??? 3300??ng/g Pb in the core. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {New low-temperature thermochronological data have been used to quantify the protracted, Eocene-Miocene cooling histories of upper and lower plate rocks of the Kesebir-Kardamos extensional dome, Eastern Rhodopes, Bulgaria.40Ar/39Ar and apatite fission-track data reveal that the lower plate has experienced continuous cooling and exhumation, since the Late Eocene. Muscovite40Ar/39Ar plateau ages of 36.90 ± 0.16 Ma and 37.28 ± 0.19 Ma (2$\sigma$) from metamorphic rocks of the footwall reveal the approximate time span during which they cooled below ∼ 350 °C during exhumation caused by detachment faulting. The sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization, which represents a thermal event at ∼ 250-220 °C, developed during the early stage of basin formation between 34.71 ± 0.16 Ma and 35.36 ± 0.21 Ma (adularia40Ar/39Ar plateau ages; 2$\sigma$). The termination of hydrothermal mineral deposition at Ada Tepe occurred contemporaneously with the earliest phase of calc-alkaline type magmatism at Iran Tepe (33.97 ± 0.36 Ma to 34.62 ± 0.46 Ma, hornblende and biotite40Ar/39Ar plateau ages, 2$\sigma$). Thermal history modelling of apatite fission-track data shows that the lower plate rocks cooled through ∼ 120 °C at ∼ 18.3 ± 1.9 Ma (1$\sigma$). A time-temperature model obtained from zircon and apatite fission-track data from the upper plate reveals that it was being buried during the late Eocene. At ∼ 33-30 Ma, a dramatic change of the time-temperature path was caused by the initiation of horst-graben structures, resulting in rapid exhumation of the upper plate. Our new thermochronological data reveal many aspects of the mechanisms of formation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits. The heat accumulated during sedimentary burial of the upper plate is a plausible heat source to drive hydrothermal fluid circulation and ore formation. The development of large half-graben basins in the hanging walls of detachment faults, accompanied by a favourable climate, may have created a situation that was adequate to capture a primary meteoric water supply that subsequently underwent hydrothermal convection. Our new40Ar/39Ar age data indicate that magmatic activity was contemporaneous with gold deposition and must be considered as a source of heat, sulphur and/or a metal for the ore-forming hydrothermal system. The preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted ore deposits is largely controlled by the exhumation history of the upper plate, which has been quantitatively constrained by low-temperature thermochronological methods, and commences with rapid exhumation at ∼ 33-30 Ma. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Feldbiss fault is the main active fault bounding to the southwest the Roer Valley Graben of NW Europe. In order to investigate the reasons of the discrepancy between its short- and long-term slip rate estimates, we have repeatedly surveyed a 2.3 km-long line by levelling at Sittard (The Netherlands) from April 2001 to December 2004. Simultaneously, three superposed aquifers were monitored on both sides of the fault. The across-fault differential groundwater variations are shown to be responsible for a seasonal 0.87 mm/m vertical motion of the fault, mainly through the effect of pore pressure changes in confined aquifers. After removal of this effect, I get a residual trend of - 0.60 [plus-or-minus sign] 0.11 mm/yr for the relative motion of the hangingwall. This trend was disturbed in the summer of 2002 by transient millimetre-level up and down motions temporally associated with the small Eschweiler earthquake that occurred on July 22, 2002 on the Feldbiss fault at a distance of 35 km from Sittard. I explain this as a creep event triggered by the passage of trapped seismic waves. The subsisting discrepancy between the long-term slip rate of 0.06 mm/yr and short-term rates of 1.5 mm/yr (from 1962 to 2001) and 0.6 mm/yr (from 2001 to 2004) is tentatively interpreted as resulting from the current occurrence of a decade-long episode of aseismic slip involving a large part of the fault plane. Occasionally associated with minor seismicity, this aseismic slip event could betray a thickening of the transitional region located below the upper crustal zone of stable sliding. It causes a total fault slip of 5-10 cm in a few tens of years, releasing smoothly all, or a great part of, the strain accumulated during the previous 1-2 ky of fault quiescence.},

ANNs have also been trained to discriminate carbonates from clastic mudstones and also give a preliminary indication of the extent to which mudstones are lithified or cemented. Results show that for clay content, 85% of predictions are within ±10% of the measured value; for TOC, 92% of predictions are within ±1% of the measured value; for grain density, 91% of predictions are within ±0.07 g cm−3 of the measured value; for the discrimination of carbonates from clastics, 98.3% of carbonate samples and 99.9% of non-carbonate samples are classified correctly. The ANNs work well not only in the areas from where training data were measured, but also (as an example) in offshore West Africa. Potential applications of the technique include (1) the possibility to define the 3D sedimentary architecture of mudstone sequences from wireline data and, because both the porosity–effective stress and porosity–permeability relationships of mudstones are strongly influenced by clay content, (2) more accurate, basin-scale fluid flow modelling. },

Measurements from grids of 40 seepage meters provide a detailed representation of groundwater flux in both space and time. At the head of the bay, a distinct band of high, saline discharge was observed between 25 and 45 m from the shoreline. Slug tests indicated no pattern of permeability to explain the band of discharge, and the band was not observed offshore of an island where freshwater discharge is negligible. Experiments using clusters of seepage meters showed large variability in discharge at the meter scale and similar temporal variation throughout the domain, reflecting tidal influence primarily near shore. The small-scale variability challenges the assumption of locally homogeneous flow used in many models, and the band of discharge contradicts predictions that total outflow is largely fresh and decreases monotonically from shore.},

abstract = {The relationship of strain accumulation to strain release over different timescales provides insight to the dynamics, structural development, and spatial and temporal pattern of earthquake recurrence in regions of active tectonics. The Great Basin physiographic province of the western United States is one of the Earthﾒs broadest regions of ongoing continental extension, encompassing an area reaching  800 km in width between the Sierra Nevada to the west and Wasatch mountains to the east. We present observations arising from excavations, scarp profiling, optically stimulated luminescence, and radiocarbon dating to place limits on the late Pleistocene paleoseismic history of faults bounding eight ranges across the interior of the northern Great Basin, specifically, the Shawave, Hot Springs, Humboldt, Sonoma, Shoshone, Tuscarora, Dry Hills, and Pequop ranges. Combining the observations with similar previously published studies within and at the margins of the Great Basin yields a transect that extends eastward across the basin between the 40th and 41st parallels. The sum of observations provides a picture of the patterns and rates of earthquake recurrence over the region during the last  20 45 kyr that may be compared to patterns of contemporary seismicity and recently reported measures of strain accumulation across the area using GPS. The recurrence rate of large surface rupture paleoearthquakes along ranges at the margins of the Great Basin is systematically greater than observed along ranges in the interior. The pattern is similar to seismological and geodetic measurements that show levels of background seismicity and strain accumulation are also concentrated along the margins of the Great Basin. An east-west extension rate across the interior of the Great Basin on the order of 1/2 mm/yr(strain rate of  1 nstrain yr 1) over the last  20 45 kyr is estimated by summing the record of paleoseismic displacements across the 400 km breadth of the transect, as compared to  2 mm/yr of strain accumulation indicated by a recently reported analysis of a collinear GPS survey. The comparison is hindered by significant uncertainties coupled to the geologic rate estimate. The transect also crosses the northern limit of the central Nevada seismic belt. The central Nevada seismic belt is defined by a north-northeast trending alignment of historical surface rupture earthquakes, increased levels of background seismicity, and strain accumulation rates greater than observed elsewhere in the interior of the Great Basin. The reported recurrence rate of late Pleistocene surface rupture earthquakes within the central Nevada seismic belt is also generally greater than observed along our transect. The observations when taken together suggest that the characteristics of strain release observed historically within the central Nevada seismic belt have been operative over the latest Pleistocene and that the apparently greater rates of strain accumulation and release in the central Nevada seismic belt are diminished or less localized in regions to the north and east. Thus, while the historical alignment of surface ruptures that defines the central Nevada seismic belt remains a unique clustering of earthquakes in time and space, the likelihood of the cluster at its observed location appears greater than would be expected to the north or eastward in the interior of the Great Basin.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Thermal springs are widespread in the European Alps, with hundreds of geothermal sites known and exploited. The thermal circulation and fluid outflows were examined in the area around Bormio (Central Italian Alps), where ten geothermal springs discharge from dolomite bodies located close to the regional Zebr{\`{u}} thrust. Water is heated in deep circulation systems and upwells vigorously at a temperature of about 40 °C. Heat and fluid transport is explored by steady and transient three-dimensional finite-element simulations taking into account the effect of the last glaciation, which in the study area was recognized to end around 11,000–12,000 years ago. The full regional model (ca. 700 km 2 ) is discretized with a highly refined triangular finite-element planar grid. Numerical simulations suggest a reactivation of the system following the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. Results correctly simulate the observed discharge rate of ca. 2,400 L/min and the spring temperatures after ca. 13,000 years from deglaciation, and show a complete cooling of the aquifer within a period of approximately 50,000 years. Groundwater flow and temperature patterns suggest that thermal water flows through a deep system crossing both sedimentary and metamorphic lithotypes along a fracture network associated with the thrust system. This example gives insights into the influences of deep alpine structures and glaciations on groundwater circulation that control the development of many hydrothermal systems not necessarily associated with convective heat flow.},

Transmissivity values determined from fluid injection, aquifer testing, and flowmeter measurements generally fall in the range of 8.1E-08 to 9.95E-06 m2/s and correspond to various scales of investigation. The analysis of acoustic and optical BHTV images reveals two primary fracture sets within the dolerite and the sedimentary rocks—subhorizontal fractures, intersected by subvertical ones. Despite being highly fractured either with subhorizontal, subvertical or both fracture populations, the dolerite above and the sedimentary rocks below the contact zone and the zone with the layers of chilled dolerite are significantly less conductive. The distribution of the particular conductive intervals is not a function of the two dominant fracture populations or their density but rather of the intrusion path of the sill. The intrusion caused thermal fracturing and cracking of both formations, resulting in higher permeability along the contact zone.},

abstract = {All Dutch rift basins that formed during Jurassic and Early Cretaceous extension have been inverted during the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. Several inversion pulses occurred more or less simultaneously in all basins. Analysis of vitrinite reflectance data, in combination with fission track and fluid inclusion data show that the magnitude of uplift and erosion generally did not exceed 2 km. Inversion was strongest in the Broad Fourteens, Central Netherlands and West Netherlands basins. The direction of maximum compressive stress was generally not at right angles to the pre-existing fault trends, and resulted in transpressional movements. Within the NW-SE striking basins, dextral strike-slip movements can often be interpreted, which is consistent with a general N-S to NNW-SSE direction of maximum compression related to Alpine structural events. Where no Zechstein salt is present, trends of flower structures formed through reverse reactivation of pre-existing faults. Where the Zechstein salt is thick, re-activated faults could not breach the salt, and a broad uplift of the post-salt succession resulted, while faulting below the salt caused acceleration of halokinesis. In area where the Zechstein salt was thin, and where the offsets of reverse faults exceeded the thickness of the salt, impressive thrusts with the Zechstein salt as detachment horizon developed. The later Tertiary inversion pulses did not affect all basins, and caused broad basin uplift in the West and Central Netherlands basins while individual faults were no longer reactivated. It appears that due to crustal thickening during the first inversion pulses the crust could become stabilised such that further compression could only be accommodated by broad basin uplift.},

abstract = {Abstract A basin model was built to simulate in three dimensions the 248 Myr geological history of the Paris basin, France, i.e. sedimentation, erosion, compaction heat and fluid flow. This multidisciplinary study was based on a detailed stratigraphic database of more than 1100 well logs together with a hydrodynamic database of 1000 data (heads and permeabilities). The region covers a maximum surface area of 700 000 km2. The NEWBAS code of the Ecole des Mines de Paris was used in order to simulate compaction and heat and fluid flow. Three examples of the use of this model are given to illustrate different features of the geological functioning of the basin. (i) By modelling processes such as sedimentation, compaction, fluid and heat flow, the model provides estimates of the hydraulic conductivity fields within one order of magnitude from observations at the regional scale. This permeability field can reproduce the present-day observed pressures and fluxes in the basin. (ii) Observed excess pressures in the main aquitards are considered as possible consequences of the geological history of the basin. The calculated excess pressures are small and stay within the range of the measured values, between 0 and 2.75 MPa, close to the pressures in the aquifers. However, the weak excess pressures measured in the Callovo-Oxfordian sequence in the eastern part of the basin are not reproduced by the model. Mechanisms other than compaction disequilibrium must be invoked. (iii) This model also calculates regional-scale palaeofluid flow whose value is currently arbitrarily assumed by geochemists when studying diagenetic processes. Hence, it provides a hydrologic background for diagenetic models. The cementation in the western Keuper reservoirs was investigated. Topographically driven flow during tectonic inversion periods, e.g. the Lower Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, is shown to be a plausible cause of brine migrations. This brine displacement would then explain the high salinities recorded in the fluid inclusions trapped in the Keuper cements. The conditions for the migration would have been most favourable at the time of the maximum burial, i.e. the Early Tertiary and not the Early Cretaceous as previously suggested.},

abstract = {A numerical model has been developed to predict the evolution and degree of incision and deposition by fluvial channels on the continental shelf during sea level cycles. Rainfall-runoff, mass wasting processes, and fluvial sediment entrainment and transport are simulated using the detachment-limited model of Howard [1994] on a grid that represents the morphology of the continental shelf and corresponding coastal plain. The model is coupled with a deltaic module for sediment deposition in the ocean and a fluctuating sea level that mimics climatic changes on a 104 year timescale. The model indicates that the detailed structure of sea level oscillations has a strong influence upon sediment redistribution and channel development on the shelf. In particular, high- frequency sea level oscillations increase fluvial incision in the terminal reaches of the rivers due to rapid downcutting during the low stands of the oscillation. It is shown that the increment of incision at the river mouth is directly proportional to the oscillation amplitude. Furthermore, simulations indicate that an increase in river sediment load driven by climatic change favors channel avulsion with the formation of new fluvial incisions on the shelf. Results also show the strong influence of shelf morphology on establishing channel networks during sea level low stands.},

Permeability is computed from changes in the mineral volume fractionsresulting from precipitation and dissolution of the rock-forming mineral as fluid flows throughvariable salinity and temperature fields. Its evolution is controlled by a power—law relationship,in which a weighting coefficient is assigned to clay minerals. This approach allows theincorporation of the widely observed influence of clay content on the porosity—permeabilityrelationship. A synthetic example is set up to analyze the sensitivity of the results to a set offour controlling parameters: the effect of the clay-weighting coefficient compared to the effectof the salinity gradient, temperature gradient, and exponent coefficient of the permeabilityevolution law. Using a large range of values for these parameters, the results show that theirinfluence is of equivalent magnitude in terms of permeability evolution rate. It also seemsthat the value of the clay-weighting coefficient affects the evolution trend: permeability mayincrease when the porosity decreases (and vice versa). The model is compared to the classicalapproach for which permeability is a function of porosity change only. Results display thestrong influence of even low values of the clay-weighting coefficient on the permeabilitychange. Consequently, the specific influence of mineral transfers on pore structure changes isa key parameter for modeling permeability changes and cannot be bypassed by the use ofsimple porosity—permeability evolution law.},

abstract = {With the beginning of the new century, the European EGS Project got into its decisive state by reaching the final reservoir depth of 5�km. The three boreholes, GPK2, GPK3 and GPK4 have been successfully targeted at their predefined reservoir positions. Improvement of the reservoir conditions by stimulation with a minimized seismic risk represents now a primary challenge to enable economic operation and future extension. In this context, the new HEX-S code has been developed to simulate the transient hydro-mechanical response of the rock matrix to massive hydraulic injections. The present paper describes the successful forecast of the pressure response and shearing locations for the GPK4 stimulation in September 2004. As basis for this predictive modeling, the reservoir model was derived from data analysis of the stimulation of GPK3 in May 2003. Stimulation flow rates up to 45�l/s at GPK4 and of >60�l/s at GPK3 have been applied, triggering several 10,000 of microseismic events. The transient numerical simulations with the HEX-S code match the main characteristics of both, the microseismic and the hydraulic behavior. Different model calculations demonstrate the capabilities of our new approach. It is noteworthy that the modeling became possible only due to the excellent data quality at the Soultz project. The results demonstrate that simulations based on solid physical ground can reveal the complex reservoir behavior during hydraulic stimulation. The use of HEX-S also provides perspectives for future developments such as design calculations that enable optimizing cost-intensive hydraulic stimulations before hand.},

abstract = {Abstract Low-temperature thermochronology provides information on the timing of rifting and denudation of passive margins, and the Red Sea with its well-exposed, young rift margins is a suitable setting for its application. Here we present new apatite fission-track (AFT) data from Sudan northern hinterland and Red Sea coastal areas. From the former region we obtained ages between 270 ± 2 Ma ad 253 ± 53 Ma, and from the coastal belt between 83 ± 8 Ma and 39 ± 7 Ma. These data prompted a review and comparison with low-temperature thermochronological data from the whole Nubian Red Sea Margin, and a discussion on their implication in assessing the margin evolutionary style. AFT data are available for Egypt and Eritrea as well as apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) ages for two transects transversal to the margin in Eritrea. Both in Egypt and Eritrea AFT data record a cooling event at about 20–25 Ma (Early Miocene) and an earlier, more local, cooling event in Egypt at about 34 Ma (Early Oligocene). The thermal modeling of the Sudan samples provides an indication of a rapid cooling in Miocene times, but does not support nor rules out an Early Oligocene cooling phase. The re-assessment of new and existing thermochronological data within the known geological framework of the Nubian and conjugate Arabian margins favours the hypothesis that early rifting stages were affecting the whole Gulf of Suez–Red Sea–Gulf of Aden system since the Oligocene. These precocious, more attenuated, phases were followed by major extension in Miocene times.As to the mode of margin evolution, AFT age patterns both in Egypt and Eritrea are incompatible with a downwarp model. The distribution of AHe ages across the Eritrean coastal plain suggests that there the escarpment was evolving predominantly by plateau degradation.

The topography of these surfaces is integral to earthquake and fault mechanics, but is practically unknown at the scale of earthquake slip. We use new laser-based methods to map exposed fault surfaces over scales of 10 {micro}m to 120 m. These data provide the first quantitative evidence that fault-surface roughness evolves with increasing slip. Thousands of profiles ranging from 10 {micro}m to >100 m in length show that small-slip faults (slip <1 m) are rougher than large-slip faults (slip 10-100 m or more) parallel to the slip direction. Surfaces of small-slip faults have asperities over the entire range of observed scales, while large-slip fault surfaces are polished, with RMS values of <3 mm on profiles as long as 1-2 m. The large-slip surfaces show smooth, elongate, quasi-elliptical bumps that are meters long and as high as [$\sim$]1 m. We infer that these bumps evolve during fault maturation. This difference in geometry implies that the nucleation, growth, and termination of earthquakes on evolved faults are fundamentally different than on new ones.},

Zircon data provide evidence for widespread (hydro)thermal activity during the Permian and Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous. Apatite ages indicate a major cooling event in the mid Cretaceous (∼89–72 Ma) reflecting the time of inversion of the LSB. During the Cretaceous, the cooling of the basin centre was rapid compared to the basin margins.

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated the dependence of fission track annealing kinetics on at least some aspects of apatite chemical composition. Practical applications of this knowledge are limited, however, by the time and expense of the explicit determination of apatite composition (most commonly by electron microprobe). Another approach is to determine composition implicitly using a measurable parameter that itself varies with composition. Bulk etching velocity is one such parameter. This study primarily concerns etch figure dimensions on prismatic surfaces of apatite and their correlation with F-, Cl-, and OH-content. An etch figure is the cross-sectional geometry of an etch pit-at the etched surface. The apatites were etched in 5.5M HNO3 at 21.0(+0.5)°C for 20(+1)s. The etch figure dimensions were measured using an optical microscope and reflected light at 1250X. F- and CI- weight percentages for the apatites were measured explicitly using an electron microprobe; OH- was calculated by difference assuming stoichiometry between the various cations and anions analyzed. Results indicate the following correlations between the etch figure diameter parallel to the crystallographic c-axis (dpar) and weight percent anion (F-): F- = 4.67-1.31*dpar+0.04176*dpar^2 (R^2=0.765) Similar expressions are possible Ci- and OH- concentration as well. Several factors appear to complicate this implicit method of chemical composition determination, including a) lack of strict control on etching conditions, b) trace element composition, and c) bulk defect concentration in the apatite.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The impact of 3D groundwater dynamics as part of the hydrologic cycle is rarely considered in regional climate simulation experiments. However, there exists a spatial and temporal connection between groundwater and soil moisture near the land surface, which can influence the land surface-atmosphere feedbacks during heat waves. This study assesses the sensitivity of bedrock-to-atmosphere simulations to groundwater representations at the continental scale during the European heat wave 2003 using an integrated fully coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere model. The analysis is based on the comparison of two groundwater configurations: (1) 3D physics-based variably saturated groundwater dynamics and (2) a 1D free drainage (FD) approach. Furthermore, two different subsurface hydrofacies distributions (HFD) account for the uncertainty of the subsurface hydraulic characteristics, and ensemble simulations address the uncertainty arising from different surface-subsurface initial conditions. The results show that the groundwater representation significantly impacts land surface-atmosphere processes. Differences between the two groundwater configurations follow subsurface patterns, and the largest differences are observed for shallow water table depths. While the physics-based setup is less sensitive to the HFD, the parameterized FD simulations are highly sensitive to the hydraulic characteristics of the subsurface. An analysis of variance shows that both, the groundwater configuration and the HFD, induce variability across all compartments with decreasing impact from the subsurface to the atmosphere, while the initial condition has only a minor impact.},

abstract = {Parts of the Australian continent, including the Otway Basin of the southern Australian margin, exhibit unusually high levels of neotectonic deformation for a so-called stable continental region. The onset of deformation in the Otway Basin is marked by a regional Miocene–Pliocene unconformity and inversion and exhumation of the Cretaceous–Cenozoic basin fill by up to c. 1 km. While it is generally agreed that this deformation is controlled by a mildly compressional intraplate stress field generated by the interaction of distant plate-boundary forces, it is less clear whether the present-day record of deformation manifested by seismicity is representative of the longer-term geological record of deformation. We present estimates of strain rates in the eastern Otway Basin since 10 Ma based on seismic moment release, geological observations, exhumation measurements and structural restorations. Our results demonstrate significant temporal variation in bulk crustal strain rates, from a peak of c. 2×10−16 s−1 in the Miocene–Pliocene to c. 1.09×10−17 s−1 at the present day, and indicate that the observed exhumation can be accounted for solely by crustal shortening. The Miocene–Pliocene peak in tectonic activity, along with the orthogonal alignment of inverted post-Miocene structures to measured and predicted maximum horizontal stress orientations, validates the notion that plate-boundary forces are capable of generating mild but appreciable deformation and uplift within continental interiors.},

The large-scale geometry of the Eastern Alps and the spatial distribution of upper, and lower crustal layers, and the lithospheric mantle is constrained by the deep seismic line. Two rheological models, coupled to a kinematic thermal model that accounts for the thermal evolution of the Eastern Alps for the last 30 Myr, are investigated for the present-day lithospheric configuration in the Eastern Alps. Models with strong (Model A) and weak (Model B) crustal rheologies predict the European and the Adriatic plates to be stronger than the central zone of the orogen comprising the region between the Inntal Fault and the Periadriatic Fault. Model A is characterized by a brittle-ductile boundary between 14 and 9 km depth and strong coupling of the mechanically strong lower crust to the upper mantle, whereas Model B suggests the presence of a thick decoupling zone between the upper crust and the upper mantle and a shallower brittle-ductile boundary (7-10 km). Of these end-member scenarios, Model A is in better agreement with neotectonic data including seismicity down to the upper-lower crust boundary within the Adriatic plate, uplift of the central zone of the Eastern Alps and the Southern Alps, and eastward escape of fault-bound blocks. Such deformation pattern is best explained by lateral extrusion upon north-south compression supporting a strong-weak-strong configuration of tectonic units along the TRANSALP line.

The results are used to investigate carbonate-shale interactions between the near-surface realm of microbially mediated diagenesis and the deep thermobaric regime of clay mineral transformations and hydrocarbon generation. They are also combined with published data from cements in stratigraphically and geographically adjacent strata to better understand the Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic palaeohydrology of central-eastern England (East Midlands Shelf-Midland Platform).Shallow burial cements sampled from the Blisworth Limestone Formation consist of ferroan calcite and calcic ankerite, which are associated with ferroan neomorphic calcite and ”beef” (cone-in-cone) calcite veins. Calcite cements are petrographically complex and variable, yet record consistent compositional trends. Carbon isotope values (delta13C=-1.2%% to +1.7%% PDB) show that organic matter breakdown did not contribute significant carbon to the shallow burial pore fluids. Oxygen isotope data (delta18O=-4.5%% to -11.2%% PDB) are consistent with precipitation from modified marine pore fluids that displaced the original brackish depositional fluids from the limestone during Palaeocene burial. The same fluids accompanied cementation in underlying Bajocian limestones. Ferroan calcite cements, neomorphic spar and ”beef” record a surprising correlation in Fe2+ and Mg2+ concentration that suggests a common source for the ions in the adjacent shales. This trend is not present in the Bajocian limestones and indicates that ionic mass transfer was on a smaller scale than the regional ”plumbing system”.The results suggest that Middle Jurassic limestone palaeoaquifers on the East Midlands Shelf hosted a westerly-directed, up-dip flow from compacting Upper and Lower Jurassic marine mudrocks in the Sole Pit Basin during the Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. However, Early Cretaceous meteoric groundwater palaeoaquifers recorded from cements in laterally equivalent Middle Jurassic limestones on the Midlands Platform and in the Weald Basin appear not to have extended northward into the East Midlands Shelf.},

The relationships between the age at a point in the water-body and the recharge depends on whether the aquifer is confined or unconfined. For an unconfined aquifer receiving recharge over the whole surface area a simple relationship is deduced. Such an aquifer can be characterized by its age at half-depth. Natural radiocarbon has been used to study flow patterns and flow-rates of subterranean water bodies in different regions in the Netherlands. The deep groundwater in the south-east region of the IJsselmeer presents a complicated situation caused by the inhomogeneity of the strata. Flow-rates are therefore not so readily deduced, but the different aquifers can be distinguished by using the isotopes 14C, 13C and 18O as natural tracers. In the province of Friesland the deep groundwater shows a more consistent picture with flow times of several thousand years corresponding to a quite acceptable flow-rate of around 10 m/yr. A much faster turnover time is observed in the unconfined fresh-water aquifer on the island of Schiermonnikoog. The hydrological parameters as deduced from 14C and tritium measurements compare reasonably well with expectation.},

abstract = {Observations from deep boreholes at several locations worldwide indicate that (i) hydrostatic pore pressures persist to depths of as much as 12 km in the upper crust, (ii) the brittle crust is in a state of failure equilibrium according to Coulomb frictional-failure theory, and (iii) bulk permeability is high - 10-17 - 10-16 m2 - apparently due to fluid flow along critically stressed faults. As a result of these factors, the brittle crust is stronger than it would be under near-lithostatic pore pressure conditions. This result provides a constraint on models of lithospheric deformation. Postulating that the upper and lower crust and lithospheric mantle are totally coupled and that the total strength of the lithosphere is equal to the magnitude of tectonic driving forces (∼ 3 × 1012 N m-1), we have calculated lithospheric strain rates under representative thermal and theological conditions such that the integrated differential stress over the entire thickness of the lithosphere equals the plate driving force. For a strike-slip stress state and surface heat flow of 60 ± 6 mW m-2, average strain rates are approximately 10-18 s-1 under hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressure conditions, and approximately 10-15 s-1 under near-lithostatic pore pressures. The latter strain rates are higher than either observed geodetically using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), or estimated on the basis of plate tectonic reconstructions. Hence we argue that hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressures enable lithospheric plates to behave rigidly over time scales of tens to hundreds of millions of years. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Equations are presented for the drawdown distribution in systems of infinite extent, caused by wells penetrating one or more of the aquifers completely and discharging each layer at a constant rate. Since the solution obtained may be regarded as a combined analytical-numerical technique, a type of one-dimensional modelling can be applied to find approximate solutions for several complicating conditions. Numerical evaluations are presented as time-drawdown curves and include effects of storage in the aquitard, unconfined conditions, partially penetrating wells and stratified aquifers. The outcome of calculations for relatively simple systems compares very well with published corresponding results. The proposed multilayer solution can be a valuable tool in aquifer test evaluation, as it provides the analytical expression required to enable the application of existing computer methods to the determination of aquifer characteristics. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Based on the wealth of data generated by the oil industry, the regional-scale characteristics of rocks, the flow of formation waters, and their relation to hydrocarbon accumulations were analyzed for the northern Alberta basin. The flow of formation waters in several aquifers and aquifer systems separated by intervening aquitards is at steady state and is driven by the present-day topography both on a regional and a local scale. The flow is generally from a recharge area in the southwest at the fold belt and Bovie Lake fault, to discharge in the northeast at the Great Slave Lake, the lowest point in the basin. The flow in Devonian aquifers is in open systems from recharge to discharge areas, whereas the flow in Carboniferous and Cretaceous aquifers is in semi-open systems, discharging into adjacent aquitards. Very high porosity and permeability in places in the Devonian Elk Point aquifer system are due to reefs, fracturing, dolomitization, and karst processes. Very high permeability probably leads to relatively high flow rates along the Presqu'ile barrier reef, resulting in local advective effects on the terrestrial heat transport to the surface. On a regional scale, all of the aquifers are underpressurized due to upstream propagation through high-permeability zones of low hydraulic heads at discharge elevations. The flow pattern is corroborated by salinity distributions, with comparatively lower salinity in each aquifer at recharge in the southwest and at discharge in the northeast caused by mixing with fresher meteoric water, and higher salinity between recharge and discharge areas. Salinity distributions show that the aquifers are not completely flushed of the original formation waters. Dissolution of salt and anhydrite from adjacent strata leads to high salinity in the Elk Point aquifer system and Beaverhill Lake aquifer. Hydrocarbons generated in the southwest in Devonian and Carboniferous strata, at maximum burial depth during the Laramide orogeny, migrated updip to the northeast driven by their own buoyancy and entrained by the flow of formation waters. Unless stratigraphically trapped by reefs and at the edge of semi-open aquifers, migration to the discharge areas led to loss of the volatile components and biodegradation into altered bitumens. The hydrostratigraphy and direction of the flow of formation waters in the northern part of the Alberta basin indicate that hydrocarbons generated in this region did not contribute to the formation of the giant Athabasca oil sand deposit located southeast of the study area.},

abstract = {Misconceptions regarding the fission track dating method prompt the description of five handling procedures and the derivation of commonly used system calibrations. Problems of registration geometry, inhomogeneous uranium distribution, accumulated radiation damage and anisotropic etching largely invalidate all but the population and external detector methods, and impose strict limitations upon even their routine application. Complexities of unique, absolute thermal neutron dosimetry are illustrated by the calibration and use of the NBS pre-irradiated glass SRM 962. The 20% disparity in measured [lambda]f decay constant values cannot be isolated from neutron fluence ([phi]) measurement and calibration. Frequently a calibration ratio ([phi]/[lambda]f) is evaluated against an age standard and then split into its component parts. To illustrate this interdependence of [lambda]f and [phi], zircon fission track ages, in agreement with independent KAr ages, are obtained by calculating the same track count data with each of the preferred values of [lambda]f ([lambda]f = 7.03 � 10-17yr-1and8.46 � 10-17yr-1) together with appropriate, selected neutron dosimetry schemes. An alternative approach is presented, formally relating unknown ages of samples to known ages of standards, either by direct comparison of standard and sample track densities, or by the repeated calibration of a glass against age standards. Practical recommendations are given for the reporting and critical assessment of fission track data.},

abstract = {We present a synoptic overview of the Mio- cene-present development of the northern Alpine foreland basin (Molasse Basin), with special attention to the pattern of surface erosion and sediment discharge in the Alps. Erosion of the Molasse Basin started at the same time that the rivers originating in the Central Alps were deflected toward the Bresse Graben, which formed part of the Euro- pean Cenozoic rift system. This change in the drainage direction decreased the distance to the marine base level by approximately 1,000 km, which in turn decreased the average topographic elevation in the Molasse Basin by at least 200 m. Isostatic adjustment to erosional unloading required ca. 1,000 m of erosion to account for this inferred topographic lowering. A further inference is that the resulting increase in the sediment discharge at the Miocene– Pliocene boundary reflects the recycling of Molasse units. We consider that erosion of the Molasse Basin occurred in response to a shift in the drainage direction rather than because of a change in paleoclimate. Climate left an imprint on the Alpine landscape, but presumably not before the beginning of glaciation at the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary. Similar to the northern Alpine foreland, we do not see a strong climatic fingerprint on the pattern or rates of exhumation of the External Massifs. In particular, the initiation and acceleration of imbrication and antiformal stacking of the foreland crust can be considered solely as a response to the convergence of Adria and Europe, irre- spective of erosion rates. However, the recycling of the Molasse deposits since 5 Ma and the associated reduction of the loads in the foreland could have activated basement thrusts beneath the Molasse Basin in order to restore a critical wedge. In conclusion, we see the need for a more careful consideration of both tectonic and climatic forcing on the development of the Alps and the adjacent Molasse Basin.},

abstract = {The Eridanos fluvio-deltaic system, draining most of north-western Europe, developed during the Late Cenozoic as a result of simultaneous uplift of the Fennoscandian shield and accelerated subsidence in the North Sea Basin. This seismo-stratigraphic study aims to reconstruct the large-scale depositional architecture of the deltaic portion of the basin fill and relate it to external controls. A total of 27 units have been recognized. They comprise over 62�103�km3 in the Southern North Sea Basin alone, and have an average delta surface area of 28�103�km2, which suggests that the size of the drainage area was about 1.1�106�km2. Water depth in the depocentre is seen to decrease systematically over time. This trend is interrupted by a deepening phase between 6.5 and 4.5�Ma that can be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of increased uplift of the Fennoscandian shield, increased subsidence of the Southern North Sea Basin, and a long-term eustatic highstand. All these observations point to a tectonic control on long-term average rates of accommodation and supply. Controls on short-term variations are inferred from variations in rates of sediment supply and bifurcation of the delta channel network. Both rates were initially low under warm, moist, relatively stable climate conditions. The straight wave-dominated delta front gradually developed into a lobate fluvial-dominated delta front. Two high-amplitude sea-level falls affected the Pliocene units, which are characterized by widespread delta-front failures. Changes in relative sea level and climate became more frequent from the late Pliocene onward, as the system experienced the effects of glacial2013interglacial transitions. Peaks in sedimentation and bifurcation rates were coeval with cold (glacial) conditions. The positive correlation between rates of supply and bifurcation on the one hand, and climate proxies (pollen and 03B418O records) on the other hand is highly significant. The evidence presented in this study convincingly demonstrates the control of climate on time-averaged sediment supply and channel-network characteristics, despite the expected nonuniformity and time lags in system response. The presence of a clearly discernible climate signal in time-averaged sediment supply illustrates the usefulness of integrated seismo-stratigraphic studies for basin-wide analysis of delta evolution on geological time scales.},

abstract = {Abstract   Late Carboniferous (300–290 Ma) calc-alkaline basalts, andesites, and rhyolites typical of volcanic arc settings occur in
the intermontane Saar-Nahe basin (SW Germany) within the Variscan orogenic belt. The volcanic rock suite was emplaced under
a regime of tensional tectonics during orogenic collapse and its origin has been explained by melting of mantle and crust
in the course of limited lithospheric rifting. We report major, trace and rare-earth-element data (REE), and Nd-Pb-Sr-O isotope
ratios for a representative sample suite, which are fully consistent with an origin closely related to plate subduction. Major
and trace element data define continuous melt differentiation trends from a precursor basaltic magma involving fractional
crystallization of olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite typical of magma evolution in a volcanic arc. This finding
precludes an origin of the andesitic compositions by mixing of mafic and felsic melts as can be expected in anorogenic settings.
The mafic samples have high Mg numbers (Mg# = 65–73), and high Cr (up to 330 ppm) and Ni (up to 200 ppm) contents indicating
derivation from a primitive parental melt that was formed in equilibrium with mantle peridotite. We interpret the geochemical
characteristics of the near-primary basalts as reflecting their mantle source. The volcanic rocks are characterized by enrichment
in the large ion lithophile elements (LILE), negative Nb and Ti, and positive Pb anomalies relative to the neighboring REE,
suggesting melting of a subduction-modified mantle. Initial Nd values of −0.7 to −4.6, Pb, and 87Sr/86Sr(t) isotope ratios for mafic and felsic volcanics are similar and indicate partial melting of an isotopically heterogeneous and
enriched mantle reservoir. The enrichment in incompatible trace elements and radiogenic isotopes of a precursor depleted mantle
may be attributed to addition of an old sedimentary component. The geochemical characteristics of the Saar-Nahe volcanic rocks
are distinct from typical post-collisional rock suites and they may be interpreted as geochemical evidence for ongoing plate
subduction at the margin of the Variscan orogenic belt not obvious from the regional geologic context.},

Mineral and microstructural data indicate minimum temperatures of 200-250{degrees}C. CISillite 001 values of 0.45-0.61 ({Delta} {degrees}2{theta}) and insignificant amounts of smectite indicate a late diagenetic grade for illite pointing to temperatures <200{degrees}C. Chlorite, mainly formed in veins and cleavage planes, has CISchlorite 002 values between 0.35 and 0.26 ({Delta} {degrees}2{theta}) which only in part point to anchizonal grade. In contrast to these illite and chlorite data, maximum temperatures up to 370{degrees}C can be expected based on comparison with recently published fluid inclusion and mineral thermometric data. Illite is neither significantly affected by the hydrothermal event nor by deformation, and mirrors the burial history of the Wurm syncline. Chlorite grew syntectonically as is shown by bent and predominantly stretched sheets which do not, however, have deformed structures. Syntectonic hydrothermal growth by incipient nucleation along crystal edges limited domain size and thus also the CISchlorite 002 values. The hydrothermal event did not last long enough to allow further crystal growth. The retarded CISillite and CISchlorite grades can be best explained by limited duration (probably <5000 y) of the hydrothermal event which for a short time reached epithermal temperatures. The hydrothermal fluid flow was caused by dewatering of sedimentary rocks during thrusting and tectonic thickening within the Variscan orogen and it was focused along the Aachen thrust which represents the frontal Variscan thrust.

abstract = {A 2D integrated finite difference model of coupled fluid flow and heat transfer is presented for an area in northern Switzerland where crystalline basement is overlain by a Mesozoic/Tertiary sedimentary sequence. In this region the geothermal field is characterized by a strongly positive heat flow density anomaly (> 150 mW m−2). The anomaly is centered above a recently discovered Permocarboniferous trough. Several possibilities to explain the anomaly (thermal disturbance in the mantle, cooling shallow intrusion, locally strong uplift/erosion, local contrasts in petrophysical properties) can be ruled on in the basis of model calculations. Ascending deep groundwater is favored as the mechanism creating the observed anomaly. Deep groundwater circulation was investigated in detail, especially to clarify the hydraulic role of the Permocarboniferous trough, by coupled thermo-hydraulic modeling. The model was calibrated to reproduce the data set of field measurements available to date. The following parameters were used: i) hydraulic potential of aquifers, ii) discharge rate and temperature of thermal springs, iii) surface heat flow density distribution, iv) subsurface temperature field (as constructed from drillhole data). The model so calibrated enables to delimit the depth range of deep groundwater circulation (∼ 8 km), and the derivation of mean permeabilites and Darcy velocities for various parts of the crystalline basement (on the average, 10−15 m2 and 10 mm/y, respectively, for the area studied).},

abstract = {We present a simplified version of a vitrinite maturation model, complete with sample spreadsheet, based on changes in vitrinite composition with time and temperature. The simplified model, called EASY%R[o], uses an Arrhenius first-order parallel-reaction approach with a distribution of activation energies. EASY%R[o] has been calibrated to a more rigorous model of vitrinite maturation based on the chemical properties of coal vitrinite. With EASY%R[o], a profile of vitrinite reflectance vs. time can be obtained for a given stratigraphic level if the time-temperature history for that level has been estimated. When applied to multiple stratigraphic levels, EASY%R[o] can be used to compute profiles of the percent of vitrinite reflectance with depth for comparison with borehol data and to optimize thermal history models. EASY%R[o] can be used for vitrinite reflectance values of 0.3 to 4.5%, and for heating rates ranging from those in the laboratory (1 degree C/week) to those in slowly subsiding geologic basins (1 degree C/10 m.y.). Examples of model applications range from sedimentary rocks heated by an igneous intrusion to a variety of burial histories. Vitrinite maturation predicted by EASY%Ro is compared to other methods currently being used, such as the Lopatin time-temperature index, level of organic maturity, and other approaches using a single activation energy. Our model successfully estimates vitrinite reflectance due to thermal metamorphism of sedimentary rocks heated by igneous intrusions, geothermal fluids, and burial in a variety of basin setting .},

Bull. 62, 1111–1148] examined various hypotheses regarding the origin of sea water and concluded that the most likely hypoth- esis was volcanic outgassing, a view that was generally accepted by earth scientists for the next several decades. More recent work suggests that the rate of subduction of water is much larger than the volcanic outgassing rate, lending support to hypotheses that either ocean volume has decreased with time, or that the imbal- ance is offset by continuous replenishment of water by cometary impacts. These alternatives are required in the absence of addi- tional mechanisms for the return of water from subducting litho- sphere to the Earth's surface. Our recent work on crustal perme- ability suggests a large capacity for water upflow through tectonically active continental crust, resulting in a heretofore unrecognized degassing pathway that can accommodate the wa- ter subduction rate. Escape of recycled water via delivery from the mantle through zones of active metamorphism eliminates the mass-balance argument for the loss of ocean volume or extrater- restrial sources.},

abstract = {Seismological models of upper-mantle structure are providing new constraints on the physical and chemical properties that differentiate the lithosphere from the asthenosphere. A wide variety of studies are consistent with an oceanic lithosphere that corresponds to a dry, chemically depleted layer over a hydrated, fertile asthenosphere. At the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath oceans and many Phanerozoic continental regions, observed seismic velocity gradients require a contrast in mantle hydration, fertility, and/or melt content, perhaps in combination with a vertical gradient in velocity anisotropy. Beneath cratons, evidence is growing for a deeper—but globally ubiquitous—asthenosphere. Some studies conclude that the cratonic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is gradual enough to be matched by a purely thermal gradient, whereas others indicate a more rapid transition and a contrast in composition or perhaps melt content.},

abstract = {A complex approach in characterisation of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) off south-eastern Sicily comprising applications of radioactive and non-radioactive tracers, direct seepage measurements, geophysical surveys and a numerical modelling is presented. SGD fluxes in the Donnalucata boat basin were estimated by direct seepage measurements to be from 4 to 12 L s-1, which are comparable with the total SGD flux in the basin of 17 L s-1 obtained from radon measurements. The integrated SGD flux over the Donnalucata coast estimated on the basis of Ra isotopes was around 60 m3 s-1 per km of the coast. Spatial variations of SGD were observed in the Donnalucata boat basin, the average 222Rn activity concentration in seawater varied from ???0.1 kBq m-3 to 3.7 kBq m-3 showing an inverse relationship with salinity. The continuous monitoring carried out at the site closest to the coast has revealed an inverse relationship of 222Rn activity concentration on the tide. The 222Rn concentrations in seawater varied from 2.3 kBq m-3 during high tides to 4.8 kBq m-3 during low tides, thus confirming an influence of the tide on submarine groundwater discharge. Stable isotopes (??2H and ??18O) showed that SGD samples consist up to 50% of groundwater. Geo-electrical measurements showed a spatial variability of the salt/fresh water interface and its complex transformation in the coastal zone. The presented results imply that in the studied Donnalucata site there are at least two different sources of SGD, one superficial, represented by mixed fresh water and seawater, and the second one which originates in a deeper limestone aquifer. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid explusion from geopressured sediments using a one-dimensional finite difference model shows that large volumes of fluid can be transported through a fractured seal during short-lived (textless100 year) expulsion events. In this model, abnormal fluid pressures are maintained by an impermeable seal. When the fluid pressure exceeds 85% of the lithostatic pressure, a vertical fracture opens in the seal, providing a permeable pathway from the geopressured sediments into the overlying section. Fluid pressure in the seal decreases as fluid flows through the fracture, closing the fracture as sediments in the seal compact. Once the fracture closes, the seal remains impermeable until fluid flowing from deeper in the section increases fluid pressure to the fracture criteria, a process that takes 10 000-500 000 years. Fractures emplaced in relatively incompressible seals, such as compacted and/or cemented sediments, remain open for 20-50 years; fluid fluxes through the seal integrated over the life of these events are 1-5107 kg/m2, and temperatures in the overlying sediments are increased by 5-20C. These temperature anomalies decay to less than half their original value in 300 years, suggesting that the thermal anomalies observed in wells that are attributed to fluid expulsion formed in response to a very recent or currently active event.},

abstract = {The first heat-flow and heat-production maps of the Iberian Peninsula and its margins using previously acquired data are presented. The surface heat-flow map includes 553 determinations carried out on water and mining exploration wells, oil exploration wells and on the seafloor. The surface heat flow varies noticeably from the Iberian mainland (65 +/- 10 mW m-2) to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean margins, where the heat flow reaches values of about 40-50 mW m-2 and 80-100 mW m-2, respectively. The heat-production map consists of 664 determinations carried out on rock samples from the Variscan Iberian Massif and the Betics. The higher values are obtained for granitic rocks (2.5-3.5 [mu]W m-3), whereas metasediments and basic rocks reach values of 1-2.5 [mu]W m-3 and nearly zero, respectively. The lithospheric structure deduced for the Iberian Peninsula by combining heat-flow, heat-production and elevation data indicates that most of the Iberian mainland is characterized by a lithospheric thickness of 110 +/- 5 km. This value is maintained across the West Atlantic margin, whereas towards the Mediterranean margin, the lithospheric thickness decreases down to 60-40 km. This study also suggests that the heat production in the southern Variscan Iberian Massif must be noticeably higher (3.7 +/- 0.5 [mu]W m-3) than in the rest of the areas in order to fit the measured heat-flow, crustal thickness and elevation data.},

annote = {A methodology is presented for the prediction of fission-track parameters in geological situations from a laboratory-based description of annealing kinetics. To test the validity of extrapolation from laboratory to geological timescales, the approach is applied to a number of geological situations for which apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA) data are available and where thermal history is known with some confidence. Predicted fission-track parameters agree well with observation in all cases, giving confidence in the validity of the extrapolation, and suggesting that fission-track annealing takes place by a single pathway in both laboratory and geological conditions. The precision of predicted track lengths is considered in some detail. Typical levels of precision are \textasciitilde �0.5 [mu]m for mean lengths [precedes, approximate] 10 [mu]m, and \textasciitilde �0.3 [mu]m for length [greater, approximate] 10 [mu]m. Precision is largely independent of thermal history for any reasonable geological thermal history. Accuracy of prediction is limited principally by the effect of apatite composition on annealing kinetics. The development of fission-track parameters is illustrated through a series of notional thermal histories to emphasise various key aspects of the response of the system. Temperature dominates over time in determining final fission-track parameters, with an order of magnitude increase in time being equivalent to a \textasciitilde 10�C increase in temperature. The final length of a track is determined predominantly by the maximum temperature to which it is subjected. Aspects of AFTA response are further highlighted by prediction of patterns of AFTA parameters as a function of depth and temperature from a series of notional burial histories embodying a variety of thermal history styles. The quantitative understanding of AFTA response not only affords the basis of rigorous paleotemperature estimation, but also allows a better understanding of the situations in which AFTA can be applied to yield useful information.},

abstract = {To provide a better understanding of sedimentary basin geological history, it is important to describe correctly the evolution of the various physical, mechanical and hydraulic properties of clayey rocks as a function of burial depth. As a contribution to this field, a programme of experimental studies on reworked clay samples compacted under various load pressures in oedometric conditions has been set up. The evolution of samples under compaction was followed with microscopic and macroscopic measurements. In a specially designed oedometric cell, samples are compacted under different total stresses from 0.1 to 50 MPa. In this cell, cylindrical cores are submitted to progressive loading from both ends under controlled pore pressure conditions. The symmetrical loading allows more even deformation about the midplane of the sample. This device allows the evolution of hydraulic pressure, radial stress, displacement and expelled pore fluid to be followed as a function of time. In a first step, kaolinite was chosen because it retains a high permeability (compared with other clays such as illite or smectite), which allows compaction tests to be performed within a few days. A complete set of measurements was performed after the tests. These measurements are: (1) micro-structures investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), mercury porosimetry, water removal under low water vapour pressure, granulometry and specific area measured by ethylene glycol adsorption; and (2) various physical parameters measured including hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity. TEM gives an understanding of the arrangement of particles. It was found that each particle is composed of several crystal units, each unit formed by ≈25 individual kaolinite layers. During compaction, these particles remain undeformed, but are rotated. The angular distribution of grain orientation is a function of the applied effective stress. This reorientation is in agreement with the observed decrease in porosity and pore size. It also explains the occurrence of a strong anisotropy in the thermal conductivity and hydraulic permeability. The combination of these experimental results allows a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the behaviour of kaolinite with respect to parameters such as permeability, porosity, mechanical and thermal properties, the knowledge of which are necessary for basin modelling.},

abstract = {The equilibrium form of the fluvial long profile has been used to elucidate a wide range of aspects of landscape history including tectonic activity in tectonic collision zones, and in continental margin and other intraplate settings, as well as other base-level changes such as due to sealevel fluctuations. The Hack SL form of the long profile, which describes a straight line on a log–normal plot of elevation (normal) versus distance (logarithmic), is the equilib- rium long profile form that has been most widely used in such studies; slope–area analysis has also been used in recent years. We show that the SL form is a special case of a more general form of the equilibrium long profile (here called the DS form) that can be derived from the power relationship between stream discharge and downstream distance, and the dependence of stream incision on stream power. The DS form provides a better fit than the SL form to river long profiles in an intraplate setting in southeastern Australia experiencing low rates of denudation and mild surface uplift. We conclude that, if an a priori form of the long profile is to be used for investigations of regional landscape history, the DS form is preferable. In particular, the DS form in principle enables equilibrium steepening due to an increase in channel substrate lithological resistance (parallel shift in the DS plot) to be distinguished from disequilibrium steepening due to long profile rejuvenation (disordered outliers on the DS plot). Slope–area analysis and the slope–distance (DS) approach outlined here are complementary approaches, reflecting the close relationship between downstream distance and downstream catchment area.},

abstract = {We investigate in this paper the possible origin of the high heat flow anomaly observed in the Massif Central (100-110 mW m-2). A detailed study of crustal heat production shows that the radioactive component cannot account for the entire surface anomaly. However, when we remove the integrated radioactive contribution from the surface heat flow, it appears that the anomaly is reduced to a smaller area close to the Cenozoic graben and the volcanic area, with an amplitude of 25-30 mW m-2. This mantle heat flow anomaly is interpreted as a transient component related to a mantle diapir ascent in the Massif Central since the Oligocene, also outlined by several other geological and geophysical studies. A kinematic model of thermal diapir in the mantle can explain this transient anomaly as well as other independent sets of data (gravity anomaly, topography, lithospheric thickness, partial melting) provided the vertical velocity of the ascent is 1 cm yr-1, the width of the diapir 40 km and the depth where it initiates 150 km.},

The imagery, combined with shallow core, deep borehole, and two-dimensional seismic reflection data, shows a marked asymmetry in the bedrock outcrop and structural style, both across and along the axis of the basin. For example, the oldest synrift rocks crop out in a complex south-verging anticline along one margin, whereas more massively bedded younger rocks are folded into a simpler anticline at the other. Comparison of our observations with both recent analog modeling and a neighboring inverted basin highlights the importance of the mechanical properties of the basin stratigraphy in controlling the structural development.

abstract = {The new tomographic image of the mantle beneath the French Massif Central reaching a depth of 270 km is interpreted in terms of mantle temperature, considering effects of anharmonicity and anelasticity on seismic velocities as well as effects of mineral reactions, composition and partial melt. For every block of the tomographic model we calculate the absolute temperature required to fit the observed velocity perturbation, the average temperature of the tomographic layer being constrained by P-T estimates from mantle xenoliths and by surface heat flow. From the 3-D temperature distribution we estimate the topography of the thermal lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as well as 3-D distributions of density, absolute P- and S-velocities and seismic attenuation. The observed velocity perturbations in the mantle beneath the Massif Central can be explained nearly entirely by temperature variations. Temperatures approach the dry peridotite solidus in the depth range from 50 to 90 km just below Cenozoic volcanic areas, but no large-scale partial melting is required to fit the seismic observations. Model temperatures agree well with P-T estimates from mantle xenoliths and measured surface heat flow. Model-predicted seismic velocities, seismic attenuation and density fit well the observations from seismic refractions, surface waves and gravity. The model predicts a broad uplift of the thermal lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to a depth of 65-70 km with a 50-70 km wide band of stronger lithospheric thinning which crosses the main volcanic fields and strikes parallel to the direction of maximal compression in the crust. The Limagne Graben, which is the major rift structure of the Massif Central, has no clear expression in the topography of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Our interpretation suggests a mantle plume below the central and southern part of the Massif Central with a potential temperature which is about 150-200[degree sign]C higher than the average potential temperature of the upper mantle. The structure of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary provides evidence for a possible thinning of the mantle part of the lithosphere beneath the volcanic fields parallel to the direction of minimal horizontal compression in the crust.},

abstract = {The Adriatic region forms an intermediate continental foreland overthrust along its northeastern margin by the southwest vergent Dinaric thrust belt in Eocene-Oligocene time and along its southwestern margin by the northeast vergent Apennine thrust belt in Pliocene-Quaternary time. Orogenic activity within these thrust belts was accompanied by the development of two superposed foredeep basin systems of opposite polarity and different ages. Using well log, biostratigraphic, and seismostratigraphic data, the geometry of this composite basin system was reconstructed along three profiles at beginning of Quaternary, middle Pliocene, beginning Pliocene, and beginning Eocene time. Modeling of reconstructed geometries using a thin elastic sheet approximation yields a range of acceptable effective elastic plate thicknesses for the central Adriatic region of Te = 5–10 km for Eocene-Oligocene flexure and Te = 10–15 km for Pliocene-Quaternary flexure (although an upper bound for Te could not be established on one of the three profiles). These results are consistent with a constant effective elastic plate thickness of Te = 10 km for the Adriatic lithosphere and preclude the possibility that significant weakening of the Adriatic plate occurred between flexural events. Modeling of incremental deflections between Pliocene and Quaternary time gives results consistent with constant values of Te = 10 km in the central Adriatic and Te = 15 km in the northern Adriatic and Po Plain and shows little evidence for weakening of the plate during Pliocene-Quaternary time. Thus within the resolution of the data presented in this paper, there is little evidence for viscous relaxation of the lithosphere on time scales between about 2 and 50 m.y. Analysis of bending of an idealized lithosphere with a simple brittle-elastic-ductile rheology, and a low to moderate thermal gradient suggests that the small values of Te observed within the Adriatic region can be readily understood as the result of bending of the lithosphere to unusually high curvature (4 × 10−6 m−1) and do not require unusually high temperatures within the foreland lithosphere. The same rheological model is also consistent with the absence of significant inelastic yielding for at least 50 m.y. after the cessation of loading. An apparent unbending of the Adriatic lithosphere began in early Quaternary time, approximately coeval with the cessation of major thrusting within the Apennine thrust belt. The three-dimensional pattern of Quaternary deflection makes it difficult to attribute this phenomenon to local depositional processes and suggests that unbending reflects a fundamental change in the subduction process in early Quaternary time. Our preferred interpretation is that unbending is the result of a diminution of forces acting on the subducted Adriatic lithosphere at mantle depths.},

abstract = {Palaeo-heat flows and thicknesses of eroded Carboniferous overburden in the coal-bearing Ruhr basin (western Germany) were estimated using one-dimensional basin modelling techniques. Thermal and burial histories for 11 localities were calibrated by comparing measured and calculated vitrinite reflectance data, based on the assumption of pre-tectonic maturation. In contrast to former studies, the kinetic EASY%R0 approach applied for the calculation of vitrinite reflectance. Lopatin's TTI algorithm was used in addition for one well in order to demonstrate the impact of the selection of the algorithm for vitrinite reflectance calculation on the simulation results. Simulated palaeo-heat flows for the time of maximum burial (most probably in the Stephanian) range from 64 to 83 mW/m2 and decrease towards the south. These heat flows are lower than values computed during earlier studies, but are still relatively high in comparison to recent foreland basins. The regional distribution of palaeo-heat flows indicates that the crust beneath the Ruhr basin was relatively thin and thickened towards the south at the end of the Carboniferous. After the Stephanian, 2200-3500 m of Carboniferous overburden were eroded. An observed southward increase in eroded thicknesses is caused by an uplift of the area studied, which decreased towards the north, at the end of the Variscan folding. Large thicknesses of deposited (and later eroded) Carboniferous sediments have to be postulated to explain the maturity data even along the present southern margin of the Ruhr basin. This indicates that the late Carboniferous sediments originally extended far to the south. Geological arguments suggest that the deposition of Carboniferous sediments in the entire Ruhr basin continued until the Stephanian.},

abstract = {The Lower Saxony Basin (LSB) in NW Germany forms part of the Southern Permian Basin gas province in Central Europe. Commonly, methane-rich gas generated from Upper Carboniferous coal-bearing strata and accumulated in Permian sandstones and carbonates. In contrast, in the southwestern part of the LSB the gas composition in reservoirs can be very variable with respect to CO2 content which varies between 0 and up to 90% [1]. Locally, organic matter in Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks locally shows matury as high as 4.5% VRr. The area is characterized by a magnetic and a positive gravity anomaly which has been related to the Early Cretaceous igneous intrusion of the so-called Bramsche Massif. Therefore, a thermal influence of magmatic intrusion(s) in the southwestern part of the LSB has been favored. However, more recent studies focusing on numeric modeling suggest a model that includes deep burial during Early Cretaceous times followed by Late Cretaceous/Tertiary uplift and subsequent erosion of several thousands of meters of sedimentary rocks [2]. Fluid inclusions studies in hydrothermal minerals from wells and outcrops in the study area yield migration of differently composed fluids and gases during stages of burial and uplift. Migration of CH4-CO2 gas mixtures along fissures and veins occurred in the presence of saline brines at elevated pressure conditions during the Mesozoic. Similar saline brines were typically also traced in other parts of the Central European Basin [3]. Locally, the formation of Pb-Zn-(Ba-F) mineralization is related to the migration of these brines. In contrast, in the vicinity of supposed intrusion the migration of hot fluids (>200°C) is recorded in quartz mineralization that is hosted by Upper Carboniferous to Cretaceous sediments. The salinity of fluid inclusions is highly variable suggesting that different fluid reservoirs were drained. However, fluid entrapment often occurred along with the entrapment of gas mixtures with variable contents of CH4, CO2, and locally N2. These gas inclusions formed at pressure conditions close to hydrostatic most probably during basin inversion.},

abstract = {The properties of sandstones as potential reservoirs and shales as source rocks depend on primary facies relationships and diagenesis. Porostiy loss due to mechanical compation and pressure solution is essentially a function of grain parameters (sorting, packing and composition) and net overburden stress. The porosity loss can be predicted to a certain extent. The importance of secondary porosity caused by dissolution of framework grains and cements has been fully recognized. The discussion has focused on the processes causing such dissolution and to what extent it can cause net increase in porosity. The most critical factor in clastic diagenesis is the nature of porewater flow and the degree of mass transfer taking place as a result of this. In the North Sea reservoir rocks, petrographic and geochemical evidence suggest that most of the leaching of feldspar and mica resulting in the formation of kaolinite occurred early during fresh wather flushing. Recent calculations indicate that »acids« derived from source rocks are inadequate to explain the secondary porosity observed in reservoir rocks. Mathematical modelling suggests that thermal convection is of limited importance in sedimentary basins, except where there are high lateral changes in geothermal gradients. Evidence from porewater geochemistry suggests that porewaters in sedimentary basins are often stratified or compartmentalized in a way which is inconsistent with large scale convection or compactional flow, making it necessary to assume that diagenetic reactions are relatively isochemical during deeper burial. A better understanding of the diagenetic reactions will help us to improve our predictions about porosity/depth relations, pore size, and pore geometry distribution in reservoir rocks. Porosity depth trends from offshore Norway and published data from other basins are discussed. Empirical linear best fit lines are found to illustrate the relationship quite well for depths between one and five km. Within a specific region, the linear porosity gradient is a function of mineral composition and of temperature and pressure gradients. Primary porosity tends to be best preserved in sandstones with high proportions of stable grains (e. g. in quartz arenites) down to about 3 or 4 km. At greater depth, porosity loss is accelerated due to increased pressure solution. Secondary and primary porosity adjacent to feldspar grains then tends to be selectively preserved relative to primary pores between quartz grains.},

abstract = {Collecting and interpreting permeability data in karst systems is considered complicated due to three distinct properties of these systems. First, the distribution of high permeability features may be one-dimensional features difficult to detect with wells, or may be so high in the wells the upper measurement limit is encountered during aquifer testing. Secondly, turbulent flow may make the application of continuum hydraulic principles difficult. Finally, permeability in these systems commonly increases with the scale of measurement. The aquifer for Sete Lagoas, Brazil, was used to evaluate a permeability combination methodology testing the permeability structure across a range of spatial scales in order to develop a quantitative model of hydraulically active features consistent across all scales of measurement, from matrix properties to regional-scale flow. The aquifer in this study has some wells without measurable drawdown during pumping due to high permeability. Data indicated an increase in permeability from the small- to the well-scale and a decrease from the well- to regional-scale due to the localized development of a karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally controlled region of the aquifer. The matrix permeability in the region is very low and the secondary porosity is mostly filled by secondary precipitation of calcite. Based on measurement technique, the permeability data vary over many orders of magnitude, while the physical size of permeable features of the aquifer are consistent across the scales of data collection. The geometry provides a quantitative understanding of the scale effects of permeability measurements.},

abstract = {Recent work has suggested that weathering processes occurring in the subsurface produce the majority of silicate weathering products discharged to the world's oceans, thereby exerting a primary control on global temperature via the well-known positive feedback between silicate weathering and CO2. In addition, chemical and physical weathering processes deep within the critical zone create aquifers and control groundwater chemistry, watershed geometry and regolith formation rates. Despite this, most weathering studies are restricted to the shallow critical zone (e.g. soils, outcrops). Here we investigate the chemical weathering, fracturing and geomorphology of the deep critical zone in the Bisley watershed in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico, from two boreholes drilled to 37.2 and 27.0 m depth, from which continuous core samples were taken. Corestones exposed aboveground were also sampled. Weathered rinds developed on exposed corestones and along fracture surfaces on subsurface rocks slough off of exposed corestones once rinds attain a thickness up to $\sim$1 cm, preventing the corestones from rounding due to diffusion limitation. Such corestones at the land surface are assumed to be what remains after exhumation of similar, fractured bedrock pieces that were observed in the drilled cores between thick layers of regolith. Some of these subsurface corestones are massive and others are highly fractured, whereas aboveground corestones are generally massive with little to no apparent fracturing. Subsurface corestones are larger and less fractured in the borehole drilled on a road where it crosses a ridge compared with the borehole drilled where the road crosses the stream channel. Both borehole profiles indicate that the weathering zone extends to well below the stream channel in this upland catchment; hence weathering depth is not controlled by the stream level within the catchment and not all of the water in the watershed is discharged to the stream.

abstract = {Fluid flow simulation models of faulted reservoirs normally include faults as grid offset in combination with 2D transmissibility multipliers. This approach tends to oversimplify the way effects caused by the actual 3D architecture of fault zones are handled. By representing faults as 3D rock volumes in reservoir models, presently overlooked structural features may be included and potentially yield a more realistic description of structural heterogeneities. This paper investigates how a volumetric fault zone description, will affect fluid flow in simulation models.  An experimental 3D model grid including a single normal fault, defined as a volumetric grid, was constructed. Subsequently, the fault grid was populated with two conceptual fault deformation products - sand lenses and fault rock - using an object-based stochastic facies modelling technique. In order to evaluate the effect of varying petrophysical properties, fault rock permeability and sand lens permeability were varied deterministically between 0.01 mD and 1 mD and 50 mD and 500 mD, respectively. The impact of fault core architecture was investigated by deterministically varying sand lens fraction and sand lens connectivity. This yielded 24 model configurations, executed in 20 stochastic realizations each. Fluid flow simulation was performed on 480 model realizations.  Simulation results show that the most important parameters influencing fluid flow across the fault were fault rock matrix permeability, and whether or not the sand lenses were connected to the undeformed host rock. Sand lens permeability and sand lens fraction turned out to be less important for fluid flow than fault rock matrix permeability and sand lens connectivity.},

abstract = {The heat flow map of Europe was derived from 2605 existing observations, which for this purpose were supplemented by numerous results of deep borehole temperatures, gradients and local heat flow patterns. In areas without data the heat flow field was extrapolated on the basis of the regional tectonic structure and the observed correlation of heat flow and the age of the last tectono-thermal event. The heat flow pattern as obtained in the map may be described by two components: (i) regional part and (ii) local part of the measured surface geothermal activity. The regional part of the heat flow field in Europe is dominated on the whole by a general ‘north-east to south-west' increase of the geothermal activity, which is an obvious consequence of the tectonic evolution, the major heat flow provinces corresponding thus to the principal tectonic units. The geothermal fine structure (local part) superimposing the former is mainly controlled by local tectonics, especially by the distribution of the deep reaching fracture zones and by the hydrogeological parameters. The correlation between the heat flow pattern and the crustal structure allows some preliminary geophysical implications: (a) areas of the increased seismicity may be connected with the zones of high horizontal temperature gradient, (b) increased surface heat flow may be generally observed in the zones of weakened crustal thickness, (c) there are considerable regional variations in the calculated temperature on the Moho-discontinuity, as well as in the upper mantle heat flow contribution.},

It is the source of about 40 percent of the water used for all purposes exclusive of hydropower generation and electric powerplant cooling. Surprisingly, for a resource that is so widely used and so important to the health and to the economy of the country, the occurrence of ground water is not only poorly understood but is also, in fact, the subject of many widespread misconceptions . Common misconceptions in- clude the belief that ground water occurs in underground rivers resembling surface streams whose presence can be detected by certain individuals . These misconceptions and others main points covered in the text . Because the text is, in effect, an expanded discussion of the il- lustrations, most of the illustrations are not captioned. However, where more than one draw- ing is included in a section, each drawing is assigned a number, given in parentheses, and these numbers are inserted at places in the text where the reader should refer to the drawing. In accordance with U.S . Geological Survey policy to encourage the use of metric units, have hampered the development and conservation of ground water and have adversely af- fected the protection of its quality . In order for the Nation to receive maximum benefit from its ground-water resource, it is essential that everyone, from the rural homeowner to managers of industrial and municipal water supplies to heads of Federal and State water-regulatory agencies, become more knowledgeable about the occurrence, development, and protection of ground water. This report has been prepared to help meet the needs of these groups, as well as the needs of hydrologists, well drillers, and others engaged in the study and development of ground-water supplies . It consists of 45 sections on the basic elements of ground-water hydrology, arranged in order from the most basic aspects of the subject through a discussion of the methods used to determine the yield of aquifers to a discussion of common problems encountered in the operation of ground-water supplies . Each section consists of a brief text and one or more drawings or maps that illustrate the PREFACE Ground water is one of the Nation's most valuable natural resources.},

abstract = {A retrograde sequence of fluid-controlled, low-temperature mineral reactions has been preserved along an east-west striking, dextral-oblique-slip fault in the uplifted Rhine Graben shoulder. This fault (the Schauenburg Fault, near Heidelberg), juxtaposes Permian rhyolite against Carboniferous (Variscan) granite and shows syn- or post-rift displacement of the north–south trending, eastern boundary fault of the rift basin. Both mineral texture and rock fabric indicate that the fault forms a site of high rock permeability and fluid flow, and records the exhumation and fluid-rock history of the rift shoulder since the Mesozoic. The reaction sequence and mineral compositions of the clay minerals within the cataclasite, and adjacent granite and rhyolite lithologies, document progressively decreasing fluid temperatures, with back-reactions of pure 2M1 illite to 1Md (R3) illite-smectite, and eventually smectite and kaolinite assemblages. Compositional variations are attributed to Tertiary to Recent fluid flushing of the fault zone associated with rift flank uplift, and with progressive dilution of the electrolyte-rich, acidic to neutral hydrothermal brines by down-flowing electrolyte-poor, meteoric waters.},

The geometry, a single fracture in a 21) matrix, was chosen in order to better understand the relevant processes for the long term behaviour of HDR reservoir. Linear elastic effects of temperature and pore pressure perturbations on stress in the solid matrix are assumed as well as a non-linear joint closure law. Thermal transport by both conduction and advection is included in the fracture and the matrix. The results of these models highlight the importance of the coupled hydraulic thermal and mechanical processes on long term system behaviour.},

abstract = {We propose an accurate, fast and easy-to-use method to derive numerical solutions for production–diffusion equations for finite diffusion domains of various shapes and arbitrary cooling histories. Previous studies provide solutions for spheres, infinite cylinders and infinite sheets. We extend this range and provide solutions for finite bodies, i.e. finite cylinders and rectangular blocks of any aspect ratio. This approach is important as recently, it has become clear that, for example, the physical grain is the diffusion domain for He diffusion in apatite and titanite [J. Geophys. Res. 105 (2000) 2903; Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 63 (1999) 3845]. We discuss the use of the new approach for forward modelling (U–Th)/He production–diffusion in apatite. Taking results with finite cylinders as a good approximation for apatite crystals, it is found that approximating instead with spheres or infinite cylinders having the same radius yields differences in calculated ages that can easily be as large as 20–35%. The relative differences are most pronounced in thermal histories that spend significant time at or near the closure temperature. On the other hand, reasonable agreement is found with spheres having the same surface to volume ratio. D},

abstract = {Extensive calcite fault cement has resulted from leakage of Santa Barbara basin fluids and hydrocarbons into the Refugio-Carneros fault, a north-bounding structure to the basin. Calcite cements are only found at the end segments of the 24-km (15-mi)-long fault zone, which has less than 150 m (490 ft) of maximum normal offset. The calcite is contemporaneous with fault movement, as evidenced by pervasive crystal twinning and brecciation, as well as textures indicating repeated episodes of rapid fluid flow and calcite cementation. Based on U-Th dates of the calcite, fluid flow along the fault occurred between 110 and greater than 500 ka, indicating that fluid migration was intermittently active during the recent uplift history of the basin flank. Stable carbon isotopic values of the calcite are {delta}13CPDB = -35 to -41{per thousand}, which means that the carbon source is predominantly thermogenic methane. The composition of fluid inclusions in calcite is consistent with mixing of meteoric and saline water in the presence of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. Fluid-inclusion homogenization temperatures of about 80-95{degrees}C suggest that hot water leaked from 2- to 3-km (1.2- to 1.9-mi) depths in the basin and moved up faults on the basin flank at rates rapid enough to transport substantial heat to shallow depths. Finite-element models show that, in this case, this process requires faulting of an overpressured basin and that a single flow event would have lasted for at least 103 yr.  Subsurface fluid pressures at comparable depths in the offshore section today are close to hydrostatic, and therefore, only slow hydrocarbon seepage occurs. When combined with the U-Th age data, this suggests that over a 105-yr timescale, basin fluid flow has evolved from the rapid expulsion of hot water and gas being carried up along active, bounding faults derived from overpressured strata to present hydrostatic conditions of slow, buoyancy-driven seepage of hydrocarbons.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of fault hydraulic architecture, based on &#62;700 spatially distributed ground and geothermal spring temperature measurements taken in an active fault zone. Geostatistical simulations were used to extrapolate the measured data over an 800 &#215; 100 m area and develop a high-resolution image of temperatures in the fault. On the basis of the modeled temperatures, a simple analytical model of convective heat transport was used to infer a probability distribution function for hydraulic conductivities in a two-dimensional plane parallel to the land surface, and the partitioning of flow between flow paths of different conductivities was calculated as a fraction of the total flux. The analysis demonstrates the existence of spatially discrete, high-permeability flow paths within the predominantly lower-permeability fault materials. Although the existence of fast-flow paths in faults has been hypothesized for &#62;10 yr, their prevalence and contribution to the total flow of fluid in a fault zone are debated. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the flux transmitted by an individual fast-flow path is significantly greater than that of an average flow path, but the total flux transported in fast-flow paths is a negligible fraction of the total flux transmitted by the fault.},

We present the results of forward modelling of the Northern Alpine German-Austrian Molasse Basin, which forms part of the Northern Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB) extending from Lake Geneva in the west to Lower Austria in the east. The observed deflection of the European plate under the NAFB has been modelled along five profiles perpendicular to the basin axis. Models treating the deflection of the NAFB as a flexural response to loading only, require a set of loading parameters (bending moment, vertical force) which would imply bending stresses exceeding the strength of the subsiding plate. Moreover, this approach would not take into account the significant post-Molasse uplift experienced by the Alpine chain and its northern foreland basins. We modelled the deflection as the response to two distinct processes: (1) flexure of an elastic plate with lateral variations (EET-values of 7-26 km from east to west) loaded with surface and limited subsurface loads and (2) the Late Cenozoic (post-molasse) phase of 'unflexing', significant uplift observed in the Alps and its northern foreland. Our study provides a first attempt to separate these two processes in order to model the deflection by an elastic plate-model, adopting flexural parameters that will not exceed the strength of the lithosphere.},

Temperature data are available typically from only a section of the depth interval making 2D contouring of the temperature field difficult. Surface temperature values were used in calculations of the thermal gradient. The quality of the BHT data deteriorates towards the shallow part of the basin where larger errors of heat-flow estimates of the profile are calculated. Estimated heat flow increases from the southwest towards the northeast. Anomalously high values between 300 km – 500 km of the profile are questionable. Thermal gradient values based on BHTs and resulting estimates of heat flow have been compared with calculated thermal gradient and heat flow from 2D steady-state models of coupled fluid flow/heat flow in saturated porous media along the profile for 5 situations of hydraulic conductivity in the major aquifers. The results of this comparison show that, for uniform basement heat flow (assumed 70 mW/m 2 ), it is difficult to explain simultaneously the observed heat flow lows and highs by the same fluid-flow system within the range of acceptable permeabilities. Other possible explanations of high thermal gradients based on BHTs in the shallow part of the basin need to be sought. It has been determined that the effective thermal conductivity can be a partial explanation especially if the influence of compaction of the shales is considered. An alternative explanation is the systematic overestimate of temperature by BHTs in the shallow northeastern part of the basin. The comparison of the shallow basin temperature data with high-precision temperature measurements in two areas in the shallow part of the basin shows that the industrial temperatures tend to be systematically higher. This disagreement is interpreted to be a result of the systematic error in shallow BHT's. The validity of thousands of industrial BHT's from shallow depths (from 500 to 900 m) documenting the regional thermal high is in question. This observation calls for reevaluation of thermal gradient maps based on BHTs only; especially in the shallow part of the basin towards the shield where anomalously high thermal gradients (>40 mK/m) have been reported previously. Precise temperature measurements in three sites in the shallow part of the basin and the geothermal gradient map based on shut-in well temperatures in oil pools show that the change from low gradients in the Foothills (<25mK/m) to highs in the foreland basin (>35mK/m) takes place over the horizontal distance of less than 300 km and the latter change can be explained easier by the hydrodynamic heat flow coupled system based on a 2D model.},

abstract = {Ground water of both terrestrial and marine origin flows into coastal surface waters as submarine groundwater discharge, and constitutes an important source of nutrients, contaminants and trace elements to the coastal ocean. Large saline discharges have been observed by direct measurements and inferred from geochemical tracers, but sufficient seawater inflow has not been observed to balance this outflow. Geochemical tracers also suggest a time lag between changes in submarine groundwater discharge rates and the seasonal oscillations of inland recharge that drive groundwater flow towards the coast. Here we use measurements of hydraulic gradients and offshore fluxes taken at Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, together with a modelling study of a generalized coastal groundwater system to show that a shift in the freshwater-saltwater interface-controlled by seasonal changes in water table elevation-can explain large saline discharges that lag inland recharge cycles. We find that sea water is drawn into aquifers as the freshwater-saltwater interface moves landward during winter, and discharges back into coastal waters as the interface moves seaward in summer. Our results demonstrate the connection between the seasonal hydrologic cycle inland and the saline groundwater system in coastal aquifers, and suggest a potentially important seasonality in the chemical loading of coastal waters.},

abstract = {Although studies of free convection commonly focus on highly permeable strata, but numerical analyses indicate that density-driven free convection may also occur in heterogeneous low-permeability strata. Traditional Rayleigh number criteria are overly conservative in predicting thermohaline convection in these systems; so, numerical models are used to make inferences on the process. Simulations with stochastic realizations of permeability fields show that dense plumes can take preferential pathways to sink through generally low-permeability strata; patch analysis using percolation theory shows that the threshold permeability for the onset of free convection can be as low as 10221216�m2 even with a mean permeability of 10221218�m2. Threshold permeability for the percolation pathways decreases with increasing concentration gradient, vertical correlation length and the mean and variance of the permeability. The connectedness of relatively high-permeability zones is important in initiating and controlling plume fingers of free convection in both single-layer and sand-shale sequence models. Permeable units above and below are conducive to free convection through intervening low-permeability strata if buoyancy gradients exist. This heterogeneity is on scales that are difficult to sample by drilling and too localized to be simulated in regional models but may be significant in solute transport in these systems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Throughout the world, nitrogen (N) losses from intensive agricultural production may end up as undesirably high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater with a long-term impact on groundwater quality. This has human and environmental health consequences, due to the use of groundwater as a drinking water resource, and causes eutrophication of groundwater-dependent ecosystems such as wetlands, rivers and near-coastal areas. At national scale, the measured nitrate concentrations and trends in Danish oxic groundwater in the last 70 years correlate well with the annual agricultural N surpluses. We also show that the N use efficiency of agriculture is related to the groundwater nitrate concentrations. We demonstrate an inverted U-shape of annual nitrate concentrations as a function of economic growth from 1948 to 2014. Our analyses evidence a clear trend of a reversal at the beginning of the 1980s towards a more sustainable agricultural N management. This appears to be primarily driven by societal demand for groundwater protection linked to economic prosperity and an increased environmental awareness. However, the environmental and human health thresholds are still exceeded in many locations. Groundwater protection is of fundamental global importance, and this calls for further development of environmentally and economically sustainable N management in agriculture worldwide.},

The partitioning of evapotranspiration into bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration remains a key uncertainty in the terrestrial water balance.We used integrated hydrologic simulations that couple vegetation and land-energy processes with surface and subsurface hydrology to study transpiration partitioning at the continental scale. Both latent heat flux and partitioning are connected to water table depth, and including lateral groundwater flow in the model increases transpiration partitioning from 47 ± 13 to 62 ± 12%.This suggests that lateral groundwater flow, which is generally simplified or excluded in Earth system models, may provide a missing link for reconciling observations and global models of terrestrial water water fluxes.},

abstract = {Direct evidence that channel flow of aqueous fluids accompanies shallow crustal faulting, in some instances at least, comes from the observation of transitory surface effusions following some moderate to large earthquakes in consolidated rocks, and the textural characteristics of the hydrothermal vein systems often found associated with ancient, exhumed faults. These phenomena are examined in relation to two alternative models. In the first, the transitory post-seismic flow results from the collapse of pre-failure dilatant fractures in accordance with the dilatancy/fluid-diffusion hypothesis, so that the fault system can be regarded as a ‘pump'. In the second model, the fault/fracture system functions as a ‘valve' on a fluid reservoir. Rising fluid pressure induces fault slip, creating a temporary fracture permeability which allows partial draining of the reservoir. As the fluid pressure drops, self-sealing of the fracture system occurs by deposition of hydrothermal minerals, and the whole cycle can then be repeated. In some instances there is convincing evidence that extensive fracture dilatancy has developed close in to faults (usually of normal dip-slip character), and that dilatancy pumping has occurred as a result of post-slip collapse of these fracture systems. Dilatant extension fractures can only form or re-open by hydraulic fracturing adjacent to faults provided they retain some cohesive strength, but an important upper limit is thereby placed on the permissible level of differential stress. The more frequent and intense development of extension vein arrays adjacent to normal faults in comparison with thrusts is in accord with theory, which suggests that hydraulic fracturing should occur at significantly lower fluid pressures around the former than the latter.},

The fault zone does not contain macroscopic fractures; the basic structural element is the deformation band. The fault core is composed of foliated clay flanked by structurally and lithologically heterogeneous mixed zones, in turn flanked by damage zones. Structures present within these fault-zone architectural elements are different from those in brittle faults formed in lithified sedimentary and crystalline rocks that do contain fractures. These differences are reflected in the permeability structure of the Sand Hill fault. Equivalent permeability calculations indicate that large-displacement faults in poorly lithified sediments have little potential to act as vertical-flow conduits and have a much greater effect on horizontal flow than faults with fractures.},

abstract = {A critique review of the state of quantitative basin modeling is presented. Over the last 15 years, a number of models are proposed to advance our understanding of basin evolution. However, as of present, most basin models are two dimensional (2-D) and subject to significant simplifications such as depth- or effective stress-dependent porosity, no stress calculations, isotropic fracture permeability, etc. In this paper, promising areas for future development are identified. The use of extensive data sets to calibrate basin models requires a comprehensive reaction, transport, mechanical (RTM) model in order to generate the synthetic response. An automated approach to integrate comprehensive basin modeling and seismic, well-log and other type of data is suggested. The approach takes advantage of comprehensive RTM basin modeling to complete an algorithm based on information theory that places basin modeling on a rigorous foundation. Incompleteness in a model can self-consistently be compensated for by an increase in the amount of observed data used. The method can be used to calibrate the transport, mechanical, or other laws underlying the model. As the procedure is fully automated, the predictions can be continuously updated as new observed data become available. Finally, the procedure makes it possible to augment the model itself as new processes are added in a way that is dictated by the available data. In summary, the automated data/model integration places basin simulation in a novel context of informatics that allows for data to be used to minimize and assess risk in the prediction of reservoir location and characteristics.},

abstract = {A well-established event of intraplate basin inversion and basement thrusting affected central Europe in Late Cretaceous time. It is widely accepted to have resulted from the collision of the Alpine orogen with Europe's margin. At that time an early Alpine orogen, located on the leading edge of the Adria microplate, still lay far southeast of its present-day position and had entered a phase of extension after a first orogenic event characterized by W- to NW-directed thrusting. This configuration is not likely to have induced SSW-NNE-directed thrusting and folding in the future European foreland that was still separated from the Alpine wedge by a strip of oceanic lithosphere. By contrast, the onset of intraplate contraction coincides with an important change in relative motion between the European and African plates. At ca. 90 Ma, Africa's SSE-directed sinistral transform motion relative to Europe changed to NE-directed convergence. This agrees well with the timing and kinematics of intraplate thrusting in central Europe. Structures of similar age and kinematics occurring in southern France, Spain, and North Africa suggest that the Late Cretaceous pulse of contraction was caused by pinching west-central Europe's thin lithosphere between Baltica and Africa. Only since the onset of N-directed thrusting in the Alps in Paleocene or Eocene time are the kinematics of the Alps and their European foreland compatible, indicating that mechanical coupling between Africa-Europe and the Adria microplate had been achieved.},

abstract = {Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation. It is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because $\rho$̇(t) does not depend only on $\rho$(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type $\rho$(t)=G(t, 0)$\rho$(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0 Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities. However, such equations often represent useful approximations.},

abstract = {The mathematical problem of steady groundwater flow toward a pumping well in an aquifer system consisting of layers (or aquifers) with anisotropy of the horizontal conductivity is solved analytically for the first time. The solution is an approximation for relatively weak anisotropy. If more than one layer is horizontally anisotropic, the method requires that the principal directions of anisotropy are the same in all layers. The presented solution is based on a first order perturbation technique. Comparison with numerical calculations shows a good agreement as long as Tmin is nowhere less than 0.6T max. Layers with stronger anisotropy are also allowed, provided these are embedded in a system with layers of weaker anisotropy.},

abstract = {Fault zone architecture and related permeability structures form primary controls on fluid flow in upper-crustal, brittle fault zones. We develop qualitative and quantitative schemes for evaluating fault-related permeability structures by using results of field investigations, laboratory permeability measurements, and numerical models of flow within and near fault zones. The qualitative scheme compares the percentage of the total fault zone width composed of fault core materials (e.g., anastomosing slip surfaces, clay-rich gouge, cataclasite, and fault breccias) to the percentage of subsidiary damage zone structures (e.g., kinematically related fracture sets, small faults, and veins). A more quantitative scheme is developed to define a set of indices that characterize fault zone architecture and spatial variability. The fault core and damage zone are distinct structural and hydrogeologic units that reflect the material properties and deformation conditions within a fault zone. Whether a fault zone will act as a conduit, barrier, or combined conduit-barrier system is controlled by the relative percentage of fault core and damage zone structures and the inherent variability in grain scale and fracture permeability. This paper outlines a framework for understanding, comparing, and correlating the fluid flow properties of fault zones in various geologic settings.},

abstract = {A detailed study of the structural and stratigraphic evolution of the Southern Permian Basin during latest Carboniferous to Early Jurassic times, supported by quantitative subsidence analyses and forward basin modelling for 25 wells, leads us to modify the conventional model for the Rotliegend–Zechstein development of this basin. The Late Permian–Early Jurassic tectonic subsidence curves are typical for a Permian to Early Triassic extensional stage that is followed by thermal subsidence. However, a purely extensional model is extremely problematic because active faulting during this time is ‘minor' and generally hard to document. Using inverse techniques to model the subsidence curves, we quantitatively show that a significant component of Late Permian and Triassic tectonic subsidence can be explained by thermal relaxation of Early Permian lithospheric thinning, and by delayed infilling of paleo-topographic depressions that developed during the Early Permian. In this interpretation, Stephanian–Autunian wrenching resulted in thermal destabilisation of the lithosphere, deep fracturing of the crust, disruption and erosion of its sedimentary cover and regional uplift of the area of the future Southern Permian Basin. Upon termination of wrench tectonics and associated volcanism, towards the end of the Autunian, the Southern Permian Basin began to subside in response to thermal contraction of the lithosphere. The evolving basin was isolated from the World oceans and had subsided possibly up to some 700 m below their level at the beginning of Upper Rotliegend sedimentation. After catastrophic flooding of this paleo-topographic depression at the beginning of the Zechstein, changing sea level, sedimentation and subsidence rates remained essentially in balance. Although the effects of Triassic rifting overprinted parts of the Southern Permian Basin, its overall subsidence pattern persisted well into the Jurassic. In contrast to the remainder of the Southern Permian Basin, Permian and Triassic crustal extension contributed significantly to the subsidence of the Polish Trough.},

abstract = {Inferered increases in 1981 to 1997 pumping records suggestthat by the year 2020, the majority of Nantucket Island municipal wellfields will be pumping near or at capacity. A sharp-interface model is used in this study to assess the impact of projected incerases in pumping from the Wyers Valley and proposed State Forest municipal wellfields on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. The model was first calibrated as part of a sensitivity study using a nine-year record of monthly water level data from a monitoring well network and salinity data from a deep borehole completed near the island's center. Best-fit values of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage obtained in the sensitivity analysis are in good agreement with those measured by single and multiple well aquifer tests across the island. The calibrated model was used to asses hydrological conditions across the island between 1997 and 2020 due to projected increases in municipal wellfield pumping. Transient simulation results suggest that salt water will invade the well screen of the deep (32m) Wyers Valley production well by the year 2014. Further, the width of the fresh water/salt water mixing zone under the municipal wellfields will triple by 2020 due to increasing seasonal fluctuations in pumping required to accomodate summer tourism. Using published etsimates of 2020 municpal wellfield pumping, wellhead delineation zones were also calculated using a variety of assumptins regarding the island's fresh water lens geometry (uniform, variable thickness with no upconing, variable thickness with upconing). Results indicate that the calculated delineation zones are most sensitive to island geometry, and to a lesser extent, to the fresh water lens thickness},

abstract = {An understanding of the processes of continental rifting is fundamental to understanding the evolution of the continents. Considerable evidence exists to suggest that continental rift zones are associated with high heat flow and elevated lithospheric geotherms, but direct heat-flow measurements from young rifts do not clearly define surface heat-flow anomalies associated with deep-seated thermal processes in these rifts. The first detailed compilation of heat-flow data from the Neogene Kenya rift is presented here. Heat-flow data are presented from traditional heat-flow determinations in water drill-holes, from bottom-hole-temperature measurements in oil wells, and from heat-flow estimates from groundwater silica data. These data define generally low heat flow on the flanks of the Kenya rift, with high, but variable heat flow on the rift floor. There is a spatial association among high heat-flow values, Quaternary volcanism and faulting, and hydrothermal manifestations on the rift floor. We interpret these results to suggest that any deep-seated thermal anomaly associated with the Kenya rift has not yet been conducted to the surface. The high heat-flow values are interpreted to result from heat advected into the axial rift zone with local redistribution of this heat by hydrothermal convection. Normal to moderately high heat flow was measured in eastern Kenya between the rift zone and the coast. The regional heat flow in eastern Kenya is interpreted to be normal, with local shallow modification by groundwater flow eastward from the Kenya dome. These interpretations support a model of relatively young evolution of the asthenospheric anomaly beneath the Kenya rift zone, with the age of heating of the mantle at the Mono no older than about 10 Ma.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional numerical reactive transport modeling was
    used to investigate the deposition of Pb-Zn-Cu ores in the Southeast
    Missouri district, central United States, by two potential mechanisms:
    cooling of a fluid carrying metals and reduced sulfur, and mixing of two
    fluids, one enriched in metals but poor in sulfur, and the other enriched in
    reduced sulfur but poor in metals. The mechanisms were studied within the
    context of the topography-driven ground-water flow regime established in the
    Ozark region by the Late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogeny. The models
    integrated geology, fluid flow, heat and solute transport, and chemical
    reaction, generating the most complete depiction yet of potential
    ore-forming processes in southeast Missouri.Both mechanisms were found capable of generating
    important characteristics of the mineralization patterns observed in the
    field but fell short in other respects. In models of the cooling hypothesis,
    mineralization was indeed found to be concentrated within the southeast
    Missouri portion of the Ozark region. This was primarily because of the fact
    that mineralizing fluid underwent very little temperature change as it
    traversed the Ozark region until it arrived in southeast Missouri, where its
    temperature decreased significantly. The important association of
    mineralization with local basement highs within the Southeast Missouri
    district was also produced, caused by local increases of fluid velocity over
    the crests of the basement highs. Smaller scale models, however, revealed
    much of the mineralization to be concentrated within the basal Lamotte
    Sandstone rather than the overlying Bonneterre Dolomite, where it is
    actually concentrated in the field. This model result stemmed directly from
    the fact that permeability and, therefore, fluid velocities were higher in
    the Lamotte than in the Bonneterre. A further discrepancy with field
    observations was the high predicted concentrations of quartz, which exceeded
    those of galena by over two orders of magnitude.Models of the mixing hypothesis also led to the regional
    concentration of mineralization in southeast Missouri, provided vertical
    dispersivities in the Lamotte Sandstone and Bonneterre Dolomite, the
    formations that transmitted the two different types of fluids, were low.
    When dispersivities were high, mineralization was produced more uniformly
    along the flow path. In further conformity with field observations, ore was
    concentrated in the Bonneterre Dolomite and particularly around the basement
    highs, demonstrating the importance of the Lamotte pinch-outs in causing the
    fluids to mix. The models reproduced well the observed vertical zonation in
    metals, which was controlled by the relative solubility differences among
    the primary sulfide ore minerals. However, though mixing was induced by the
    configuration of the local geology, its intensity was relatively low,
    leading to ore grades that were considerably less than would be expected
    from geochemical grounds alone. Because the flow regime is predominantly
    laminar, the two fluids tended to miscibly displace one another rather than
    vigorously mix with one another. While still potentially a viable
    ore-forming mechanism under conditions of high local dispersivity, high
    dissolved metal and sulfur concentrations, or high fluid velocity, the
    mixing hypothesis as typically formulated in southeast Missouri is
    nonetheless much less efficient than previously supposed. Greater efficiency
    could possibly be generated by reaction of aqueous species with solid phases
    in the matrix or gas (e.g., H2S) being generated in the matrix. },

abstract = {Basin model studies which have addressed the importance of smectite conversion to illite as a source of overpressure in the Gulf of Mexico have principally relied on a single-shale compaction model and treated the smectite reaction as only a fluid-source term. Recent fluid pressure interpretation and shale petrology studies indicate that conversion of bound water to mobile water, dissolution of load-bearing grains, and increased preferred orientation change the compaction properties of the shale. This results in substantial changes in effective stress and fluid pressure. The resulting fluid pressure can be 1500–3000 psi higher than pressures interpreted from models based on shallow compaction trends. Shale diagenesis changes the mineralogy, volume, and orientation of the load-bearing grains in the shale as well as the volume of bound water. This process creates a weaker (more compactable) grain framework. When these changes occur without fluid export from the shale, some of the stress is transferred from the grains onto the fluid. Observed relationships between shale density and calculated effective stress in Gulf of Mexico shelf wells confirm these changes in shale properties with depth. Further, the density–effective stress changes cannot be explained by fluid-expansion or fluid-source processes or by prediagenesis compaction, but are consistent with a dynamic diagenetic modification of the shale mineralogy, texture, and compaction properties during burial. These findings support the incorporation of diagenetic modification of compaction properties as part of the fluid pressure interpretation process.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal flow at oceanic spreading centres accounts for about ten per cent of all heat flux in the oceans and controls the thermal structure of young oceanic plates. It also influences ocean and crustal chemistry, provides a basis for chemosynthetic ecosystems, and has formed massive sulphide ore deposits throughout Earth's history. Despite this, how and under what conditions heat is extracted, in particular from the lower crust, remains largely unclear. Here we present high-resolution, whole-crust, two- and three-dimensional simulations of hydrothermal flow beneath fast-spreading ridges that predict the existence of two interacting flow components, controlled by different physical mechanisms, that merge above the melt lens to feed ridge-centred vent sites. Shallow on-axis flow structures develop owing to the thermodynamic properties of water, whereas deeper off-axis flow is strongly shaped by crustal permeability, particularly the brittle-ductile transition. About 60 per cent of the discharging fluid mass is replenished on-axis by warm (up to 300 degrees Celsius) recharge flow surrounding the hot thermal plumes, and the remaining 40 per cent or so occurs as colder and broader recharge up to several kilometres away from the axis that feeds hot (500-700 degrees Celsius) deep-rooted off-axis flow towards the ridge. Despite its lower contribution to the total mass flux, this deep off-axis flow carries about 70 per cent of the thermal energy released at the ridge axis. This combination of two flow components explains the seismically determined thermal structure of the crust and reconciles previously incompatible models favouring either shallower on-axis or deeper off-axis hydrothermal circulation.},

abstract = {Magnitudes of terrestrial (fresh) and marine (saline) sources of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) are estimated for a transect across Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Two independent techniques (seepage meters and pore water Cl− concentrations) show terrestrial SGD decreases linearly to around 22 m offshore, and these techniques, together with a model based on the width of the outflow face, indicate a cumulative discharge of between 0.02 and 0.9 m3/d per meter of shoreline. Seepage meters and models of the deficiencies in 222Rn activity in shallow sediments indicate marine SGD discharges of roughly 117 m3/d per meter of shoreline across the entire 1800-m-wide transect. Two surface streams nearest the transect have an average discharge of about 28 m3/d per meter of shoreline. Marine SGD is thus 4 times greater then surface water discharge and more than 2 orders of magnitude greater than terrestrial SGD. The magnitude of the terrestrial SGD is limited by the amount of regional precipitation, evaporation, recharge, and groundwater usage, while marine SGD is limited only by processes circulating marine water into and out of the sediments. The large magnitude of marine SGD means that it could be important for estuarine cycling of reactive components such as nutrients and metals with only slight modification from estuarine water compositions. The small magnitude of terrestrial SGD means that large differences from estuarine water composition would be required to affect chemical cycling.},

In its southwestern part, anomalously high maturity of organic matter has been observed to reach 4.5% VRr in Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in an area which coincides with a magnetic and a positive gravimetric anomaly. This anomaly was often interpreted as the consequence of a deep-seated igneous intrusion, the so-called Bramsche Massif. However, results obtained from calibrated numerical modelling are not in accordance with this scenario. Instead, a burial by approximately 4 km of now-eroded Cretaceous rocks was revealed to be the probable cause for the anomaly. Data and modelling results from six boreholes and two pseudo-wells support this view.},

abstract = {The dynamic behavior of magmatic hydrothermal systems entails coupled and nonlinear multiphase flow, heat and solute transport, and deformation in highly heterogeneous media. Thus, quantitative analysis of these systems depends mainly on numerical solution of coupled partial differential equations and complementary equations of state (EOS). The past 2 decades have seen steady growth of computational power and the development of numerical models that have eliminated or minimized the need for various simplifying assumptions. Considerable heuristic insight has been gained from process-oriented numerical modeling. Recent modeling efforts employing relatively complete EOS and accurate transport calculations have revealed dynamic behavior that was damped by linearized, less accurate models, including fluid property control of hydrothermal plume temperatures and three-dimensional geometries. Other recent modeling results have further elucidated the controlling role of permeability structure and revealed the potential for significant hydrothermally driven deformation. Key areas for future research include incorporation of accurate EOS for the complete H2O-NaCl-CO2 system, more realistic treatment of material heterogeneity in space and time, realistic description of large-scale relative permeability behavior, and intercode benchmarking comparisons.},

abstract = {Past studies of tectonically active mountain ranges have suggested strong coupling and feedbacks between climate, tectonics and topography. For example, rock uplift generates topographic relief, thereby enhancing precipitation, which focuses erosion and in turn influences rates and spatial patterns of further rock uplift. Although theoretical links between climate, erosion and uplift have received much attention, few studies have shown convincing correlations between observable indices of these processes on mountain-range scales. Here we show that strongly varying long-term (>10(6)-10(7) yr) erosion rates inferred from apatite (U-Th)/He cooling ages across the Cascades mountains of Washington state closely track modern mean annual precipitation rates. Erosion and precipitation rates vary over an order of magnitude across the range with maxima of 0.33 mm yr(-1) and 3.5 m yr(-1), respectively, with both maxima located 50 km west (windward) of the topographic crest of the range. These data demonstrate a strong coupling between precipitation and long-term erosion rates on the mountain-range scale. If the range is currently in topographic steady state, rock uplift on the west flank is three to ten times faster than elsewhere in the range, possibly in response to climatically focused erosion.},

abstract = {Natural fault damage zones are composed of clusters of sub-seismic-scale faults surrounding larger faults. In siliclastic rocks these faults often form partial barriers to flow and significantly influence fluid flow. A three-dimensional statistical model of fault damage zone architecture, incorporating fault size, orientation and spatial characteristics observed in natural examples, is used with a two-dimensional discrete fault flow model to investigate fluid flow and up-scaling of permeability in fault damage zones with a permeability contrast between rock matrix and fault rock of four orders of magnitude. Models that incorporate realistic fault orientation distributions show mean bulk permeabilities that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the rock matrix. Incorporating spatial clustering of smaller-scale faults around large faults results in a higher variance of bulk permeability. The degree of `efficiency' of 50 by 50 m faulted regions (spanning the fault damage zone) is characterized by comparing their bulk permeability with that of the same sized two-dimensional region with a single spanning fault of constant thickness such that the two areas contain the same proportion of fault rock. Regions of size 50 by 50 m are found to be around 50% efficient in the direction perpendicular to the main fault and between 1 and 10% efficient parallel to the main fault. The efficiency of the fault network, thus defined, was found to be insensitive to the exponent of the power law length distribution. This concept of fault damage zone efficiency and the modelling results provide a method of estimating bulk rock permeability from measurements of the fault rock proportion from core or bore-hole logs. Bulk fault zone permeability consists of contributions from the fault damage zone and the fault slip zone on which the majority of the displacement takes place. Estimates of the contribution of the slip zone suggest that the fault damage zone contributes significantly to the bulk permeability of the entire fault zone when slip zone fault rocks have permeabilities no lower than around one order of magnitude less than that of deformation bands. However, even when the slip zone dominates the fault zone bulk permeability, the fault damage zone is likely to have an important influence on flow processes, such as fault seal.},

Although some regional effects occur, the European Cenozoic continental climate record correlates well with the global oxygen isotope record from marine environments. During the last 45 million years, continental cooling is especially pronounced for inferred winter temperatures but hardly observable from summer temperatures. Correspondingly, Cenozoic cooling in Central Europe is directly associated with an increase of seasonality. In contrast, inferred Cenozoic mean annual precipitation remained relatively stable, indicating the importance of latent heat transport throughout the Cenozoic. Moreover, our data support the concept that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, although linked to climate changes, were not the major driving force of Cenozoic cooling.},

@article{Gudmundsson2003,
abstract = {It is proposed that the growth of fractures is the basic process for generating and maintaining permeability in solid rock (bedrock). Many extension fractures grow as hydrofractures, whereas many shear (and extension) fractures grow through the formation of transverse fractures that connect the adjacent tips of existing fractures. In a boundary-element analysis, the hydrofractures are modeled as being driven open by a fluid overpressure that varies linearly from 10 MPa at the fracture centre to 0 MPa at the fracture tip. The host rock has a uniform Young's modulus of 10 GPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.25, and is dissected by vertical joints and horizontal contacts, each of which is modeled as an internal spring of stiffness 6 MPa mm1. The number of joints and contacts, and their location with respect to the hydrofracture tip are varied in different model runs. The results of the analyses indicate that the tensile stresses generated by overpressured hydrofractures open up joints and contacts out to considerable distances from the fracture tip, so that they tend to link up to form a hydraulic pathway. Using the same Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and internal spring constant for joints as in the hydrofracture models, boundary-element models were made to study the interaction stresses that cause neighbouring joints to become interconnected through the growth of linking transverse fractures that, ultimately, may evolve into shear fractures. The models were subjected to tensile stress of 6 MPa acting normal to the joint planes as the only loading. The offset (horizontal distance) and underlap (vertical distance) between the adjacent tips of the joints were varied between model runs. The results show a concentration of tensile and shear stresses in the regions between the neighbouring tips of the joints, but these regions become smaller when the underlap of the joints decreases and changes to overlap. These stress-concentration regions favour the development of transverse (mostly shear) fractures that link up the nearby tips of the joints, so as to form a segmented shear or extension fracture. Analytical results on aperture variation of a hydrofracture in a homogeneous, isotropic rock are compared with boundary-element results for a hydrofracture dissecting layered rocks. The aperture is larger where the hydrofracture dissects soft (low Young's modulus) layers than where it dissects stiff layers. Aperture variation may encourage subsequent groundwater-flow channeling along a pathway generated by a hydrofracture in layered rocks.},

abstract = {More than 10,000 heat flow determinations exist for the earth and the data set is growing steadily at about 450 observations per year. If heat flow is considered as a surface expression of geothermal processes at depth, the analysis of the data set should reveal properties of those thermal processes. They do, but on a variety of scales. For this review heat flow maps are classified by 4 different horizontal scales of 10n km (n = 1, 2, 3 and 4) and attention is focussed on the interpretation of anomalies which appear with characteristic dimensions of 10(n - 1) km in the respective representations. The largest scale of 104 km encompasses heat flow on a global scale. Global heat loss is 4 x 1013 W and the process of sea floor spreading is the principal agent in delivering much of this heat to the surface. Correspondingly, active ocean ridge systems produce the most prominent heat flow anomalies at this scale with characteristic widths of 103 km. Shields, with similar dimensions, exhibit negative anomalies. The scale of 103 km includes continent wide displays. Heat flow patterns at this scale mimic tectonic units which have dimensions of a few times 102 km, although the thermal boundaries between these units are sometimes sharp. Heat flow anomalies at this scale also result from plate tectonic processes, and are associated with arc volcanism, back arc basins, hot spot traces, and continental rifting. There are major controversies about the extent to which these surface thermal provinces reflect upper mantle thermal conditions, and also about the origin and evolution of the thermal state of continental lithosphere. Beginning with map dimensions of 102 km thermal anomalies of scale 101 km, which have a definite crustal origin, become apparent. The origin may be tectonic, geologic, or hydrologic. Ten kilometers is a common wavelength of topographic relief which drives many groundwater flow systems producing thermal anomalies. The largest recognized continental geothermal systems have thermal anomalies 101 km wide and are capable of producing hundreds of megawatts of thermal energy. The smallest scale addressed in this paper is 101 km. Worldwide interest in exploiting geothermal systems has been responsible for a recent accumulation of heat flow data on the smallest of scales considered here. The exploration nature of the surveys involve 10's of drillholes and reveal thermal anomalies having widths of 100 km. These are almost certainly connected to surface and subsurface fluid discharge systems which, in spite of their restricted size, are typically delivering 10 MW of heat to the near surface environment.},

abstract = {Hydrologic changes associated with the 17 January 1995 Kobe Earthquake occurred in Awajishima Island very close to the epicenter. These included: (1) large drop of water table in the mountainous area; (2) rapid increase of discharge along active faults; and (3) change of chemistry of discharged water. A simple horizontal flow model was constructed to explain the observed changes; and optimal sets of specific yield and the change of hydraulic conductivity were estimated. Results suggest that this model can explain the observed phenomena consistently. The hydraulic conductivity is estimated to increase at least five times than that before the Earthquake; however, quantitative measurement of the increase of discharge just after the earthquake would constrain better the change of the hydraulic conductivity. The specific yield of the unconfined aquifer is between 0.3 and 1.7% depending on the assumed recharge rate but independent of the assumed depth to the impermeable basement. The change in chemical composition of the discharged water could be explained by the upward movement of deeper water due to the invasion of saltwater into the aquifer.},

abstract = {We have developed a procedure for estimating the effective elastic properties of various mixtures of smectite and kaolinite over a range of confining pressures, based on the individual effective elastic properties of pure porous smectite and kaolinite. Experimental data for the pure samples are used as input to various rock physics models, and the predictions are compared with experimental data for the mixed samples. We have evaluated three strategies for choosing the initial properties in various rock physics models: (1) input values have the same porosity, (2) input values have the same pressure, and (3) an average of (1) and (2). The best results are obtained when the elastic moduli of the two porous constituents are defined at the same pressure and when their volumetric fractions are adjusted based on different compaction rates with pressure. Furthermore, our strategy makes the modeling results less sensitive to the actual rock physics model. The method can help obtain the elastic properties of mixed unconsolidated clays as a function of mechanical compaction. The more common procedure for estimating effective elastic properties requires knowledge about volume fractions, elastic properties of individual constituents, and geometric details of the composition. However, these data are often uncertain, e.g., large variations in the mineral elastic properties of clays have been reported in the literature, which makes our procedure a viable alternative. },

Boundary conditions are inferred from indicative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of the last three glacial cycles to simulate groundwater flow related to ice sheet expansions into the.

Extreme high velocities may develop when the ice sheet has advanced to the southern margins of the upper Plio/Pleistocene aquifer in Northwest Europe.

abstract = {Conventional (porosity, permeability, grain density, residual oil and water saturation) and specialized (e.g., porosity and permeability under variable pressure) core petrophysical analyses have been compiled from information contained in well history reports for the Beaufort-Mackenzie region. Conventional data are available for 9302 core samples from Cenozoic (Paleocene-Miocene), Mesozoic (Jurassic, Cretaceous) and Paleozoic (Permian, Carboniferous, Devonian) successions in 112 wells (Appendix A); an additional 1115 specialized analyses are available for 24 wells (Appendix B). Well log data (density, sonic transit-time, resistivity, sonic and density caliper information) were obtained for the corresponding conventional core porosity measurements (Appendix C). The conventional analysis data are grouped in different combinations (depending on lithology, age, rock unit) and displayed in various histograms and cross plots (e.g., porosity-permeability, porosity-density, porosity-sonic transit-time). Significant data scatter is evident on all plots. Some sources for data scatter include: (1) variable rock composition and texture; (2) differences in measurement scales between logs and core samples; (3) borehole quality; (4) in situ stress conditions; (5) errors in depth between cores and logs; (6) sample quality (including alteration on sample recovery and measurement at surface conditions). Data scatter is reduced when grouping and plotting data by lithology, age and formation (factor 1 above), deleting anomalous points (associated with gas, gas hydrates, high shale and/or carbonate contents (factor 1)); and eliminating poor quality data from oversized boreholes based on caliper log data (factor 3). Samples from the Richards sequence (narrow depth range and few wells) show the significant effect of factors 1 and 2 on data scatter; porosity shows a higher variation than the log data. There is little or no correlation between core porosity and both sonic transit-time and resistivity for samples from overpressured zones (in contrast to normally pressured zones), illustrating how factor 4 affects log responses. Much of the residual scatter on the “cleaned-up” plots can probably be attributed to factors 1 and 2, and possibly 5 and 6. More detailed work is needed before useful and reliable mathematical relationships can be established for the core and log parameters.},

The concept of hydrological regime is introduced and applied to recognising deposits of geothermal activity, the level of preservation and permeable, potentially gold-bearing zones in ancient epithermal systems. Mixing models, such as Cl-enthalpy plots, and geothermometry can aid identification of breakthrough of edge waters and casing damage. Differences in the equilibration time of geothermometers may enable the thermal profile or history of the reservoir to be developed.

abstract = {This paper aims to resolve two main problems related to the formation of quartz veins: (1) the predominance of quartz veins at shallow crustal levels and not deeper in the crust, close to the source of metamorphic fluids where the temperature sensitivity of quartz solubility is much higher than at lower, upper-crustal temperatures and (2) the formation of very large 100–1000m scale quartz veins that would require huge amounts of fluid flow in current models of vein formation. It is proposed here that these problems are resolved by the recognition of very fast (m/s) mobile hydrofracture ascent of batches of fluid. Mobile hydrofractures are fluid-filled fractures that propagate at the upper tip and simultaneously close at the bottom end. As such, the fluid moves with its containing fracture. Mobile hydrofractures can attain larger sizes than predicted from current theory, due to a combination of channelling and accumulation at obstacles. The very fast ascent does not allow for significant cooling and precipitation of dissolved material during ascent and thus brings hot fluids with high concentrations of dissolved minerals to high levels in the crust. Precipitation of the dissolved material takes place immediately upon arrest, leading to possibly large mineral deposits at a single site (e.g. huge quartz veins) and, in some cases, extensive wall rock alteration. The vein and fracture structures that result from this process are emplacement structures, that only indirectly record the most important mode of fluid flow. The theory is applied to a case study on abundant and sometimes very large (>100m) quartz veins at Poolamacca Station, western New South Wales, Australia.},

abstract = {Heat is of fundamental importance in the genesis of continental rift zones. Heat flow data are available from the Baikal, Basin and Range (North America), East African, Rhine and Rio Grande rift systems, and most of the data indicate high heat flow, with means of 70-125 mW m-2, from the grabens in the rift systems. Data from the essentially non-volcanic sections of the East African rift system indicate normal to low heat flow, however. With the exception of the Basin and Range system, and parts of the Rio Grande system, the high heat flow appears to be restricted to the grabens, and is not measured on the broad domal or plateau uplifts associated with the rift systems. The uplifts associated with rifts typically are on the order of 1 to 2 km, with diameters of a few hundred kilometers or more, and the duration of the main phase of uplift is on the order of a few tens of million years, or less. These broad uplifts probably result from thermal changes in the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Two thermal models of the lithosphere are developed for comparison with the heat flow and uplift data. The first model assumes very slow lithospheric thinning so that the lithosphere remains in a state of quasi-equilibrium during the thinning. The second model assumes that thinning occurs at a rate significantly faster than heat can be conducted into the base of the lithosphere, with thermal relaxation of the lithosphere occurring after the cessation of thinning. Comparison of uplift rates with the model results indicates that for uplift purposes in rift genesis, the lithosphere is in a state between the two models i.e. partial heating of the lithosphere, or close to the rapid thinning state. Some uplift is predicted to continue after thinning has ceased due to thermal relaxation in the lithosphere. With respect to surface heat flow, however, the rapid thinning model is always predicted to apply, and a surface heat flow anomaly is not predicted to develop until after thinning has stopped. Local (graben) heat flow anomalies are thought to be primarily due to convection of heat into the rift zones by ascending magmas. A regional conducted thermal anomaly is not predicted to develop until after uplift is essentially complete. These predictions are compatible with the available heat flow and uplift data.},

abstract = {Abstract  The Red Dog ore deposit district in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska is host to several high-grade, shale-hosted Zn + Pb
deposits. Due to the complex history and deformation of these ore deposits, the geological and hydrological conditions at
the time of formation are poorly understood. Using geological observations and fluid inclusion data as constraints, numerical
heat and fluid flow simulations of the Anarraaq ore deposit environment and coupled reactive flow simulations of a section
of the ore body were conducted to gain more insight into the conditions of ore body formation. Results suggest that the ore
body and associated base metal zonation may have formed by the mixing of oxidized, saline, metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids
(<200°C) with reducing, HS-rich pore fluids within radiolarite-rich host rocks. Sphalerite and galena concentrations and base
metal sulfide distribution are primarily controlled by the nature of the pore fluids, i.e., the extent and duration of the
HS− source. Forward modeling results also predict the distribution of pyrite and quartz in agreement with field observations
and indicate a reaction front moving from the initial mixing interface into the radiolarite rocks. Heuristic mass calculations
suggest that ore grades and base metal accumulation comparable to those found in the field (18% Zn, 5% Pb) are predicted to
be reached after about 0.3 My for initial conditions (30 ppm Zn, 3 ppm Pb; 20% deposition efficiency).},

abstract = {Systematic examination of published sedimentary and metamorphosed pelite analyses has revealed evidence of significant mass transfer and volume strain during regional metamorphism. Statistical analysis of the data shows that Barrovian zone metamorphism of pelitic schist generally causes increases in the whole-rock concentrations of the low-solubility elements Ti and Al. The observed increases in Ti and Al contents as functions of metamorphic grade are almost certainly due to residual enrichment caused by the removal of other more soluble species. Application of mass-balance principles to the pelite compositional trends indicates that the average pelite may lose as much as 30% of its mass and volume during progressive metamorphism from subgreenschist to amphibolite facies conditions. The bulk of the lost mass is silica, not volatiles. In addition, other elements, particularly Ca, Na, and K, appear to be highly mobile in deep-crustal metamorphism. Contrary to conventional interpretations, it is concluded that the regional metamorphism of pelites is not an isochemical process. -Author},

abstract = {Vitrinite reflectance measurements on Pennsylvanian coals in the Illinois basin indicate significantly higher thermal maturity than can be explained by present-day burial depths. An interval of additional sedimentary section, now removed by erosion, has been suggested to account for the discrepancy. Although burial could indeed account for the observed maturity levels of organic matter, fluid-inclusion temperatures provide a stringent additional constraint. In this article, we combine measurements of coal maturity with fluid-inclusion temperatures from three sites to constrain the basin's thermal and burial history: the Fluorspar district at the Illinois basin's southern margin, the Upper Mississippi Valley zinc district at the basin's northern margin, and a north-central location. Two-dimensional numerical modeling of a north-south cross section through the basin tests scenarios both with and without regional fluid flow. Vitrinite reflectance values can be matched assuming burial by 1.8-2.8 km of southward-thickening additional, post-Pennsylvanian sedimentary section. In the central and northern Illinois basin, however, these burial depths and temperatures are not sufficient to account for the fluid-inclusion data. To account for both parameters with burial alone does not appear feasible. In contrast, our best hypothesis assumes a wedge of post-Pennsylvanian sediment-thickening southward to about 1.2 km and a brief period of magmatism in the Fluorspar district. Significant advective heat redistribution by northward regional fluid flow accounts for fluid-inclusion temperatures and coal maturities throughout the basin. The modeling results demonstrate the potential contribution of advective heat transport to the thermal history of the Illinois basin.},

abstract = {Since Vening-Meinesz's realization that the East African Rift represented an extensional, not compressional, feature and since the widespread acceptance of plate tectonics two decades later, research on the nature and causes of extensional tectonism within continental lithosphere has intensified. Among the manifestations of extensional processes affecting continental lithosphere are passive margins (Atlantic margin), discrete intracontinental rift zones (East African Rift), diffuse rifts (Basin and Range Province), strike-slip dominated rifts (Dead Sea Rift), and rifts in zones of regional compression (Tibetan grabens). Although no two rift zones are alike, continental rifts can generally be characterized by normal faulting with subsidiary strike-slip faulting, lithospheric thinning which outpaces crustal stretching, varying amounts of alkaline magmatism, heat flow that is locally elevated near faults and magmatic centers, and crust that has experienced magmatic underplating and some amount of magmatic intrusion. Most aspects of rift related deformation can be explained in terms of three parameters: (1) lithospheric and (sometimes) asthenospheric thermal structure, (2) lithospheric (particularly crustal) rheology, and (3) temporal factors such as the absolute age, timing, and rate of extension. The interaction of these physical parameters determines the eventual outcome of rifting (failure or progression to complete continental breakup), the patterns of subsidence and uplift, and the mode of extensional deformation. Modes of rifting (the lithosphere's mechanical response to extensional stress) can be broadly divided into pure shear, simple shear, and lower crustal flow mechanisms. In a general sense, these categories of rift mechanisms can account for observations at rifted margins, in the Basin and Range Province, and at metamorphic core complexes respectively. The mechanisms of continental lithosphere rifting (the effects) are here distinguished from the processes which actually drive extension (the causes). Following the terminology of previous authors, the causal processes are categorized as either passive or active: Passive processes originate at plate boundaries or in response to convective drag on the base of the lithosphere, while active processes are seated in the sublithospheric mantle and typically involve the interaction of mantle plumes and the lithospheric plates. A peculiar set of factors, including the local stress state, the retreat of a subducting plate, and convective instability of thickened crustal roots, may drive extension in compressional settings like Tibet. In the future, rifting studies are likely to focus on further clarification of the active and passive rifting terminology, better constraints on deformation rates and lithospheric rheology and thermal structure, along-axis segmentation of rifts, and the analogies and differences between rifting on Earth and nearby planets.},

abstract = {Global change encompasses changes in the characteristics of inter-related climate variables in space and time, and derived changes in terrestrial processes, including human activities that affect the environment. As such, projected global change includes groundwater systems. Here, groundwater is defined as all subsurface water including soil water, deeper vadose zone water, and unconfined and confined aquifer waters. Potential effects of climate change combined with land and water management on surface waters have been studied in some detail. Equivalent studies of groundwater systems have lagged behind these advances, but research and broader interest in projected climate effects on groundwater have been accelerating in recent years. In this paper, we provide an overview and synthesis of the key aspects of subsurface hydrology, including water quantity and quality, related to global change.Adaptation to global change must include prudent management of groundwater as a renewable, but slow-feedback resource in most cases. Groundwater storage is already over-tapped in many regions, yet available subsurface storage may be a key to meeting the combined demands of agriculture, industry, municipal and domestic water supply, and ecosystems during times of shortage. The future intensity and frequency of dry periods combined with warming trends need to be addressed in the context of groundwater resources, even though projections in space and time are fraught with uncertainty. Finally, potential impacts of groundwater on the global climate system are largely unknown. Research to improve our understanding of the joint behaviors of climate and groundwater is needed, and spin-off benefits on each discipline are likely. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

@article{Thiry2006,
abstract = {During the early Cretaceous, successive tectonic phases and several sea level falls resulted in the emersion of the main part of western Europe and the development of thick "lateritic" weathering. This long period of continental evolution ended with the Upper Cretaceous transgressions. During this period, the exposed lands displayed a mosaic of diverse morphologies and weathered landscapes.  Bauxites are the most spectacular paleoweathering features, known for long in southern France. Recently, new residual outcrops have been identified, trapped in the karstic depressions of the Grands Causses. Other bauxitic formations, containing gibbsite, have also been recognised, occurring with the Clay-with-Jurassic-cherts in the southeastern border of the Paris Basin. These bauxitic formations overlay Jurassic limestone and are buried beneath Upper Cretaceous marine deposits. The recognition of bauxites up north into the southern Paris Basin significantly widens the extension of the Lower Cretaceous bauxitic paleolandscapes.  On the Hercynian basements thick kaolinitic weathering mantles occur. They have been classically ascribed to the Tertiary. The first datings of these in situ paleosoils, by means of paleomagnetism and/or radiogenic isotopes, record especially early Cretaceous ages. This is the case for the "Siderolithic" formations on the edges of the French Massif Central, but also for the kaolinitic profiles in the Belgian Ardennes. In the Flanders, the Brabant basement is deeply kaolinised beneath the Upper Cretaceous cover. These paleosoils show polygenetic evolutions. The relief of these basement paleolandscapes may have been significant. There where probably high scarps (often of tectonic origin) reaching 200 m in elevation or beyond, as well as wide surfaces with inselbergs, as in the present day landscapes of tropical Africa and South America.  On the Jurassic limestone platforms occur diverse kaolinitic and ferruginous weathering products. Around the Paris Basin they show various facies, ranging from kaolinitic saprolites to ferricretes. Due to the lack of sedimentary cover, the age of these ferruginous and kaolinitic weathering products has been debated for long, most often allocated to the Siderolithic sensu lato (Eocene-Oligocene). Recent datings by paleomagnetism have enabled to date them (Borne de Fer in eastern Paris Basin) back also to the early Cretaceous (130 {+/-} 10 Ma). These wide limestone plateaus show karstified paleolandforms, such as vast closed and flat depressions broken by conical buttes, but also deep sinkholes in the higher areas of the plateaus and piedmonts. The depth of the karst hollows may be indicative of the range of relative paleoelevations. Dissolution holes display seldom contemporaneous karst fillings, thus implying that the karstland had not a thick weathering cover or that this cover had been stripped off before or by the late Cretaceous transgression. Nevertheless, some areas, especially above chert-bearing Jurassic limestone or marl, show weathering products trapped in the karst features or as a thick weathering mantle.  In the Paris Basin, the Wealden gutter looked like a wide floodplain in which fluvio-deltaic sands and clays were deposited and on which paleosoils developed during times of non-deposition. The edges of the gutter were shaped as piedmonts linked up with the upstream basement areas. The rivers flowing down to the plain deposited lobes of coarse fluvial sands and conglomerates. The intensity of the weathering, the thickness of the profiles and their maturation are directly dependent on the duration of the emersion and the topographic location relative to the gutter. Near the axis of the gutter, where emersion was of limited duration, the paleoweathering features are restricted to rubefaction and argillization of the Lower Cretaceous marine formations. On the other hand, on the borders of the basin and on the Hercynian basement, where emersion was of longer duration, the weathering profiles are thicker and more intensively developed.  The inventory of the Lower Cretaceous paleoweathering features shows the complexity of the continental history of this period. Moreover, the preserved weathering products are only a part of this long lasting period, all the aspects relative to erosion phases are still more difficult to prove and to quantify. In this domain, apatite fission tracks thermochronology (AFTT) can be helpful to estimate the order of magnitude of denudation. Residual testimonies and subsequent transgressions may enable to estimate relative elevations, but in return, we presently have no reliable tool to estimate absolute paleoelevations. In the work presented here, the inventory enabled to draw a continental paleogeographic map showing the nature of the weathering mantles and the paleolandscape features, just as paleoenvironments and paleobathymetry presently appear on marine paleogeographic maps. For the future, the challenge is to make progress in dating the paleoweathering profiles and especially in the resolution of these datings, in order to correlate precisely the continental records with the different events which trigger them (eustatism, climate, regional and global geodynamics). The final goal will be to build up a stratigraphic scale of the "continental geodynamic and climatic events" in parallel with "sequential stratigraphy" in the marine realm.},

abstract = {A method is presented that permits the length of any horizontal, confined fission-track inclined at a specified angle to the crystallographic c axis in apatite to be converted to an equivalent track length parallel to the crystallographic c axis. The model is based on the results of annealing experiments for six selected apatites (five calcian fluorapatites and Durango apatite) representing a subset of the 15 total apatite specimens studied. An iterative process of calculation is required to project fission-track lengths onto the c axis and computer source code implementing the solution to this problem is presented. This method of projecting apatite fission-track lengths onto the crystallographic c axis is shown to remove effectively fission-track length variation within single fission-track populations due to anisotropic track-length reduction for all 15 apatites studied. In addition, a model is developed that offers predictions that closely reproduce published experimental data concerning the relationship between fission-track density (etched fission tracks per unit area of apatite surface) and the arithmetic mean fission-track length. Finally, it is shown that natural fission-track populations exhibit fission-track length anisotropy similar to that of fission-track populations created and annealed in the laboratory. This observation implies that the same process by which apatite fission tracks anneal in the laboratory is responsible for annealing of apatite fission tracks in the geological environment.},

abstract = {A considerable body of evidence indicates that many of the extensional sedimentary basins in the vicinity of the British Isles underwent permanent exhumation during the Tertiary. The most dramatic indicator of this process is the present-day absence of as much as 4 km of anticipated postrift thermal subsidence in basins just north and west of Scotland. Any explanation of this observation must take into account the fact that the entire region has very small,-long-wavelength, free-air gravity anomalies. This important constraint implies either that the crust has been thickened or that low-density material has been added to or formed from the lithosphere and rules out models that invoke flexural effects arising from the opening of the North Atlantic. Tertiary epeirogeny is often attributed to compression that is assumed to be related in a general sense to Alpine mountain building. However, to remove [ ]3 km of sedi- mentary rock from a basin [ ]100 km wide requires >15 km of shortening. Minor Tertiary compression is observed all over the continental shelf, but nowhere is it sufficient to account for the required amount of uplift and erosion. In addition, exhumation dramatically increases from south to north, whereas the observed compression decreases markedly in the same direction. At the beginning of the Tertiary, rifting associated with the initiation of the Iceland plume generated substantial volumes of melt. Inversion of rare-earth- element concentrations of MgOrich igneous rocks suggests that a minimum of [ ]5 km of melt was produced beneath at least part of the continental shelf. We infer that much of this melt remains trapped within the lithosphere, presumably close to the Moho, which acted as a density filter. Such underplating will generate rapid uplift.},

Tracer abundances were elevated in the unconfined coastal aquifer and the nearshore zone, decreasing to low levels offshore, indicative of groundwater discharge (near-fresh, brackish, or saline) at all locations. At several sites, we detected evidence of fresh and saline SGD occurring simultaneously. Conservative estimates of SGD fluxes ranged widely, from 0.02–0.65 m3 m−2 d−1at the various sites. Groundwater nutrient fluxes of 0.04–40 mmol N m−2 d−1 and 0.01–1.6 mmol P m−2 d−1 represent a major source of new nutrients to coastal ecosystems along these coasts. Nutrient additions were typically greatest at locations with a substantial meteoric component in groundwater, but the recirculation of seawater through the aquifer may provide a means of transferring terrestrially-derived nutrients to the coastal zone at several sites.},

abstract = {Field determinations of heat flow and in situ stress orientations indicate that the San Andreas fault is anomalously weak. The weakness of this major transform fault has been attributed to several mechanisms, including the presence of serpentines, clays or other minerals with low coefficients of friction. The most plausible explanation for this weakness, however, relates to the distribution of fluid pressures within the fault zone and in the adjoining crust. In order to investigate the geochemistry and the role of fluids in the dynamics of this fault, we have carried out detailed chemical and isotopic analyses of water and associated gases from 41 thermal and saline springs and a few wells, together with about 20 cold springs, located along or near the San Andreas fault system between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Results show that the main trace of the San Andreas fault is conspicuously devoid of high-discharge springs, and the &#948;D and &#948;18O values establish that waters are predominantly of meteoric origin. The chemical compositions of water and gases are controlled mainly by the ambient rock types, and chemical geothermometry gives reservoir temperatures of 80&#8211;150&deg;C indicating shallow to moderate circulation depths of up to 6 km. However, compositions and isotope abundances of noble gases and &#948;13C values of HCO3 indicate a significant (up to 50%) mantle component for the volatiles. The relatively high fluxes of CO2 (C/3He &#8776; 1010) and other volatiles of mantle origin support a deep continuous flow model, especially at depths >6 km. Numerical simulations indicate that these high fluxes of CO2 of mantle and deep crustal origin are sufficient to generate lithostatic fluid pressures, and thus a weakened fault, in time scales comparable to those of earthquake cycles.},

abstract = {Thermal models of collisional orogens generally predict temperature structures that are much cooler than those recovered by thermobarometric studies. Here we demonstrate that high-temperature, low-pressure metamorphism and the development of inverted geotherms within collisional belts may be the result of accretion and erosion acting on crust enriched with heat-producing elements. A new two-dimensional finite difference model, described here, incorporates the subduction of lithosphere with heat-producing material in the upper crust, accretion of crustal material from the subducting plate to the upper plate, and surface erosion of the upper plate. These processes result in the development of a wedge of heat- producing material within the upper plate. The rate of heat production within the wedge and maximum depth of the wedge are the most important parameters controlling the magnitude of upper plate temperatures. Our model yields inverted upper plate geotherms when heat production rates exceed 0.75 mu W/m(3) and the heat-producing wedge extends to a depth greater than 35 km. Temperatures in excess of 500 degrees C at depths of 20-30 km are computed when heat production rates are greater than similar to 1.75 mu W/m(3) and the wedge extends to a depth > 50 km. Other processes, such as shear heating, fluid flow, or mantle delamination, need not be invoked to explain geologic evidence of high temperatures or inverted thermal gradients in collisional systems.},

abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

abstract = {Massive fluid circulation in retrogressive ductile shear zones is a well-established but poorly understood phenomenon. In some cases, surface-derived fluids, which must initially have been at hydrostatic pressures, can be shown to have entered shear zones in which fluids would normally be expected to be at lithostatic pressure. In these circumstances, thermal convection is an unlikely driving force for fluid movement. Underthrusting of a surficial fluid reservoir beneath shear zones is a viable mechanism in some cases, but not for metasomatic shear zones in the Pyrenees where insufficient underthrusting has occurred. Seismic pumping provides an alternative mechanism to explain the paradox of fluid access into ductile shear zones; a kinematic analysis of a hypothetical fault zone shows that stress and dilatancy cycles will be out of phase above and below the frictional/quasiplastic transition. If this effect is sufficiently large, hydraulic gradients may force fluid downward across the transition immediately after earthquake rupture through highly permeable microcrack networks. Between earthquake cycles, plastic creep in mylonites will overprint microcrack networks, increase fluid pressure, and promote slow upward movement of fluid at low permeability. For smaller shear zones, such as those in the Pyrenees, seismic pumping could occur down a shallow decollement with subsequent upward fluid flow through shear zones in the hanging wall of the decollement.},

@phdthesis{VanDerMolen2004,
abstract = {In the Netherlands offshore sector, available data and knowledge of the sediments of the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary (Danian) Chalk Group is limited due to its hitherto restricted significance as a hydrocarbon reservoir. For example, the stratigraphic subdivision of the Chalk in this area comprises only three formations, i.e. the Cenomanian Texel Formation (CKTX), the Turonian to Maastrichtian Ommelanden Formation (CKGR) and the Danian Ekofisk Formation (CKEK), contrary to more detailed subdivisions used in sectors where the Chalk does form an important hydrocarbon-producing interval. The first aim of this thesis is, therefore, to present a more detailed subdivision of the Chalk Group in the Dutch North Sea sector. Due to the scarcity of cored intervals and biostratigraphical data, this subdivision is largely based on the interpretation of geophysical data. The chalks of the North Sea area show a great variety of lithofacies resulting from a broad spectrum of depositional mechanisms and physical and chemical compaction processes. Chalk was originally formed by settling of calcareous nannoplankton remains from suspension in the water column. However, in areas that underwent significant tectonic activity, slope instability processes resulted in resedimentation of the autochthonous chalk. Investigation of these sedimentary processes, as well as their controls and products, not only yields additional information on the sedimentology and diagenesis of the Chalk Group, but also on the paleoenvironmental and basinal evolution of the study area during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleocene. Therefore, the second aim of this thesis is to reconstruct the sedimentary development of the Chalk Group in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. Although the Chalk Group is characterised by a remarkably uniform lithology, marked lateral variations in acoustic velocity are present throughout the North Sea basin. These acoustic velocity variations are primarily the result of variations in compaction, which in turn are caused by spatial differences in burial history. A better understanding of the spatial variation of seismic velocity therefore yields information about the compaction of the Chalk, the burial history of the sediment and helps to improve time-depth conversions through this interval. The third aim of this thesis is, therefore, to explain the regional variations in seismic velocity of the Chalk. The sedimentary development and seismostratigraphy of the Chalk were studied by seismic interpretation and well log correlation of this interval throughout the Dutch offshore area. The results are described in Chapter 2 Improved subdivision of the Chalk Group through mapping and facies analysis of seismic sequences. By integrating the results of Chapter 2, the regional tectono-sedimentary development of the Netherlands North Sea sector during the Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene was reconstructed, as described in Chapter 3, Cenomanian to Danian tectono-sedimentary development of the Netherlands North Sea area. Cyclicities in well log response, inferring sedimentary processes (pelagic vs. reworking) and sedimentation rates are discussed in Chapter 4, Meter-scale cyclicity in well logs of the Chalk Group, southern North Sea. The burial history of the Chalk Group, as studied by investigating acoustic velocities, is described in Chapter 5, Acoustic velocity and burial history analysis of the Chalk Group, Netherlands offshore. Chapter 6 Synthesis summarises the results.},

abstract = {Large numbers of bottom-hole temperatures (BHTs) and temperatures measured during drill-stem tests (DSTs) are available in areas explored for hydrocarbons, but their usefulness for estimating geothermal gradients and heat-flow density is limited. We investigated a large data set of BHT and DST measurements taken in boreholes in the American Midcontinent, a geologically uniform stable cratonic area, and propose an empirical correction for BHTs based on relationships between BHTs, DSTs, and thermal logs. This empirical correction is compared with similar approaches determined for other areas. The data were analyzed by multivariate statistics prior to the BHT correction to identify anomalous measurements and quantify external influences. Spatial patterns in temperature measurements for major stratigraphic units outline relations to regional structure. Comparision of temperature and structure trend-surface residuals reveals a relationship between temperature highs and local structure highs. The anticlines, developed by continuous but intermittent movement of basement fault blocks in the Late Paleozoic, are subtle features having closures of 10–30rm and contain relatively small hydrocarbon reservoirs. The temperature anomalies of the order of 5–7u°C may reflect fluids moving upward along fractures and faults, rather than changes in thermal conductivity resulting from different pore fluids.},

abstract = {A new model for examining fission-track data from natural specimens has been developed on the basis of new laboratory data describing fission-track annealing in a wide variety of apatites and the empirical correction for fission-track length anisotropy presented in earlier papers. Using revised and simplified statistical methods, we examine how well various empirical equations are able to fit the laboratory data and reproduce expected behavior on geological time scales. Based on the latter criterion, we find that so-called “fanning Arrhenius” models of mean track length are not the bestsuited for our data. Instead, we find that fitting c-axis projected lengths with a model that incorporates some curvature on an Arrhenius plot produces results that are in better agreement with the available geological benchmarks. In examining the relative annealing behavior of apatites with different resistance to annealing, we find that the laboratory-time-scale behavior of any two apatites can be reproduced well by a simple one- or two-parameter equation. This function is used to convert the reduced fission-track length of one apatite that has undergone a certain time-temperature history into the length that would be measured in a second, less-resistant apatite that has undergone the same history. Using this conversion, we create a single model that encompasses the annealing behavior of all of the apatites we studied. The predictions made by this model match closely those made by fits to data for individual apatites. We therefore infer that, although the conversion equation is imperfect, it presents an excellent practical solution to characterizing the range of kinetic variability for annealing of fission tracks in apatite.},

@article{Connolly1997,
abstract = {The obstruction to fluid flow formed by the rocks overlying a metamorphic devolatilization front causes the fluid pressure gradient in the reacting rocks to diverge from lithostatic. This drives deformation in tandem with the fluid pressure anomaly generated by the volume change of the reaction. Numerical simulations show that once the vertical extent of the reacted rocks is comparable to the compaction length, compaction processes caused by the difference between confining and fluid pressure gradients generate a positive fluid pressure anomaly (effective pressure < 0) above the reaction front, irrespective of the reaction volume change. Consequent dilational deformation propagates the anomaly upward, leading to underpressuring and densification at the reaction front and detachment of a wave of anomalous fluid pressure and porosity. Creep is a viable mechanism for such wave propagation for crustal viscosities < 10(15) MPa s. Continuous upward strengthening of the crust increases the wavelength and amplitude of the fluid pressure waves and thereby the likelihood of hydrofracture. Order of magnitude strength contrasts are adequate to arrest wave propagation, forming water sills that become increasingly stable in the absence of deviatoric stress. Although the fluid pressure gradient within a wave may be near hydrostatic, Rayleigh convection is unlikely. Thus, in the absence of lateral perturbations, fluid flow is upward and episodic, despite continuity of devolatilization. Porosity waves provide a mechanism for temporal focusing of metamorphic fluid fluxes with the potential to increase the efficacy of heat and mass transport.},

abstract = {In Morocco, it is generally considered that post-Hercynian vertical movements were limited to the Atlas system, the passive continental margin and the Rif. Apatite FT and He ages from the Moroccan Meseta (Rehamna and Zaer Massif) document instead two episodes of subsidence and exhumation in Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and during the Late Cretaceous to Neogene. The Meseta subsided to >3�km depth during the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic and was exhumed to the surface before the Late Cretaceous, during the rift and post-rift stages of Central Atlantic opening. Erosion of the exhuming rocks is responsible for a thick package of terrigenous sands found in the Moroccan offshore and elsewhere along the NW Africa margin. About 1�km of subsidence affected the Meseta during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. During the Neogene, these areas were brought back to the surface in association with bimodal folding with wavelengths of 1002013150�km and >500�km. Terra Nova, 20, 3552013363, 2008},

abstract = {Topographic elevation and sediment consolidation are principal components that determine pressure distribution and flow of fluids in a sedimentary basin. Although fluid flow as a result of topographic elevation can be easily simulated, porewater movement as a result of consolidation of sediment requires a physically more complex approach, as it involves sediment deformation, moving boundaries and changing sediment properties. This paper describes a mathematical model based on Terzaghi's theory of the consolidation process that calculates fluid flow as a result of consolidation, and additionally incorporates fluid flow from topographic elevation. Porosity changes are calculated as a function of fluid pressure changes, using the equation of state for porosity, thereby avoiding empirical porosity/depth formulations such as Athy's equation. It is assumed that hydraulic conductivity and sediment compressibility are reduced during consolidation, and hydraulic diffusivity remains approximately constant during the consolidation process. The permeability/porosity relation is described by the Kozeny-Carman function. The capabilities of the program are illustrated by two simple experiments.},

abstract = {The North Slope foreland basin, Alaska, USA is an east–west asymmetrical trough-shaped basin adjacent to the Brooks Range fold-thrust mountain belt. Lower Cretaceous age rocks make up much of the sediment fill, including flysch-like marine turbidites and shales of the Torok and Fortress Mountain formations and marine and sandstones, shales and conglomerates of the overlying Nanushuk group. Lower Cretaceous age rocks were deposited on top of a Palaeozoic and Mesozoic age passive margin sequence. We have conducted numerical simulations of fluid flow driven by topographic recharge in the Central North Slope foreland basin. These simulations are constrained by salinity estimates from well logs, location of oil and gas fields, vitrinite reflectance and heat flow measurements. Our model results indicate that there are two south to north pathways for fluid migration. The primary pathway for fluid movement is downward through the Fortress Mountain formation, then upwards along the interface between the Fortress Mountain and Torok Formation and finally northward through the permeable Nanushuk group. A smaller mass of groundwater moves along sands below the Torok formation and into offshore sediments north of Alaska. Very little meteoric water enters the underlying Palaeozoic rocks in our simulations, which could explain the presence of deep saline pore waters. Our results also show that permafrost is a primary control on the pathway and rate of fluid flow by controlling the distribution of surface recharge and discharge. For example, areas of high heat flow and low saline waters along the arctic coast may represent upward groundwater discharge because of the absence of permafrost. As surface temperatures were warmer in the Miocene, the absence of permafrost would produce a more local fluid circulation pattern and less transfer of heat energy from south to north.},

abstract = {The genetic variation observed in the modern European populations can be used to reconstruct the history of the human peopling of the continent. In recent times, a great importance has been given to uniparental markers such as the Y-chromosome. This chromosome, which is passed from father to son, does not have a counterpart subject to recombination and the only possible source of variation is mutation. The nucleotide changes accumulate over time in the molecule, with no rearrangement among lineages. Lately, the D-HPLC technique, which allows the effective detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was used to boost the number of available polymorphisms on the Y-chromosome. Since the year 2000, a number of studies were aimed both at the reconstruction of Y-chromosome phylogeny and the geographic distribution of Y-chromosome variation in Europe. The distribution of distinctive Y-chromosome lineages can also display a correspondence with geography, thus providing patterns of affinity and clues concerning past human movements. It is therefore possible to recognize the effect of the colonization of Europe following the Last Glacial Maximum, both from the western Iberian and the eastern Balkan refuges. Other lineages show a migratory wave from the Near East, consistent with the demic diffusion model of agriculture. A minor east-west genetic cline was proposed as a signal of an expansion from north of the Black Sea, related with the diffusion of people speaking languages of the Indo-European family.},

annote = {Intraplate compressional features, such as inverted extensional basins, upthrust basement blocks and whole lithospheric folds, play an important role in the structural framework of many cratons. Although compressional intraplate deformation can occur in a number of dynamic settings, stresses related to collisional plate coupling appear to be responsible for the development of the most important compressional intraplate structures. These can occur at distances of up to �1600 km from a collision front, both in the fore-arc (foreland) and back-arc (hinterland) positions with respect to the subduction system controlling the evolution of the corresponding orogen. Back-arc compression associated with island arcs and Andean-type orogens occurs during periods of increased convergence rates between the subducting and overriding plates. For the build-up of intraplate compressional stresses in fore-arc and foreland domains, four collision-related scenarios are envisaged: (1) during the initiation of a subduction zone along a passive margin or within an oceanic basin; (2) during subduction impediment caused by the arrival of more buoyant crust, such as an oceanic plateau or a microcontinent at a subduction zone; (3) during the initial collision of an orogenic wedge with a passive margin, depending on the lithospheric and crustal configuration of the latter, the presence or absence of a thick passive margin sedimentary prism, and convergence rates and directions; (4) during post-collisional over-thickening and uplift of an orogenic wedge. The build-up of collision-related compressional intraplate stresses is indicative for mechanical coupling between an orogenic wedge and its fore- and/or hinterland. Crustal-scale intraplate deformation reflects mechanical coupling at crustal levels whereas lithosphere-scale deformation indicates mechanical coupling at the level of the mantle-lithosphere, probably in response to collisional lithospheric over-thickening of the orogen, slab detachment and the development of a mantle back-stop. The intensity of collisional coupling between an orogen and its fore- and hinterland is temporally and spatially variable. This can be a function of oblique collision. However, the build-up of high pore fluid pressures in subducted sediments may also account for mechanical decoupling of an orogen and its fore- and/or hinterland. Processes governing mechanical coupling/decoupling of orogens and fore- and hinterlands are still poorly understood and require further research. Localization of collision-related compressional intraplate deformations is controlled by spatial and temporal strength variations of the lithosphere in which the thermal regime, the crustal thickness, the pattern of pre-existing crustal and mantle discontinuities, as well as sedimentary loads and their thermal blanketing effect play an important role. The stratigraphic record of collision-related intraplate compressional deformation can contribute to dating of orogenic activity affecting the respective plate margin.},

The Lake Hughes site is one of three radon monitoring stations located near the "big bend" segment of the San Andreas fault which began to record anomalous radon levels in August 1981. Two stations, Lake Hughes and Lytle Creek, recorded anomalous increases in radon while the third, Sky Forest, recorded an anomalous decrease. Several weeks after the onset of the anomaly, strongly correlated radon fluctuations began at Lake Hughes and Lytle Creek. These radon spikes also were found to be phase anti&#8208;correlated with barometric pressure fluctuations. Analyses of gas grab samples showed relatively high levels of CO2 and ethylene in borehole air at Lake Hughes and Lytle Creek, while analyses of water samples showed relatively large increases in HCO3            &#8722; at both sites. Isotopic analysis of one gas sample from Lake Hughes yielded a 13C &#948; value of &#8722;22 &#8240;, which suggests that the CO2 originates from the oxidation of organic material. The correlation in radon fluctuations at Lake Hughes and Lytle Creek and their common dependence on barometric pressure changes began shortly after the onset of the radon anomaly in August, and probably resulted from the simultaneous saturation of the water in these boreholes with carbon dioxide. },

abstract = {The oxygen-isotope compositions and paragenetic sequence of diagenetic minerals from the Lower Cretaceous Viking sandstone and conglomerate from south-central Alberta, Canada have been used to identify changes in porewater composition during diagenesis and to relate these changes to major geological events within the western Canada sedimentary basin. Large-scale influx of meteoric water has played an important role in diagenesis of this unit, especially following uplift of the basin in early Eocene time.Diagenetic phases include early kaolinite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 24.9 to +28.2 ‰), siderite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 22.0 to + 23.9 ‰; $\delta$13C PDB = −6.3 to −1.3 ‰), calcite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 26.0 ‰; $\delta$13C PDB = −0.4 ‰) and chlorite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 10.7 − + 13.4 ‰), followed in order by dolomite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 19.3 − + 22.1 ‰; $\delta$13C PDB = −5.9 to −2.6 ‰), calcite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 13.9 − + 15.9 ‰; $\delta$13C PDB = −8.4 to −6.1 ‰), ankerite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 16.3 − + 17.9 ‰; $\delta$13C PDB = −12.4 to −3.5 ‰), kaolin group minerals ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 12.0 − + 15.7 ‰), and illite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 14.2 − + 15.7 ‰) and illite/smectite ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 13.8 − + 16.5 ‰). Quartz overgrowths ($\delta$18O SMOW = + 16.2 − + 27.4 ‰) began crystallizing relatively early during burial diagenesis and continued to form at least up to the onset of late diagenetic formation of clay minerals.The interpretation of these results is that shallow diagenesis, early in the burial history (glauconite, pyrite, calcite, chlorite), occurred largely in the presence of seawater-derived fluids, although a freshwater influence is indicated where siderite and(or) early kaolinite cements are abundant. As compaction and burial diagenesis proceeded (diagenetic chlorite, quartz overgrowths, dolomite), the porewaters became enriched in 18O due to water/rock interaction. Burial diagenesis was terminated in the early Eocene by uplift related to the major Laramide Orogeny. Recharge of the basin by low 18O meteoric water occurred at this time. The meteoric water then became involved in the formation of diagenetic quartz, calcite and ankerite (and the dissolution and albitization of feldspar) at or near maximum burial temperatures, and in the crystallization at lower temperatures of kaolin group minerals, illite and illite/smectite as the post-Eocene erosion progressed. },

@article{Edmunds2012,
abstract = {The recent paper on Africa's groundwater byMacDonald etal (2012) has attracted much attention. This is good news, especially since groundwater has been widely ignored, misunderstood or abused, as a fundamental global resource. This important paper goes a long way to raising the profile of groundwater in Africa by providing first-order estimates of the available storage (taking account of saturated aquifer thickness and porosity) as well as mapping expected water yields (aquifer productivity) in that continent. Reliable estimates of groundwater resources can now be set against the far more widely reported surface water availability. The constraints of the methodology used to compile these maps are duly acknowledged, and are well within the hydrogeological state-of-the-art. The paper is backed by carefully reviewed sources of data and a considerable effort has been made to incorporate the extensive grey literature. It is important that this benchmark study is received with the acclaim it deserves. However, the headline - that groundwater storage is some 100 times the annual renewable surface waters - could be misconstrued as implying that groundwater is an abundant new resource, which it is not. Whilst groundwater is key to sustainable development, renewability and accessibility issues need to be addressed. The paper may therefore be seized upon to justify unsustainable groundwater exploitation, or to provide an argument against funding to NGOs and others, for water provision for needy communities. Some constraints that must be taken into account are elaborated here. The conclusions of the paper (MacDonald etal 2012) demonstrate that modest yields of groundwater are quite widely available at accessible depths and sufficient to sustain small communities and their development, but larger yields (>5ls -1) suitable for urban development or major agricultural schemes are unlikely outside of the sedimentary terrain. The availability and accessibility of groundwater over much of Africa, therefore, is favourable to rural rather than urban development. One of the real opportunities presented in the paper is that groundwater should be more widely used for a revolution in rural development. To this end, the use of managed aquifer recharge (MAR), coupled with other forms of rainwater harvesting, can also locally conserve and augment groundwater resources and offer obvious advantages over building surface water storage. The large sedimentary aquifers of Africa contain some 0.66millionkm3 in storage (MacDonald etal 2012); but most of this water (0.44Mkm3) is contained beneath eight Saharan countries (see table 1, MacDonald etal 2012). This includes the Nubian Sandstone aquifer system, underlying Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad. In Libya this immense high yielding aquifer may be over 2.5km thick(Pallas 1980) but considerable depths to the water table make for costly development. Water in Libya is currently being extracted (mined) from remote inland areas for transmission to the coast, from wells typically 300-500m deep with estimated well-field lifetimes unlikely to exceed 50years (Pallas and Salem 2001). This and the other Saharan aquifers are accessible only to a very small fraction of the African population. Groundwater extraction and transmission is possible only with the energy provided from the proximity of fossil fuels; large water transfer schemes are energy intensive and for most areas of Africa not an economic option, having also social and ecological consequences(Matete and Hassan 2005). Moreover a steady decline in water tables (typically from 0.5 to 2m yr) has been taking place widely in semi-arid areas globally, mostly due to abstraction exceeding recharge, with consequences for both human requirements and ecosystems. Thus a major limiting factor is the need to identify whether the stored groundwater is a renewable or a non-renewable resource. In the case of deep basins such as the Saharan aquifers this water can be shown, from numerous studies, to be almost entirely non-renewable, 'fossil' water, recharged under wetter early Holocene or late Pleistocene climates, prior to onset of a more arid climate around 4500years BP (Edmunds etal 2004). Small amounts of modern recharge (for example in the Atlas Mountains or Tibesti) are insufficient to have an impact on the drawdown of distant well fields. It is critical, therefore, to base resource estimates for any development on knowledge of the locally renewable amounts from rainfall and to consider mining palaeo-reserves only as a last resort. Hydrogeological techniques are available to quantify modern recharge (Scanlon and Cook 2002, Scanlon etal 2006) and rates can vary widely according to rock type and landscape; reliance on modelled estimates alone could be misleading. Water quality is also a limiting factor in quantifying usable fresh groundwater storage. In addition to the regional or local problems caused by fluoride, in areas of East and West Africa (MacDonald etal2012), salinity, above all, will restrict the total usable storage for domestic use and food production, most notably in semi-arid or arid areas. Groundwater salinity arises from various sources, including lithologies containing evaporite minerals, residual sea water (especially in continental coastal margins) and evapotranspiration. As a general rule, salinity increases with depth (older waters tend to more saline), but an additional problem arises where salinity has built up due to aridification over several millennia. Playas and sebkhats are surface expressions of this salinity accumulation from surface water or groundwater discharge, but clearance of native vegetation also increases recharge and leads to salinity increase (George etal1997). Near-surface salt accumulation may be drawn down into cones of depression in areas of development. One of the largest artesian aquifers, the Continental Intercalaire of Algeria and Tunisia, has groundwater discharge with a salinity of 1-3gl-1, locally as high as 7gl-1 in the Tunisian Chotts (Edmunds etal 2003, Zammouri etal 2007), limiting water for irrigated agriculture. The volumes of non-saline and groundwater in the total storage therefore need to be considered as part of the storage.

abstract = {The influence of fortnightly spring-neap tidal variability on submarine discharge of fresh and saline groundwater was examined at Stinson Beach, California. Stinson Beach is a residential community that utilizes on-site systems for wastewater disposal. Fresh, shallow groundwater at the site contains high concentrations of nutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen DIN, soluble reactive phosphate SRP, and silicate) and human fecal bacteria. A groundwater-derived freshening and nutrification of the surf zone during neap tides was observed, followed by a 4-d increase in chlorophyll a concentrations. Analytical models and a freshwater budget in the surf zone were used to estimate the saline and fresh discharge of submarine groundwater. We estimate fresh groundwater discharge between 1.2 and 4.7 L min(-1) m(-1) shoreline during neap tides compared with 0.1 and 0.5 L min(-1) m(-1) during spring tides. This compares with 15.9 and 22.0 L min(-1) m(-1) saline groundwater discharge (forced by waves and tides) during neap and spring tides, respectively. Despite the smaller total (fresh + saline) flux of groundwater during neap compared with spring tides, the larger fresh discharge component during neap tides raises surf zone silicate, DIN, and SRP by 14%, 35%, and 27%, respectively, relative to spring tides. This observed fortnightly pulsing of fresh groundwater-derived nutrients was consistent with seaward hydraulic gradients across the fresh part of the beach aquifer, which varied due to aquifer overheight near the beach face. Darcy-Dupuit estimates of seaward fresh groundwater flow in this area agreed well with the fresh discharge results of the mass balance.},

This discharge delivers enough nitrate to replace that dissolved in the lagoon water mass about every eight days and enough silicate to replace the lagoon silicate in about 48 days. The delivery rate of nitrate nitrogen by SGD is equal to about 48% of that required for observed growth rates of lagoon macrophytes. Surface salinity is lower close to the shore as a result of SGD. During calm conditions a salinity front was observed in the lagoon, with a nearshore pool of nutrient-enriched water floating above the more saline ocean water.},

abstract = {Carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotope data for calcites and dolomites from the Devonian Obed platform in Alberta, Canada, demonstrate that (1) both limestones and dolostones of the Obed platform underwent significant deep-burial cementation and recrystallization, (2) calcites experienced more extensive geochemical alteration than did dolomites under deep-burial conditions, and (3) the fluids that facilitated deep-burial carbonate diagenesis probably were partially derived from the Rocky Mountain fold-and-thrust belt. The more extensive degree of recrystallization of calcite is shown especially by its higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios. A lesser degree of 13C depletion in dolomites indicates that dolomite recrystallization partially coincided with hydrocarbon oxidation. Evidence supporting interpretation 3 (above) includes fractures and vugs bearing late-diagenetic calcite cements that have extremely high 87Sr/86Sr ratios, including the highest ratios reported thus far for any diagenetic carbonates from western Canada (0.7252). In carbonates, values this high are found only in tectonic veins in Proterozoic clastic rocks in the Rocky Mountains and in the Obed platform about 100 km into the foreland basin. The late-diagenetic calcite cements also have highly depleted {delta}13C values (minimum -27.1{per thousand} relative to PDB [Peedee belemnite]), indicating incorporation of oxidized carbon from thermochemical sulfate reduction.  The process of carbonate cementation and recrystallization in strata of the Obed platform probably occurred during deep burial (maximum 5-7 km) and was effected by a hot (>100 {degrees}C) mixture of connate brines and hydrothermal or metamorphic fluids that were expelled from the Rocky Mountain fold-and-thrust belt during the Laramide orogeny. The data also suggest that (1) the common practice of using limestones to establish marine or original geochemical baselines for stable and radiogenic isotope interpretations must be conducted with caution, and (2) replacement burial dolostones are quite resistant to burial recrystallization. Finally, the geochemical trace of tectonically expelled fluids may be limited to about 100 km into the foreland basin, implying that the volumes and/or fluxes of fluids produced by tectonic expulsion are rather low.},

abstract = {TOPO-EUROPE addresses the 4-D topographic evolution of the orogens and intra-plate regions of Europe through a multidisciplinary approach linking geology, geophysics, geodesy and geotechnology. TOPO-EUROPE integrates monitoring, imaging, reconstruction and modelling of the interplay between processes controlling continental topography and related natural hazards. Until now, research on neotectonics and related topography development of orogens and intra-plate regions has received little attention. TOPO-EUROPE initiates a number of novel studies on the quantification of rates of vertical motions, related tectonically controlled river evolution and land subsidence in carefully selected natural laboratories in Europe. From orogen through platform to continental margin, these natural laboratories include the Alps/Carpathians-Pannonian Basin System, the West and Central European Platform, the Apennines-Aegean-Anatolian region, the Iberian Peninsula, the Scandinavian Continental Margin, the East-European Platform, and the Caucasus-Levant area. TOPO-EUROPE integrates European research facilities and know-how essential to advance the understanding of the role of topography in Environmental Earth System Dynamics. The principal objective of the network is twofold. Namely, to integrate national research programs into a common European network and, furthermore, to integrate activities among TOPO-EUROPE institutes and participants. Key objectives are to provide an interdisciplinary forum to share knowledge and information in the field of the neotectonic and topographic evolution of Europe, to promote and encourage multidisciplinary research on a truly European scale, to increase mobility of scientists and to train young scientists. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of continental topography research, and of the challenges to TOPO-EUROPE researchers in the targeted natural laboratories.},

abstract = {The Rhine Rift System (RRS) forms part of the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) and transects the Variscan Orogen, Permo-Carboniferous troughs and Late Permian to Mesozoic thermal sag basins. Crustal and lithospheric thicknesses range in the RRS area between 24–36 km and 50–120 km, respectively. We discuss processes controlling the transformation of the orogenically destabilised Variscan lithosphere into an end-Mesozoic stabilised cratonic lithosphere, as well as its renewed destabilisation during the Cenozoic development of ECRIS. By end-Westphalian times, the major sutures of the Variscan Orogen were associated with 45–60 km deep crustal roots. During the Stephanian-Early Permian, regional exhumation of the Variscides was controlled by their wrench deformation, detachment of subducted lithospheric slabs, asthenospheric upwelling and thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere. By late Early Permian times, when asthenospheric temperatures returned to ambient levels, lithospheric thicknesses ranged between 40 km and 80 km, whilst the thickness of the crust was reduced to 28–35 km in response to its regional erosional and local tectonic unroofing and the interaction of mantle-derived melts with its basal parts. Re-equilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system governed the subsidence of Late Permian-Mesozoic thermal sag basins that covered much of the RRS area. By end-Cretaceous times, lithospheric thicknesses had increased to 100–120 km. Paleocene mantle plumes caused renewed thermal weakening of the lithosphere. Starting in the late Eocene, ECRIS evolved in the Pyrenean and Alpine foreland by passive rifting under a collision-related north-directed compressional stress field. Following end-Oligocene consolidation of the Pyrenees, west- and northwest-directed stresses originating in the Alps controlled further development of ECRIS. The RRS remained active until the Present, whilst the southern branch of ECRIS aborted in the early Miocene. Extensional strain across ECRIS amounts to some 7 km. Plume-related thermal thinning of the lithosphere underlies uplift of the Rhenish Massif and Massif Central. Lithospheric folding controlled uplift of the Vosges-Black Forest Arch.},

abstract = {Middle–Late Pleistocene tectonic activity has been inferred through studies on travertine deposits exposed in a tract of the hinterland Northern Apennines. A detailed study on the relationships between tectonics and travertine deposition coupled with 230Th/234U age deter- mination of travertines at Cava Oliviera quarry, located close to Serre di Rapolano village (southern Tuscany, Northern Apennines), allowed us to recognise Pleistocene faults, whose activity has been referred to 157–24 ka, at least. Travertine deposition was tectonically controlled by WSW-ENE striking, oblique and normal faults, associated to a main fault (named as the Violante Fault). This struc- ture dissected a regional normal fault (known as the Rapolano Fault) Early–Middle Pliocene in age, which bounded the eastern side of the Pliocene Siena Basin, and gave rise to space accommodation for clayey and sandy marine sediments. Hydrothermal circulation (and related travertine deposition) was favoured by the damaging enhancement due to the fault–fault intersection. Tectonic activity has been also documented by deformation recorded by travertines, which suggest a main tectonic event between 64 ± 5 and 40 ± 5 ka. The tectonic activity described for the study area agrees with the Quaternary tectonic evolution documented in the surrounding areas (e.g. Mt. Amiata and Mt. Vulsini), as well as the Tyrrhe- nian margin of the Central Apennines, indicating that a widespread tectonic activity affected the inner part of the Apennines until the latest Quaternary.},

abstract = {The Mesozoic North Sea rift forms an integral part of the Arctic-North Atlantic rift system. Rifting activity in the North Sea commenced during the earliest Triassic. During the mid-Jurassic the central North Sea underwent a temporary doming stage. Crustal extension peaked during the Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous, abated subsequently and terminated altogether during the Paleocene. The saucer-shaped Cenozoic post-rift basin straddles the axis of the Viking and Central grabens. This speaks for the applicability of a depth dependent pure shear model rather than a simple shear model. Geophysical data indicate an important discrepancy between upper and lower crustal attenuation across the North Sea rift, suggesting that during rifting processes the Mono-discontinuity was seriously destabilized. This requires a basic modification of currently favoured crustal stretching models.},

abstract = {Apatite separated from 47 Cretaceous and Tertiary drill core and surface samples from the foreland basin strata of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) have been analyzed for their apatite fission track (AFT) age and confined track length distribution. Thermal histories of the fission track data were then estimated using a constrained random search inversion technique based on the Durango apatite annealing model. Most importantly, this technique provides an estimate of the peak postdepositional temperature experienced by each sample with error bounds determined by the precision of the fission track data. Most apatite samples retain at least some tracks that formed prior to the time of maximum Cenozoic burial, assumed to be coincident with maximum temperature. Seven apatite samples were fully annealed during burial, during or following the Laramide Orogeny, and provide a minimum age of 42 Ma for heating. Lower Cretaceous samples from near the deformation front were fully annealed and attained temperatures of at least 119°–138°C during maximum burial. In contrast, stratigraphically equivalent samples at the northeastern end of the transect near the Cold Lake heavy oil and tar sand deposits did not exceed 80°C. Paleogeothermal gradients calculated using bounded estimates of the peak temperatures experienced by the samples, together with maximum burial estimates from coal moisture studies, range from ∼20°C/km near the deformation front to as high as 60°C/km near the cratonic edge of the basin. This variation has the same trend as present geothermal gradients, which range from ∼30°C/km to 45°C/km, but indicates a greater contrast at the end of the Laramide. The results are consistent with the concept of heat transport by basinal scale fluid flow.},

abstract = {The identification and quantification of conductive and convective components in the heat transfer of a sedimentary basin is demonstrated for the Rheingraben. Three different methods of varying complexity as well as three independent data sets are employed: (1) energy budget considerations based on hydraulically perturbed thermal data from shallow boreholes (\textless 500 m), (2) 1-D vertical Peclet number analysis of thermal data from 22 deep boreholes (\textgreater 1000 m), and (3) 2-D finite difference modelling of the fully coupled fluid flow and heat transport equations on a vertical cross-section of the entire Rheingraben. Energy budget considerations yield a conductive basal heat flow density of 84 + 40/-10 mW m-2, and in good agreement with this Peclet number analysis, gives median values in the range 90 +- 35 mW m-2. In the first case, the basement is formed by low permeable, tertiary sediments at about 500 m depth, and in the second by the transition from the sedimentary graben fill to the crystalline basement at depths of between 2000 and 4000 m. It is shown how results from numerical modelling support the flow field assumptions made by methods (1) and (2), as well as the value of 80 +- 10 mW m-2 for average basal heat flow density entering the graben from below. Conversely, the Peclet number range Pe ≤ 1.2 inferred from method (2) can be applied for a (at least partial) calibration of the fully coupled hydrothermal model calculations. This technique is suggested as a potentially interesting thermal method for constraining regional-scale permeability. An interpretation of heat transport is presented that satisfies the experimentally established patterns of both temperature and heat flow density in the Rheingraben. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the thermal anomalies along the western rim of the graben (such as Pechelbronn, France or Landau, Germany) can be convincingly explained by a basin-wide, deep rooted E-W groundwater circulation that locally enhances a background basal heat flow density of about 80 mW m-1 on average by 50 per cent and at individual sites by as much as 120 per cent.},

abstract = {During contact metamorphism, fluid production from magma and wall rocks, thermal expansion of fluid, thermal and chemical buoyancy, topography, and deformation of rocks all interact to drive fluid flow. An understanding of how these processes interact is necessary to predict the evolution of fluid flow, fluid pressures, and permeability; to evaluate mechanisms of ore deposition, metasomatism, and heat transfer; and to apply petrologic, field, and geochemical data to infer hydrologic histories. Results from finite-difference models that account for many of these processes reveal the hydrodynamics of contact metamorphism. A systematic evolution in flow system from lithostatic fluid pressures and expulsion of internally generated fluids, to hydrostatic fluid pressures and circulation of externally derived fluids is predicted to occur with time, increasing permeability, and decreasing depth. Fluid production from magmas and wall rocks is the dominant process elevating fluid pressures toward lithostatic values during prograde metamorphism; other processes, such as strain or thermal expansion of the fluid, are less significant. For typical water contents of magmas and wall rocks, permeabilities of 2 ) are required to produce lithostatic fluid pressures in the aureole. Consideration of processes controlling permeability suggests that fluid flow is likely intergranular during prograde metamorphism and channelized during retrograde metamorphism. Balance of rates of thermal fracturing and mineral deposition implies that permeability should increase above 1 mu d during cooling, and thus fluid pressures should drop abruptly toward hydrostatic values once cooling and fracturing ensues. Rocks near the contact cool first, and complex mixing of magmatic, metamorphic, and meteoric fluids is likely in this region. If permeability increases during cooling, meteoric fluids may dominate the total fluid budget even though rocks interact with only magmatic and metamorphic fluids during prograde metamorphism. Many broad features of the models are similar to patterns observed in porphyry copper deposits. Models with ad hoc assumptions of permeability near the contact are required to produce significant up-temperature fluid flow during prograde metamorphism, a pattern predicted from some reaction-transport models.},

abstract = {Tectonic studies show that intraplate Europe is more active than might be expected from its tectonic setting. We employ integrative analysis of various datasets, which provides new understanding of deformation processes in response to different types of loading. A 3D strength model of the lithosphere, which is based on existing structural, compositional and thermal models of the lithosphere, forms the basis for this study. Boundaries of the crustal layers are determined from existing seismic data. Constraints on the thermal structure of the lithosphere are obtained from heat flow studies and upper mantle seismic tomography. The calculated strength distribution is used to quantify spatial variations in effective elastic plate thickness (EET) of the European lithosphere. A comparison with seismic and geodetic strain rates provides new insights into the localization of intraplate deformation. Another important indication of lithospheric strength is provided by the residual mantle gravity anomalies obtained after removing the crustal contribution from the observed gravity field. We have found significant spatial variations in rigidity within the Central and Western European lithosphere, in contrast with a more uniform strong lithosphere of the East European Platform. These variations are consistent with differences in the density structure of the mantle lithosphere reflected in mantle gravity anomalies. Western Europe is mostly characterized by negative mantle gravity anomalies and low \{EET\} values (generally ≤ 20 km), whereas the opposite is true for Eastern Europe. Large differences exist also for specific tectonic units: e.g. a pronounced contrast in lithosphere properties is found between the strong Adriatic plate and the weak Pannonian Basin area, as well as between the Baltic Shield and the North Sea rift system. We demonstrate that the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS), which is characterized by low \{EET\} values and negative mantle gravity anomalies, localizes neotectonic deformation manifested by relatively high geodetic and seismic strain rates.},

Cenozoic evolution of the rift was synchronous with lithospheric plate interactions along and under the western North American margin: Paleocene-Eocene: Laramide primarily amagmatic compression related to flat-slab subduction; Oligocene: intermediate to silicic volcanism related to collapse of the slab; Miocene to present: rifting related to complex plate interactions overprinted on the previous history. Cenozoic paleogeographic and paleotectonic characteristics are consistent with a passive-mantle mode of rifting. North-central New Mexico provides a unique opportunity to constrain models for rift initiation and evolution. It is one of the few locations within any rift where excellently exposed pre-rift and syn-rift basin fill has been studied thoroughly enough to allow detailed paleogeographic reconstruction for almost the entire Cenozoic. Cenozoic paleogeography for the study area is summarized as follows: (1) Eocene (58-37 Ma): a single amagmatic sedimentary basin (El Rito-Galisteo) trended northwest-southeast with Laramide basement uplifts on three sides; (2) early to late Oligocene (37-28 Ma): intermediate magmatism with volcaniclastic aprons derived from the San Juan and Ortiz-Cerrillos volcanic fields, and residual Laramide uplifts; (3) late Oligocene-early Miocene (28-21 Ma): initiation of bimodal volcanism with widely dispersed volcaniclastic aprons derived from the predominantly silicic San Juan and Latir volcanic fields; (4) early to middle Miocene (21-15 Ma): continued volcaniclastic dispersal from silicic volcanic centers, concurrent with initiation of block faulting to form half grabens, internal drainage, and erosion of Phanerozoic strata and Precambrian basement; (5) middle to late Miocene (15-8 Ma): continued deepening of half grabens, widespread exposure of Precambrian terranes, formation of complex depositional environments in basin centers, and continued bimodal volcanism; (6) late Miocene to present (8-0 Ma): concentration of extension in central grabens linked by accommodation zones, major bimodal volcanism (for example, Taos Plateau and Jemez Mountains), regional uplift, and integration of Rio Grande drainage. Dispersal patterns, petrofacies analysis, K-Ar ages, and chemical analyses of volcanic clasts provide details concerning three primary volcanic centers: (1) San Juan Mountains (27-29 m.y., high-K andesite and rhyodacite); (2) Latir volcanic field (25-28 m.y., high-K andesite and rhyolite); and (3) the previously unrecognized Servilleta Plaza center (22-23 m.y., latite, high-K andesite and rhyodacite), which may have been a southern extension of the Latir field. These three volcanic centers provided detritus to the following units, respectively: (1) Esquibel Mbr. of Los Pinos Fm., upper Abiquiu Fm., middle Picuris Fm., Bishops Lodge Mbr. of Tesuque Fm. and volcaniclastic units in the northern Albuquerque basin (Zia and Abiquiu); (2) Cordito Mbr. of Los Pinos Fm. and uppermost Abiquiu Fm.; and (3) Chama-El Rito Mbr. of Tesuque Fm and upper Picuris Fm. Use of petrofacies (1. Esquibel, 2. Cordito, and 3. Plaza) simplifies the chaos of stratigraphic nomenclature and promotes regional correlations of poorly exposed units.},

abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical model of flow and chemical transport processes in subterranean estuaries (unconfined brackish groundwater aquifers at the ocean-land interface). The model shows that groundwater circulation and oscillating flow, caused by wave setup and tide, may constitute up to 96% of submarine groundwater discharge (SGWD) compared with 4% due to the net groundwater discharge. While these local flow processes do not change the total amount of land-derived chemical input to the ocean over a long period (e.g., yearly), they induce fluctuations of the chemical transfer rate as the aquifer undergoes saltwater intrusion. This may result in a substantial increase in chemical fluxes to the ocean over a short period (e.g., monthly and by a factor of 20 above the averaged level), imposing a possible threat to the marine environment. These results are essentially consistent with the experimental findings of Moore 1996 and have important implications for coastal resources management.},

abstract = {Porosity and permeability generally decrease with increasing depth (thermal exposure and effective pressure); however, a significant number of deep (\textgreater4 km [approximately 13,000 ft]) sandstone reservoirs worldwide are characterized by anomalously high porosity and permeability. Anomalous porosity and permeability can be defined as being statistically higher than the porosity and permeability values occurring in typical sandstone reservoirs of a given lithology (composition and texture), age, and burial/temperature history. In sandstones containing anomalously high porosities, such porosities exceed the maximum porosity of the typical sandstone subpopulation. Major causes of anomalous porosity and permeability were identified decades ago; however, quantification of the effect of processes responsible for anomalous porosity and permeability and the assessment of the predictability of anomalous porosity and permeability occurrence in subsurface sandstones have rarely been addressed in published literature. The focus of this article is on quantification and predictability of three major causes of anomalously high porosity: (1) grain coats and grain rims, (2) early emplacement of hydrocarbons, and (3) shallow development of fluid overpressure. Grain coats and grain rims retard quartz cementation and concomitant porosity and permeability reduction by inhibiting precipitation of quartz overgrowths on detrital-quartz grains. Currently, prediction of anomalous porosity associated with grain coats and grain rims is dependent on the availability of empirical data sets. In the absence of adequate empirical data, sedimentologic and diagenetic models can be helpful in assessing risk due to reservoir quality. Such models provide a means to evaluate the effect of geologic constraints on coating occurrence and coating completeness required to preserve economically viable porosity and permeability in a given play or prospect. These constraints include thermal history and sandstone grain size and composition. The overall effect of hydrocarbon emplacement on reservoir quality is controversial. It appears that at least some cements (quartz and illite) may continue to precipitate following emplacement of hydrocarbons into the reservoir. Our work indicates that integration of basin modeling with reservoir quality modeling can be used to quantify, prior to drilling, the potential impact of hydrocarbon emplacement on porosity and permeability. The best-case scenario for significant reservoir quality preservation due to fluid overpressure development is in rapidly deposited Tertiary or Quaternary sandstones. Our models suggest that significant porosity can be preserved in sandstones that have experienced continuous high fluid overpressures from shallow burial depths. The models also indicate that the potential for porosity preservation is greatest in ductile-grain-rich sandstones because compaction tends to be the dominant control on reservoir quality in such rocks. The case for significant porosity preservation associated with fluid overpressures in pre-Tertiary basins, however, is more problematic because of the complexities in the history of fluid overpressure and the greater significance of quartz cementation as a potential mechanism of porosity loss.},

abstract = {Many recent studies of stress-triggered seismicity rely on a fault failure model with a single free parameter, the apparent coefficient of friction, presumed to be a material constant with possible values 0 less than or equal to mu' less than or equal to 1. These studies may present a misleading view of fault strength and the role of pore fluid pressure in earthquake failure. The parameter mu' is intended to incorporate the effects of both friction and pore pressure, but is a material constant only if changes in pore fluid pressure induced by changes in stress are proportional to the normal stress change across the potential failure plane. Although specific models of fault zones permit such a relation, neither is it known that fault zones within the Earth behave this way, nor is this behavior expected in all cases. In contrast, For an isotropic homogeneous poroelastic model the pore pressure changes are proportional to changes in mean stress, mu' is not a material constant, and -infinity less than or equal to mu' less than or equal to + infinity. Analysis of the change in Coulomb failure stress for tectonically loaded reverse and strike-slip faults shows considerable differences between these two pore pressure models, suggesting that such models might be distinguished from one another using observations of triggered seismicity (e.g., aftershocks). We conclude that using the constant apparent friction model exclusively in studies of Coulomb failure stress is unwise and could lead to significant errors in estimated stress change and seismic hazard.},

@article{Brodie1995,
abstract = {There is now general agreement that many sedimentary basins on the northwest continental shelf of Europe underwent permanent exhumation during the Tertiary. The most dramatic indicator of this process is the present-day absence of up to 3 km of anticipated post-rift subsidence in the midlands of Britain and in the East Irish Sea. Any explanation must take into account the fact that the entire shelf has very small, long wavelength, free-air gravity anomalies. This constraint is of fundamental importance and implies either that the crust has been thickened, that phase changes have occurred within the lithosphere, or that low density material has been added to the lithosphere. Tertiary epeirogenic uplift and exhumation is often attributed to horizontal shortening which is assumed to be related in a general sense to Alpine mountain building. However, the removal of 3 km of sediment from a basin, which was originally 100 km wide, requires 20-30 km of shortening. Whilst minor Tertiary shortening is observed all over the continental shelf, nowhere is it sufficient to account for the inferred amount of denudation. More significantly, exhumation is thought to have commenced in the Early Tertiary and dramatically increases from south to north. Shortening is generally younger (mid-Tertiary) and decreases in intensity from south to north. Here we argue that Tertiary uplift and denudation are a consequence of regional igneous underplating. At the beginning of the Tertiary, rifting associated with the initiation of the Iceland plume generated substantial volumes of melt. Petrological arguments and the results from inversion of rare earth element concentrations of MgO-rich igneous rocks suggest that a minimum of 2-5 km of melt were produced beneath a substantial part of the continental shelf. We infer that much of this melt was trapped within the lithosphere, presumably close to the Moho, which would have acted as a density filter. Such underplating will have caused rapid surface uplift whilst maintaining isostatic equilibrium. Simple calculations based on deep seismic reflection data and the high P-wave velocities observed beneath Scotland are consistent with the petrological arguments.},

abstract = {Motivated by the need to document and evaluate the types and variability of fault zone properties that potentially affect aquifer systems in basins of the middle Rio Grande rift, we systematically characterized structural and cementation properties of exposed fault zones at 176 sites in the northern Albuquerque Basin. A statistical analysis of measurements and observations evaluated four aspects of the fault zones: (1) attitude and displacement, (2) cement, (3) lithology of the host rock or sediment, and (4) character and width of distinctive structural architectural components at the outcrop scale. Three structural architectural components of the fault zones were observed: (1) outer damage zones related to fault growth; these zones typically contain deformation bands, shear fractures, and open extensional fractures, which strike subparallel to the fault and may promote ground-water flow along the fault zone; (2) inner mixed zones composed of variably entrained, disrupted, and dismembered blocks of host sediment; and (3) central fault cores that accommodate most shear strain and in which persistent low- permeability clay-rich rocks likely impede the flow of water across the fault. The lithology of the host rock or sediment influences the structure of the fault zone and the width of its components. Different grain-size distributions and degrees of induration of the host materials produce differences in material strength that lead to variations in width, degree, and style of fracturing and other fault-related deformation. In addition, lithology of the host sediment appears to strongly control the distribution of cement in fault zones. Most faults strike north to north-northeast and dip 55? - 77? east or west, toward the basin center. Most faults exhibit normal slip, and many of these faults have been reactivated by normal-oblique and strike slip. Although measured fault displacements have a broad range, from 0.9 to 4,000 m, most are <100 m, and fault zones appear to have formed mainly at depths less than 1,000 m. Fault zone widths do not exceed 40 m (median width = 15.5 m). The mean width of fault cores (0.1 m) is nearly one order of magnitude less than that of mixed zones (0.75 m) and two orders of magnitude less than that of damage zones (9.7 m). Cements, a proxy for localized flow of ancient ground water, are common along fault zones in the basin. Silica cements are limited to faults that are near and strike north to northwest toward the Jemez volcanic field north of the basin, whereas carbonate fault cements are widely distributed. Coarse sediments (gravel and sand) host the greatest concentrations of cement within fault zones. Cements fill some extension fractures and, to a lesser degree, are concentrated along shear fractures and deformation bands within inner damage zones. Cements are commonly concentrated in mixed zones and inner damage zones on one side of a fault and thus are asymmetrically distributed within a fault zone, but cement does not consistently lie on the basinward side of faults. From observed spatial patterns of asymmetrically distributed fault zone cements, we infer that ancient ground-water flow was commonly localized along, and bounded by, faults in the basin. It is apparent from our study that the Albuquerque Basin contains a high concentration of faults. The geometry of, internal structure of, and cement and clay distribution in fault zones have created and will continue to create considerable heterogeneity of permeability within the basin aquifers. The characteristics and statistical range of fault zone features appear to be predictable and consistent throughout the basin; this predictability can be used in ground-water flow simulations that consider the influence of faults.},

abstract = {The landscapes of the Near East show both the first settlements and the longest trajectories of settlement systems. Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites—spanning eight millennia—at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km2 area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places—the latter of which are often referred to as “tells”—we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record. },

Two of the samples are stochastic reconstructions with the same porosity, specific surface area, and two-point correlation function as the Fontainebleau sample. The fourth sample is a physical model that mimics the processes of sedimentation, compaction, and diagenesis of Fontainebleau sandstone. The permeabilities of these samples are determined by numerically solving at low Reynolds numbers the appropriate Stokes equations in the pore spaces of the samples. The physical diagenesis model appears to reproduce the permeability of the real sandstone sample quite accurately, while the permeabilities of the stochastic reconstructions deviate from the latter by at least an order of magnitude. This finding confirms earlier qualitative predictions based on local porosity theory. Two numerical algorithms were used in these simulations. One is based on the lattice-Boltzmann method, and the other on conventional finite-difference techniques. The accuracy of these two methods is discussed and compared, also with experiment.},

abstract = {Temperature is one of the key parameters controlling lithospheric and mantle dynamics and rheology. Using recent experimental data on elastic parameters and anelasticity, we obtain models of temperature at 50 to 200 km depth beneath Europe from the global P wave velocity model of Bijwaard et al. [1998] and the regional S wave velocity model of Marquering and Snieder [1996]. Forward modeling of seismic velocity allows us to assess the sensitivity of velocity to various parameters. In the depth range of interest, variations in temperature (when below the solidus) yield the largest effects. For a 100 °C increase in temperature, a decrease of 0.5–2% in VP and 0.7–4.5% in VS is predicted, where the strongest decrease is due to the large effect of anelasticity at high temperature. The effect of composition is expected to give velocity anomalies \textless1% for the shallow mantle and would therefore be difficult to resolve. At depths \textgreater80 km the relative amplitudes of the European VP and VS anomalies are consistent with a thermal origin. At shallower depths, variations in crustal thickness and possibly the presence of partial melt appear to have an additional effect, mainly on S wave velocity. In regions where both P and S anomalies are well-resolved, VP- and VS-derived thermal models agree well with each other and with temperatures determined from surface heat flow observations. Furthermore, the thermal models are consistent with known tectonics. The inferred temperatures vary significantly, from around 400 °C below an average mantle adiabat at 100 km depth under the Russian Platform and a 300 °C increase from east to west across the Tornquist-Teisseyre zone to temperatures around the mantle adiabat in the depth range 50–200 km under areas with present surface volcanism. In spite of the uncertainties in the calculation of temperatures due to uncertainties in the experimental elastic parameters and anelasticity and uncertainties associated with tomographic imaging, we find that the tomographic models of the shallow mantle under Europe can yield useful estimates of the thermal structure.},

abstract = {Variable density ground water flow models are rarely used to estimate submarine ground water discharge because of limitations in computer speed, data availability, and availability of a simulation tool that can minimize numerical dispersion. This paper presents an application of the SEAWAT code, which is a combined version of MODFLOW and MT3D, to estimate rates of submarine ground water discharge to a coastal marine estuary. Discharge rates were estimated for Biscayne Bay, Florida, for the period from January 1989 to September 1998 using a three-dimensional, variable density ground water flow and transport model. Hydrologic stresses in the 10-layer model include recharge, evapotranspiration, ground water withdrawals from municipal wellfields, interactions with surface water (canals in urban areas and wetlands in the Everglades), boundary fluxes, and submarine ground water discharge to Biscayne Bay. The model was calibrated by matching ground water levels in monitoring wells, baseflow to canals, and the position of the 1995 salt water intrusion line. Results suggest that fresh submarine ground water discharge to Biscayne Bay may have exceeded surface water discharge during the 1989, 1990, and 1991 dry seasons, but the average discharge for the entire simulation period was only ∼10% of the surface water discharge to the bay. Results from the model also suggest that tidal canals intercept fresh ground water that might otherwise have discharged directly to Biscayne Bay. This application demonstrates that regional scale variable density models are potentially useful tools for estimating rates of submarine ground water discharge.},

abstract = {We synthesized published data on the erosion of the Alpine foreland basin and apatite fi ssion-track ages from the Alps to infer the erosional sediment budget history for the past 5 m.y. The data reveal that erosion of the Alpine foreland basin is highest in front of the western Alps (between 2 and 0.6 km) and decreases eastward over a distance of 700 km to the Austrian foreland basin ($\sim$200 m). For the western Alps, erosion rates are >0.6 km/m.y., while erosion rates for the eastern foreland basin and the adjacent eastern Alps are <0.1 km/m.y., except for a small-scale signal in the Tauern Window. The results yield a large ellipsoidal, orogen-crossing pattern of erosion, centered along the western Alps. We suggest that accelerated erosion of the western Alps and their foreland basin occurred in response to regional-scale surface uplift, related to lithospheric unloading of the Eurasian slab along the Eurasian-Adriatic plate boundary. While we cannot rule out recent views that global climate change led to substantial erosion of the European Alps since 5 Ma, we postulate that regional-scale tectonic processes have driven erosion during this time, modulated by an increased erosional fl ux in response to Quaternary glaciations.},

abstract = {The presence of weak phyllosilicates may explain the low shear strengths of fault zones if they define well-developed fabrics. The growth of phyllosilicates is favored in meteoric water-dominated granitic fault systems, where mineral-aqueous fluid equilibria predict that modal phyllosilicate will increase via feldspar replacement reactions. In deeper, more alkaline, rockdominated regimes, the reactions reverse, and feldspars tend to replace phyllosilicates. In Mg-rich mafic rocks, however, phyllosilicates (chlorite, biotite) can replace stronger framework and chain silicates in both shallower (<&#8764;10 km) meteoric H2O-dominated and in deeper, alkaline, rock-dominated regimes. Where these phyllosilicates precipitate in active fault zones, they contribute directly to reaction softening. Because low-temperature deformation of phyllosilicates is not governed by factional processes alone but can occur by pressure-independent dislocation glide, the strength of phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks can be low at all depths. Low strain rate creep during interseismic periods can align phyllosilicate grains in foliated gouge and phyllonites. Where preferred orientations are strong and contiguity of phyllosilicates is large, strengths of rocks within fault zones may approach minimum strengths defined by single phyllosilicate crystals. Fault zones containing localized high concentrations of phyllosilicates with strong preferred orientations in well-defined folia can exhibit aseismic slip, especially where mafic Mg-rich rocks occur along the fault (like parts of the San Andreas Fault).},

The fluid phase distribution and transport of fluid in rocks strongly depend on the rheological conditions. In the lithologically heterogeneous crust changes in rheological regime can produce quite complex sandwich-like fluid transport layering, including domains of upward migration, very impermeable layers, or thin reservoirs with nearly horizontal fluid transport.In the present study two, two-dimensional thermal models of the stable continental crust with different spatial configurations of fluid systems have been calculated. The results show that such systems redistribute heat in the crust and give rise to zones of concentrated heat energy storage and transfer. The pattern of the disturbances to the conductive heat flow depends on the arrangement of the fluid systems (which is a function of the crustal structure, temperature and regional stress field) and shows significant lateral and vertical variations. Even at very low velocities of the fluid percolation (a few millimetres per year) the disturbances to the conductive heat flow may reach 30-60%.},

abstract = {The base of Earth's critical zone (CZ) is commonly shielded from study by many meters of overlying rock and regolith. Though deep CZ processes may seem far removed from the surface, they are vital in shaping it, preparing rock for infusion into the biosphere and breaking Earth materials down for transport across landscapes. This special issue highlights outstanding challenges and recent advances of deep CZ research in a series of articles that we introduce here in the context of relevant literature dating back to the 1500s. Building on several contributions to the special issue, we highlight four exciting new hypotheses about factors that drive deep CZ weathering and thus influence the evolution of life-sustaining CZ architecture. These hypotheses have emerged from recently developed process-based models of subsurface phenomena including: fracturing related to subsurface stress fields; weathering related to drainage of bedrock under hydraulic head gradients; rock damage from frost cracking due to subsurface tem-perature gradients; and mineral reactions with reactive fluids in subsurface chemical potential gradients. The models predict distinct patterns of subsurface weathering and CZ thickness that can be compared with observations from drilling, sampling and geophysical imaging. We synthesize the four hypotheses into an overarching conceptual model of fracturing and weathering that occurs as Earth materials are exhumed to the surface across subsurface gradients in stress, hydraulic head, temperature, and chemical potential. We conclude with a call for a coordinated measurement campaign designed to comprehensively test the four hypotheses across a range of climatic, tectonic and geologic conditions.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 83201393 Spatial variations in the salinity of pore waters in sedimentary basins can provide important insight into basin-scale hydrogeologic processes. Although there have been numerous studies of brine seeps in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, much less is known about porewater salinities in the vast areas between seeps. A study has been made of spatial variation in pore water salinities in sediments in an approximately 500�km by 200�km area of the northern deep water (water depth >500�m) Gulf of Mexico sedimentary basin (GOM) to provide insight into pathways and mechanisms of solute transport in this portion of the basin. A second objective was to document salinities in the upper 500�m of the sedimentary section, the approximate depth to which methane hydrates, a potential future energy resource, may be stable. Elevated salinities would reduce the P2013T stability range of hydrates. Salinities were calculated from borehole logs using a dual electrical conductivity model. Even though much of the northern GOM is underlain by allochthonous salt most of the undisturbed shallow sedimentary section has not been permeated by hypersaline waters. These waters are limited to areas near brine seeps. Hypersaline waters having salinities in excess of 100�g�l22121 become more common at subseafloor depths of 2�km and greater. A field study at Green Canyon 65 and published numerical simulations of fluid flow above tabular salt bodies suggest that brines produced by salt dissolution migrate laterally and pond above salt and/or within minibasins and that the dominant mechanism of vertical solute transport is a combination of compaction-driven advection and diffusion, not large-scale thermohaline overturn. Superimposed on this diffuse upward flux of dissolved salt is the more focused and localized expulsion of saline fluids up faults.},

abstract = {Earthquakes and vertical land movements inferred from geodetic levelling results demonstrate that the Netherlands is situated on a tectonically active part of the Earth's surface. Tectonic subsidence analyses of the sedimentary records in the basins and the history of tectonic uplift inferred from Meuse river terraces show that the current tectonic activity is part of a deformation phase which began in the late Early Miocene, which we take as the start of the neotectonic period. The neotectonic faulting mode is normal-slip. This is in accordance with the present-day orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, and the vertical orientation of the maximum stress. However, the neotectonic fault zones are reactivated Variscan or older wrench faults. These faults have been reactivated repeatedly during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic in normal and wrenching modes, and therefore represent fundamental crustal weakness zones. As a result, the surficial neotectonic fault pattern resembles the inherited wrenching fault pattern, although the faulting mode is normal-slip. This is illustrated for the area where normal faults have displaced the Meuse fluvial terrace system in the southeastern part of the Netherlands.The neotectonic vertical motions in and around the Roer Valley Rift System have affected the courses of the Rhine and Meuse rivers from Pliocene times until the present. In addition, a fluvial terrace staircase developed along the Meuse river in response to the uplift of the Ardennes-Rhenish Massif and its foreland, for example near Maastricht. Furthermore, small fault scarps are present along segments of the bounding fault zones of the Roer Valley Graben: the Peel Boundary Fault Zone and the Feldbiss Fault Zone. In other parts of the Netherlands the neotectonic vertical motions have no direct expression in the morphology. Examples of possible indirect control on the morphology in these areas occur in glacial landscapes, the Zuiderzee Basin and the coastal zone.},

Outcrop data show that fault displacement/thickness ratios and permeability vary widely. For simple single fault models, results for numerical models are compared with analytical and statistical methods. Representation of a fault as a transmissibility surface conflates the effects of four variables--fault zone thickness and permeability, grid-block size and matrix (host-rock) cell permeability. Random spatial variation of transmissibility factor values is well represented by a uniform transmissibility factor which is the arithmetic mean of the values representing log-normally distributed permeability and thicknesses. Realistic ranges of fault zone thicknesses can be represented without grid-block refinement by an upscaling method based on simple transformation of transmissibility factor curves derived from a range of coarse grid-block models. Sub-seismic faults have significant effects on effective permeability of model volumes at kilometre scales only when the faults are assigned a permeability less than c. 0.001 of the matrix permeability.},

abstract = {We argue that the observed conduit-barrier behavior of fault zones in siliciclastic sedimentary aquifer systems can be understood by considering a strongly anisotropic hydraulic structure in the fault. Hydraulic anisotropy in the fault is expected from a variety of mechanisms including clay-smearing, drag of sand, grain re-orientation and vertical segmentation of the fault plane. In this paper, we present an algorithm to predict fault zone width, lithological heterogeneity and hydraulic anisotropy. Estimation of these parameters is based upon the amount of fault throw and the clay-content of the lithologies flanking the fault zone. A suite of steady-state flow models are presented using an idealized stratigraphy consisting of alternating clay and sand-rich layers that are offset by a fault zone. These conceptual simulations show the impact of a fault zone on shallow (\textless500 m) fluid flow patterns and solute transport for different scenarios of fault throw. Fault width varies along the fault zone and increases from an average width of 2 m for a throw of 50 m to 8 m for a throw of 200 m. Hydraulic anisotropy in the fault zone in these scenarios is predicted to range between two to three orders of magnitude. Our results show that faults can form a preferential path way between aquifers at different depths over vertical distances of several hundreds of meters (that are otherwise separated by confining units) when fault permeability is strongly anisotropic. However, in the same scenario anomalously high hydraulic head gradients across the fault would still suggest that they act as an effective barrier to lateral groundwater flow. This has important implications for the assessment of the risk of a spread of contaminated groundwater or the reconstruction of hydrocarbon migration within sedimentary basins.},

Calculated circulation depths of up to 4.8 km are consistent with models for hydrothermal ore deposits that invoke the mixing of mineralizing fluids with sulphur-rich meteoric water at depth. Mass-flux calculations indicate that a relatively small spring (5 L/s) can transport large amounts of bacterially reduced sulphur to ore-forming depths over a short geological time scale and can easily account for the sulphur associated with Pb-Zn deposits in the southern Canadian Cordillera.

Smear along these faults is typically associated with thick (tens of metres) shale source layers and fault segments that are slightly offset, where the overlap between the segments creates an extensional dip relay. It is demonstrated that rock types other than shale, such as coal, siltstones and carbonates, may smear and thereby contribute to the low- permeable fault gouge. A critical threshold for the shale smear factor (SSF), given by the fault throw divided by the thickness of the shale source layer, is established to separate continuous and discontinuous smears. An SSF [&le;]4 is likely to correspond to a continuous smear along large faults and thereby to a sealing membrane on the fault surface. For small (subseismic) faults, a continuous smear can be maintained for both shale and coal source layers for much higher smear factors compared with large faults. The continuity of smear associated with small faults also displays a greater variation (SSF in the range of 1-50), to become less predictable than smear along large faults.},

abstract = {Freshwater discharge from the continents is a key component of Earth's water cycle that sustains human life and ecosystem health. Surprisingly, owing to a number of socioeconomic and political obstacles, a comprehensive global river discharge observing system does not yet exist. Here we use 13 years (1994-2006) of satellite precipitation, evaporation, and sea level data in an ocean mass balance to estimate freshwater discharge into the global ocean. Results indicate that global freshwater discharge averaged 36,055 km(3)/y for the study period while exhibiting significant interannual variability driven primarily by El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation cycles. The method described here can ultimately be used to estimate long-term global discharge trends as the records of sea level rise and ocean temperature lengthen. For the relatively short 13-year period studied here, global discharge increased by 540 km(3)/y(2), which was largely attributed to an increase of global-ocean evaporation (768 km(3)/y(2)). Sustained growth of these flux rates into long-term trends would provide evidence for increasing intensity of the hydrologic cycle.},

abstract = {The mutual exchange of water between lakes and contigruous permeable ground-water bodies, which are thin relative to the diameter of the lakes, was modeled digitally.  A significant rate of seepage was found to extend only a relatively short distance from shore, thus forming a narrow band around the lake's perimeter.  This near-shore concentration of seepage is an effect only of the geometry of the ground-water flow system, which is governed by the geometry of the body of permeable material, the spatial distribution of permeability within it, and the form of the water table.  Near-shore seepage occurs independently of the presence of fine-grained, low-permeability sedimentary bottom materials in the central part of the lake.  Digital modleing indicates that the velocity of seepage generally decreases at an exponential rate as a function of distance from shore.  Field measurements of seepage rates through the bottom of Lake Sallie, west-central Minnesota, confirm the model results by deomnstrating that both the near-shore seepage band and the exponential decrease in seepage velocity acutally exist.},

abstract = {A multiproxy approach is applied to reconstructing accurately the Weichselian Pleniglacial climate (72-13 ka) in northwestern and central Europe. Standardised translations are used to transform proxy data into climate parameter values for six characteristic time windows. Quantitative reconstructions of the temperature regime are derived from periglacial, Coleoptera and botanical evidence, while aeolian and fluvial evidence provide qualitative information on wind activity and precipitation respectively.The Early Pleniglacial (74-59 ka), the cold period between 41-38 ka and the Late Pleniglacial (27-13 ka) are characterised by a strong north to south climatic gradient over northwestern Europe. During the last-glacial maximum discontinuous permafrost was established in northern France, whereas the continuous permafrost zone extended from the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and Poland to the nordic ice sheets. Prominent wind activity and a relatively low precipitation typify these periods. In contrast, an indistinct west to east climate gradient was present in the relatively more temperate intervals (e.g. 50-41 ka). Seasonally frozen ground conditions prevailed in northwestern Europe whereas discontinuous permafrost may be suggested for central Germany.It appears that the climate conditions in northwest and central Europe were controlled by three major factors: the Scandinavian ice sheet, the North Atlantic surface water (circulation) and the Russian continent. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In this relatively uniform fluid quartz cements grew and developed complex cathodoluminescence (CL) zonations.

abstract = {Quantitative understanding of variability in weathering fluxes on the modern Earth is limited because little is known about where the most important weathering reactions take place. This is partly because the locus of weathering is difficult to measure empirically. Inverse analysis of a parametric model presented here provides first-order constraints on variability in the thickness of the zone of active weathering. Results suggest that the effective thickness of the weathering zone varies relatively little across several orders of magnitude of denudation rate. At low to moderate denudation rates, reactions in soils may dominate weathering fluxes at the catchment scale, but the contribution from soil weathering decreases at higher denudation rates. Consequently, increased erosion leads to higher weathering fluxes, sustained by progressively greater contributions from weathering in bedrock. The effect of climate (temperature and runoff) on weathering fluxes is apparently weaker at low denudation rates than at high denudation rates, such that erosion, and potentially associated bedrock weathering, may be important for maintaining climate-stabilizing feedbacks in Earth's carbon cycle.},

abstract = {Estimations of porosity and permeability from well logs are important yet difficult tasks encountered in geophysical formation evaluation and reservoir engineering. Motivated by recent results of artificial neural network (ANN) modelling offshore eastern Canada, we have developed neural nets for converting well logs in the North Sea to porosity and permeability. We use two separate back-propagation ANNs (BP-ANNs) to model porosity and permeability. The porosity ANN is a simple three-layer network using sonic, density and resistivity logs for input. The permeability ANN is slightly more complex with four inputs (density, gamma ray, neutron porosity and sonic) and more neurons in the hidden layer to account for the increased complexity in the relationships. The networks, initially developed for basin-scale problems, perform sufficiently accurately to meet normal requirements in reservoir engineering when applied to Jurassic reservoirs in the Viking Graben area. The mean difference between the predicted porosity and helium porosity from core plugs is less than 0.01 fractional units. For the permeability network a mean difference of approximately 400 mD is mainly due to minor core-log depth mismatch in the heterogeneous parts of the reservoir and lack of adequate overburden corrections to the core permeability. A major advantage is that no a priori knowledge of the rock material and pore fluids is required. Real-time conversion based on measurements while drilling (MWD) is thus an obvious application.},

abstract = {We can deduce thermal conductivities and thermal gradients from extensively available oil exploration data: geophysical well logs, cores, cuttings, formation thicknesses and temperatures. Thermal conductivity is predicted at three significant scales. First, it is computed at the scale of well-log electrofacies (thicknesses from 1 to 10 m) using a geometric mean model calibrated on laboratory measurements made on the main sedimentary rocks—the electrofacies conductivity is calculated as a function of the mineralogy, the porosity and the saturating fluids. Second, it is estimated at formation scale at each well site (thicknesses from 100 to a few thousand meters) using a serial model that accounts for the anisotropy due to sediment stacking and for temperature effects. Finally, for each formation (thicknesses on the order of 1 km), the average conductivity field is mapped at basin scale (extent on the order of 100 km) using a geostatistical treatment accounting for lateral facies and/or porosity changes. For thermal gradient field reconstruction, the systematic errors associated with the drilling history are removed from temperatures (bottom-hole temperatures) using various techniques depending on data quality. The formation thermal gradient fields are then estimated using a stochastic inversion for temperatures and thicknesses, considering lateral correlations between thermal gradients at well sites. The technique is applied to the Norwegian Viking Graben, a multistage rift basin in the North Sea, where previous studies indicate large lateral and vertical variations in thermal conductivity and thermal gradient fields.},

abstract = {Numeric modeling of the climate system at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary has produced surprising results concerning the hydrological cycle during the Late Cretaceous. Today; the global average of subsurface runoff (groundwater, 13.320 km3) to surface runoff (43.790 km3) is about 30%. Globally, about⅔ of the total river discharge entering the sea today is from surface runoff, much of it originating as snowmelt, and⅓ is from groundwater, The present day data show similar proportions of surface runoff/subsurface runoff for different continents, 4:1 in Aus-tralia, 3:1 in Europe, Africa, and South America, and lower on other continents. The amount and seasonal distribution of surface runoff drives both mechanical erosion and terrigenous bio-logical activity. The amount and distribution of subsurface runoff is of importance for chemical erosion and subsurface dissolution. GENESIS (v.2.0) paleoclimate simulations of the Late Cretaceous, show a relation opposite to that of present, with subsurface runoff dominating over surface runoff both globally and region-ally. Globally, the simulations produce an annual mean value for subsurface runoff about 6 times higher than that of the surface runoff. Detailed examination of the data shows very large regional differences. The ratios of surface to subsurface runoff range from 1:2 (Sevier Highlands of west-ern North America) to 1:1200 (S-Asia). There are significant regional differences between the surface runoff and subsurface runoff, even at similar paleolatitudes. Not only does the total amount of water transported annually by these two mechanisms change dramatically, but their distribution during the course of a year is different from present. In addition to the effect of the different Cretaceous hydrology on rivers, low salinity, nutrient-rich groundwater discharge di-rectly into coastal waters could have had a significant impact on the local ecology along the margins of continents and islands. If atmospheric CO2 were also higher, as assumed in the pa-leoclimate simulation, the acidity of rainwater would also have been higher, ultimately affecting chemical erosion rates. These results were unexpected because the climate model uses a globally fixed vegetation model (after DORMAN &SELLERS, 1989 {\`{a}} “Type 6” broadleaf trees with groundcover {\`{a}} savanna) and a fixed soil module (sand: 51%; silt: 29%; clay: 20%). Therefore, in these simula-tions the climate system alone is responsible for the ratio and distribution between surface runoff and subsurface runoff. More realistic globally varying vegetation and soils would moderate the results, but would not reverse the general conclusion that rivers were very different in a green-house world.},

abstract = {Observations of GeV heavy ion and MeV cluster-ion tracks in crystalline solids give us new insight into registration physics. Thermal and ion explosion spikes no longer compete; a ‘compound spike' accounts for both. Ion explosion dominates for surface tracks (electronic sputtering). And there can also be transient plasma stopping in the bulk. For clusters there are ‘vicinage effects'—both electronic and nuclear—which can influence track dimensions and structure. Displacement cascades in large energetic clusters may lead to projectile “fission” and coherent flow into sub-tracks. The absence of tracks in certain targets, and their size/structure in others, leads to a model of projectile assisted prompt anneal (PAPA) in ∼10−11s, either partial or complete, often by swift epitaxy, on elemental lattices (e.g. silicon) or on compound sublattices (e.g. fluorite). Phase transformations are important, but simple target amorphization is rare—the exception, not the rule. For many targets the thermal spike (macroscopic) fails, since ‘point' defects (atomistic) characteristic of the target, their motion, and the electronic band structure, determine latent track detail. Circumstances in which the Bragg Rule of Additivity fails completely are revealed, and the kinetic threshold for constructive phase transitions in tracks described. This same track physics applies generally also to geothermometry—the opposite time extremum (∼10+11s)—where annealing is due to defect assisted delayed anneal (DADA). Differences between etching rates of induced and spontaneous fission tracks can be explained. The geothermobarometric “Wendt/Vidal effect” (2002)—combined pressure, temperature and stress (with time) influences on fission track annealing (in e.g. apatite)—is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {A study of the radiogenic and atmospherically derived inert gases in groundwaters from the Bunter Sandstone aquifer of Nottinghamshire, England, is described. The radiogenic gases, 222Rn and 4He, are derived by decay of the radioelements contained in the aquifer. The relationship between radioelement content of the rock and groundwater 222Rn and 4He contents is discussed. An increase in the dissolved 4He content with groundwater age is demonstrated and correlated with 14C ages. Excess 4He ages calculated from average physical properties and radioelement contents of the aquifer rock are greater than the corrected 14C ages and possible explanations for this are discussed.  The dissolved Ar and Kr contents of the groundwaters indicate their temperature of air equilibration in the unsaturated zone at recharge. The recharge temperatures for groundwaters of age greater than 2{\textperiodcentered}104 yr. are 5–7°C lower than those for waters recharged in the last 104 yr. This is shown to be consistent with the palaeoclimatic record for England during the late Pleistocene.},

abstract = {Replacement dolomites may continue to recrystallize in the presence of subsequent diagenetic and hydrothermal fluids. During recrystallization, they can change both their solid geochemistry and that of their included fluids (by releasing older fluids and entrapping younger fluids). Thus it may be possible to decipher a complex fluid history by analyzing both the composition of the dolomite ($\delta$18O, 87Sr/86Sr) and its contained fluids (Cl/Br), as the former reflects temperature and/or fluid-rock interactions, whereas the latter reflects salinity source regions of the last fluid to affect the dolomite. Applying this approach to the Bonneterre Dolomite of southeast Missouri, which hosts the world-class Viburnum Trend Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) Pb-Zn district, reveals the presence of two geochemically distinct types of brines whose influence varied temporally during the Bonneterre's history of dolomitization and ore deposition. A plot of Cl/Br molar ratios of included fluids versus 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the enclosing dolomite indicates distinct salinity sources for early (halite dissolution) and later (extreme evaporation of seawater) dolomitizing brines.Comparison with fluids in ore sulfides may permit us to relate replacement dolomites to ore-forming events. Early-stage copper- and zinc-bearing sulfides ($\delta$34S $\sim$0‰) have fluids with Cl/Br molar ratios (150–1,050) reflecting a similar importance of halite-dissolving brine during ore deposition. Main-stage cuboctahedral galena ($\delta$34S $\sim$15‰) has fluids with Cl/Br molar ratios (<100–400) similar to extremely evaporated seawater brines responsible for late replacement dolomites. We suggest that resident brines, which gained salinity (in part through halite dissolution), sulfur, and metals from local sedimentary and igneous rocks, were important for early replacement dolomitization and Early-stage ore deposition. This fluid type was supplanted by later, Main-stage brines that acquired salinity (through seawater evaporation) and metals in a more distal, basinal setting. Late-stage, vug-filling cubic galena records a renewed importance of the halite-dissolving brine as the influence of the more distal basinal brine waned. Halogen-sulfur isotope systematics of sulfides indicate that fluid mixing likely was a dominant ore-depositing mechanism during all stages of ore mineralization in the Viburnum Trend.},

abstract = {Measurements of dispersed vitrinite along several exploration wells within the northern Rhinegraben are indicative of a thermal graben history that is influenced by a combination of basal conductive and groundwater-flow related convective heat transfer. To determine the conductive/convective components of heat transfer within the rift today, a series of 2D numerical groundwater flow and heat models are developed along a cross-sectional transect across the northern Rhinegraben. Fault zone permeability is varied in the simulations of these models to determine the possible fluid pathways and the effects of circulating groundwater on the graben temperature field. Depending on the fault permeability, negative thermal anomalies always develop in areas of cold recharging groundwater along the graben flanks regardless of fault permeability, whereas hot discharging groundwater near the topographic low of the graben only results in positive thermal anomalies under the assumption of high fault permeability. Simulation results suggest that the modern groundwater flow system has an overall net cooling effect on the temperature field of the rift.Without convective cooling by groundwater, vitrinite reflectance levels in wells would be expected to be much higher on average than are observed. Although relatively high heat flow densities (100 mW/m2) are documented in the Rhinegraben, an average of only 65 mW/m2 would be sufficient to produce the observed vitrinite reflectance levels. Thus, a long-lived (\textgreater10 My) cooling convective fluid flow in combination with a high basal heat flow seems to be active.},

abstract = {The mechanical feasibility of focusing both surface- and basinal-derived fluids towards sites of iron ore genesis during Proterozoic deformation in the Hamersley Province is tested here by computer simulation. Finite difference modelling of porous media flow during extensional deformation of a mountain range shows that surface fluids are drawn towards areas of failure and focus into the centre of the mountain. The addition of permeable structures such as a normal fault provides focused fluid pathways in which mechanical and geological conditions are particularly conducive to both upward and downward flow. Upward flow from the base of the fault within the model overall is favoured by low permeability basement materials and supra-hydrostatic pore pressures. Downward migration of fluids becomes more prominent as extension progresses and upward fluid flow from the base diminishes. The introduction of sedimentary layering into the models allows lateral fluid flow, such that sites of potential fluid mixing may then occur within permeable iron formation units close to the fault zone. Allowing parts of the stratigraphy to become more permeable as a function of high fluid flux simulates permeability enhancement by silica dissolution as a mechanism for iron ore genesis. The involvement of both basinal and surficial fluids in the genesis of the ore deposits is supported by the mechanical models and in addition provides an explanation for a progression from relatively reduced to oxidised conditions at the Mt Tom Price deposit (and possibly other large deposits) with time. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Cretaceous and Tertiary post-rift subsidence history of the northern North Sea and the Faeroe-Shetland Basins, formed by Jurassic and Cretaceous rifting, show substantial departures from McKenzie post-rift subsidence in the Early Tertiary. These departures can be explained by regional Palaeocene uplift, followed by rapid decay of this uplift in the Eocene through to the present day. Forward and reverse 2-D modelling of syn- and post-rift stratigraphy, using flexural isostasy, has been used to determine the magnitude and timing of this uplift event. In the north Sea Basin (NNSB), modelling predicts Palaeocene uplift to have been of the order of 375-525 m, increasing northwards. In the Faeroe-Shetland Basin, Palaeocene uplift is estimated to have been 900 m. The timing of Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB and northern Britain is consistent with the development of the Early Tertiary Icelandic plume (c. 64 Ma) or a related plume. Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB is attributed to dynamic uplift generated by mantle fluid flow driven by ascending hot plume material. Magmatic underplating or buoyancy from heated lithosphere are not believed to be significant mechanisms for regional Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB. The decay of Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB occurs more rapidly than predicted by simple conductive cooling of heated lithosphere. Rapid decay of uplift in the NNSB is attributed to a temperature decrease of the plume in the Early Eocene (c. 55 Ma), resulting in a decrease in dynamic uplift, and coincides with a decrease in volcanic activity within the British Tertiary and Greenland Igneous Provinces, and the initiation of sea-floor spreading between Greenland and northwest Europe. The plume responsible for Palaeocene uplift in the NNSB and northern Britain may have been located in the Faeroe-East Greenland area, although a smaller transient plume within the British Tertiary Igneous Province may also have contributed to uplift.},

@article{Muchez1994,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Upper Visean limestones in the Campine Basin of northern Belgium are intensively fractured. The largest and most common fractures are cemented by non-ferroan, dull brown-orange luminescent blocky calcite. First melting temperatures of fluid inclusions in these calcites are around -57oC, suggesting that precipitation of the cements occurred from NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2 fluids. The final melting temperatures (Tmice) are between -5 and -33oC. The broad range in the Tmice data can be explained by the mixing of high salinity fluids with meteoric waters, but other hypotheses may also be valid. Homogenization temperatures from blocky calcite cements in the shelf limestones are interpreted to have formed between 45 and 75oC. In carbonates which were deposited close to and at the shelf margin, precipitation temperatures were possibly in the range 70-85oC and 72-93oC, respectively. On the shelf, the calcites have a delta18O around -9.3% PDB and they are interpreted to have grown in a fluid with a delta18O between -3.5 and +1.0% SMOW. At the shelf margin, blocky calcites (delta18O - 13.5% PDB) could have precipitated from a fluid with a delta18O betweenn -4.0 and -1.1% SMOW. The highest oxygen isotopic compositions are comparable to those of Late Carboniferous marine fluids (delta18O= - 1% SMOW). The lowest values are more positive than a previously reported composition for Carboniferous meteoric waters (delta18O= -7% SMOW). Precipitation is likely to have occurred in marine-derived fluids, which mixed with meteoric waters sourced from near the Brabant Massif. Fluids with a similar negative oxygen isotopic composition and high salinity are actually present in Palaeozoic formations. The higher temperature range in the limestones near the shelf margin is explained by the upward migration of fluids from the 'basinal' area along fractures and faults into the shelf.},

Relations for apparent longitudinal and transverse dispersivity are developed through an analytical solution for dispersion in a fluctuating, quasi-steady uniform flow field, in which storativity is zero. For transient flow, spatial moments are evaluated from numerical solutions. Ignored or unknown transients in the direction of flow primarily act to increase the apparent transverse dispersivity because the longitudinal dispersivity is acting in a direction that is not the assumed flow direction. This increase is a function of the angle between the transient flow vector and the assumed steady state flow direction and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity. The maximum effect on transverse dispersivity occurs if storativity is assumed to be zero, such that the flow field responds instantly to boundary condition changes.},

The terrestrial groundwater flux was the same order of magnitude as the local river discharge in July 2009. Shelf-water total alkalinity (TAlk) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations could not be explained by river inputs alone, suggesting a groundwater source. We estimated SGD fluxes of TAlk and DIC using the SGD flux derived from a shelf-water 226Ra budget and TAlk and DIC concentration differences between the groundwater and seawater. These fluxes were also determined by the observed TAlk : 226Ra and DIC : 226Ra relationships in the shelf water, and the 226Ra flux sustained by SGD. These TAlk and DIC fluxes were 11–71 times more than the combined input of local rivers, suggesting that SGD was the dominant source of TAlk and DIC to the SWFS during 2009.

Generally, hydrothermal circulation, near-surface geothermal activity, and magmatic intrusion should be closely tied in time and space. Long-lived ( approximately 1 m.y.) hydrothermal activity normally suggests multiple pulses of intrusion with associated pulses of hydrothermal circulation. However, if the permeability of the intruded environment is just above that which allows convection, and the volume of the intrusion is very large, calculations presented here show that a single episode of intrusion can sustain hydrothermal circulation and near-surface geothermal activity for approximately 800,000 yr. For a deep sill heat source, these unusually long-lived hydrothermal systems can vent through a few very widely separated discharge sites and have the potential to produce isolated massive sulfide deposits of unusually large size.},

We estimated SGD fluxes of TAlk and DIC using the SGD flux derived from a shelf-water 226Ra budget and TAlk and DIC concentration differences between the groundwater and seawater. These fluxes were also determined by the observed TAlk : 226Ra and DIC : 226Ra relationships in the shelf water, and the 226Ra flux sustained by SGD. These TAlk and DIC fluxes were 11–71 times more than the combined input of local rivers, suggesting that SGD was the dominant source of TAlk and DIC to the SWFS during 2009.

abstract = {The Recharge Area Concept is the proposition that in Canadian-Shield type natural environments recharge areas of regional groundwater flow systems are superior for high-level nuclear waste repositories to other types of groundwater flow regimes, especially to areas of groundwater discharge. This conclusion is reached from an analysis of basinal groundwater flow models. The calculations were made for a two-dimensional flank of a fully saturated topographic basin, 20 km long and 4 km deep, in which groundwater is driven by gravity. Variants of hydraulic-conductivity distributions were considered: 1) homogeneous; 2) stratified; and 3) stratified-faulted. The faults' attitudes were changed by steps from vertical to horizontal for different variants. The model is assumed conceptually to represent the crystalline-rock environment of the Canadian Shield. The hydrogeologic performances of hypothetical repositories placed 500 m deep in the recharge and discharge areas were characterized by thirteen parameters. The principal advantages of recharge- over discharge-area locations are: 1) longer travel paths and return-flow times from repository to surface; 2) robustness of predicted values of performance parameters; 3) field-verifiability of favourable hydrogeologic conditions (amounting to an implicit validation of the calculated minimum values of return-flow times); 4) site acceptance based on quantifiable and observable flow-controlling parameters; and 5) simple logistics and favourable economics of site selection and screening. As a by-product of modeling, it is demonstrated that the presence of old water is not an indication of stagnancy. R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute;: Le concept de zone de recharge indique que, dans des environnements naturels du type du Bouclier canadien, les zones de recharge des syst&egrave;mes aquif&egrave;res r&eacute;gionaux sont pr&eacute;f&eacute;rables pour les stockages de d&eacute;chets nucl&eacute;aires &agrave; haut risque aux autres types de r&eacute;gimes d'&eacute;coulement souterrain, et particuli&egrave;rement aux zones de d&eacute;charge d'eau souterraine. Cette conclusion est tir&eacute;e d'une analyse des mod&egrave;les d'&eacute;coulements souterrains dans les bassins. Les calculs ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s pour la partie lat&eacute;rale en 2-D d'un bassin topographique compl&egrave;tement satur&eacute;, long de 20 km et profond de 4 km, dans lequel la nappe s'&eacute;coule sous l'effet de la gravit&eacute;. Diff&eacute;rentes distributions de la conductivit&eacute; hydraulique ont &eacute;t&eacute; prises en consid&eacute;ration: 1) homog&egrave;ne, 2) stratifi&eacute;e, et 3) stratifi&eacute;e avec failles. Le plongement des failles a &eacute;t&eacute; modifi&eacute; par &eacute;tapes depuis la verticale jusqu'&agrave; l'horizontale, pour diff&eacute;rentes variantes. Dans son concept, le mod&egrave;le est sens&eacute; repr&eacute;senter l'environnement des roches cristallines du Bouclier canadien. Le fonctionnement hydrog&eacute;ologique d'hypoth&eacute;tiques sites de stockage souterrain &agrave; 500 m de profondeur dans les zones de recharge et de d&eacute;charge ont &eacute;t&eacute; caract&eacute;ris&eacute;s par 13 param&egrave;tres. Les principaux avantages des zones de recharge par rapport aux zones de d&eacute;charge sont 1) des axes d'&eacute;coulement et des temps de retour du lieu de stockage &agrave; la surface plus longs; 2) la robustesse des valeurs pr&eacute;dites pour les param&egrave;tres de fonctionnement; 3) la possibilit&eacute; de v&eacute;rifier sur le terrain les conditions hydrog&eacute;ologiques favorables (ce qui revient &agrave; une validation implicite des valeurs minimales calcul&eacute;es des dur&eacute;es de retour des &eacute;coulements); 4) le choix d'un site sur la base des param&egrave;tres de contr&ocirc;le de l'&eacute;coulement quantifiables et observables, et 5) une logistique simple et une co&ucirc;t favorable pour la s&eacute;lection du site et son isolement. Parmi les cons&eacute;quences de cette mod&eacute;lisation, on d&eacute;montre que la pr&eacute;sence d'eau ancienne n'est pas un indice d'absence d'&eacute;coulement. RESUMEN: El Concepto de &Aacute;rea de Recarga consiste en que, en medios naturales de tipo similar al Escudo Canadiense, las &aacute;reas de recarga en sistemas regionales de flujo de aguas subterr&aacute;neas son mejores para el almacenamiento de residuos nucleares de alta actividad que otras zonas, especialmente las &aacute;reas de descarga. A esta conclusi&oacute;n se ha llegado a partir de un an&aacute;lisis del flujo de agua subterr&aacute;nea en modelos de cuenca. Los c&aacute;lculos se realizaron en una ladera bidimensional de una cuenca topogr&aacute;fica totalmente saturada, de 20 km de largo y 4 km de profundidad, bajo condiciones de flujo subterr&aacute;neo grav&iacute;fico. Se consideraron las siguientes variantes respecto a las distribuciones de conductividad hidr&aacute;ulica: 1) homog&eacute;nea; 2) estratificada; y 3) estratificada-con fallas. La posici&oacute;n de las fallas se vari&oacute; de manera escalonada desde vertical a horizontal para distintas variantes. Se considera que este modelo conceptual proporciona una buena representaci&oacute;n del medio cristalino rocoso del Escudo Canadiense. El comportamiento hidrogeol&oacute;gico de hipot&eacute;ticos almacenamientos situados a 500 m de profundidad en &aacute;reas de recarga y descarga se caracteriz&oacute; mediante trece par&aacute;metros. Las principales ventajas de las &aacute;reas de recarga sobre las de descarga son: 1) mayores caminos recorridos y tiempos de llegada desde el almacenamiento a la superficie; 2) robustez de los valores predichos para los par&aacute;metros de comportamiento; 3) verificabilidad en campo de las condiciones hidrogeol&oacute;gicos favorables (equivalente a una validaci&oacute;n impl&iacute;cita de los valores de tiempos de llegada m&iacute;nimos calculados); 4) aceptaci&oacute;n del emplazamiento basada en par&aacute;metros cuantificables y observables; y 5) log&iacute;stica simple y econom&iacute;a de selecci&oacute;n des emplazamiento. Como un producto secundario de la modelaci&oacute;n, se demuestra que la presencia de paleoagua no es necesariamente una indicaci&oacute;n de estancamiento del agua.},

The divergence is consistent and systematic requiring a mathematical derivation of the formula using first principles. The incorporation of the physical characteristics of the adsorbed water layer surrounding a clay particle results in a generalized Kozeny–Carman equation with two new parameters. The porosity correction factor gives the effective porosity taking into account the thickness of the adsorbed water layer and the mass specific surface area of the clay. The second parameter is shown to depend on the interparticle contact area and the interparticle contact stress. The ability of the proposed physically based generalized Kozeny–Carman equation to explain the results from some of the published laboratory permeability tests is tested. The paper results in a new theoretical framework to model changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity in clays where the soil profile is compacting as a result of changes in pore-water pressure and or externally applied loads.},

abstract = {Three groups of thermal springs with temperatures close to 70 degrees C discharge both in the core (at Bagni di Vinadio and Terme di Valdieri) and on the external margin (at Berthemont-Les-Bains) of the Argentera Massif. Detailed structural field analysis carried out on the hydrothermal sites allows us to delineate both a model of Alpine tectonic evolution of the Argentera Massif and the patterns of hydrothermal circulation that were active during its final exhumation. The observed fault rock assemblages provide information relative to deformation that occurred in viscous, frictional-to-viscous and frictional crustal regimes. During the Early Miocene, the Bersezio Fault Zone and the Fremamorta Shear Zone, two main mylonitic shear zones, mainly accommodated regional transpression and provided pathways for fluid flow promoting mineral reactions in greenschist facies. During the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene, frictional-to-viscous deformation affected the massif, which underwent predominant transpression in the internal sectors and extension on the external margin. During the Plio-Pleistocene, deformation in frictional condition accompanied the final exhumation of the massif in a transpressive regime and resulted in the development of the NW-SE striking cataclastic zones. The hydraulic properties of these structures mainly influence the patterns of the active thermal circulations and the localization of the recharge and discharge zones. At Berthemont these faults represent conduits, whereas at Vinadio and Valdieri they form complex systems of conduits and barriers. In these two latter sites, the cataclastic faults compose flower structures that constrain laterally the thermal fluid flows while intensely fractured granites sited at depth constitute a highly-transmissive geothermal reservoir. Less permeable migmatitic gneisses overlaying the granites prevent a massive infiltration of the cold fluids at depth. This context favours within the high-permeability fractures granites the development of buoyancy-driven flows which combined with topographically-driven flows, provided the conditions for the upflow of the high-temperature waters.},

abstract = {Nonconservative excesses of dissolved metals in northern San Francisco Bay indicate that there are internal sources of metals within the bay. We quantified groundwater seepage and bioirrigation rates in this area to determine their roles in transporting dissolved metals from benthic sediments to surface waters. We deployed seepage meters and collected sediment, pore water, and bottom water samples at three sites. We determined seepage rates from seepage meters and modeled the transport of water through the sediment using pore water data to constrain rates of diffusion, advection, and bioirrigation. A groundwater flow model incorporating sediment physical properties and local topography constrains more regional seepage estimates. The seepage meters indicate upflow rates from 7 to 56 cm yr−1 in March and April 1999 with some large (≤50 cm yr−1) daily fluctuations that greatly exceed predictions based on sediment physical properties and tidally induced pore pressure variations. During this period, results from modeling pore water chemical data are consistent with a small bioirrigation rate (<1.5 × 10−7 s−1) relative to values determined for southern San Francisco Bay, and an average groundwater upwelling speed of 15 cm yr−1. The speed and direction of flow changed throughout the year, with best fits to the data ranging from 20 cm yr−1 upflow to 34 cm yr−1 downflow and averaging 4 cm yr−1 upflow. Confidence intervals (95%) are about ±10 cm yr−1 for this method, yet the range of acceptable seepage rates for temporally successive periods only overlap in one of four cases, suggesting that temporal variability can be discerned from potential artifacts. Groundwater flow modeling suggests that the seepage rates determined at our sites represent ∼45% of the average seepage rate for the area, applying one consolidation and permeability relationship to all sediments. If we apply these approximations to all of northern San Francisco Bay, benthic fluxes of dissolved metals to the surface waters could account for a relatively large amount (≤60%) of the unknown sources of dissolved cobalt and a relatively small amount (≤4%) of the unknown sources of dissolved silver, cadmium, copper, nickel, and zinc. More focused groundwater discharge or elevated metals concentrations are required to have a larger impact on trace element budgets in this setting.},

Population-genomic data from eleven Scandinavian Stone-Age human remains suggest that hunter-gatherers had lower genetic diversity than farmers. Despite their close geographical proximity, the genetic differentiation between the two Stone-Age groups was greater than that observed among extant European populations. Additionally, the Scandinavian Neolithic farmers exhibited a greater degree of hunter-gatherer-related admixture than that of the Tyrolean Iceman, who also originated from a farming context. In contrast, Scandinavian hunter-gatherers displayed no significant evidence of introgression from farmers. Our findings suggest that Stone-Age foraging groups were historically in low numbers, likely due to oscillating living conditions or restricted carrying-capacity, and that they were partially incorporated into expanding farming groups.},

abstract = {Abstract Erosion of orogenic mountain ranges exhumes deeply buried rocks and controls weathering, climate, and sediment production and transport at a variety of scales. Erosion also affects the topographic form and kinematics of orogens, and it may provide dynamic feedbacks between climate and tectonics by spatially focused erosion and rock uplift. Thermochronology measures the timing and rates at which rocks approach the surface and cool as a result of exhumation. Relatively well-understood noble gas and fission-track thermochronometric systems have closure temperatures ranging from 60 to 550oC, making them sensitive to exhumation through crustal depths of about one to tens of kilometers. Thus, thermochronology can constrain erosion rates and their spatial-temporal variations on timescales of 105-107 years, commensurate with orogenic growth and decay cycles and possible climate-tectonic feedback response times. Useful methods for estimating erosion rates include inverting ages for erosion rates using crustal thermal models, vertical transects, and detrital approaches. Spatial-temporal patterns of thermochronometrically determined erosion rates help constrain flow of material through orogenic wedges, orogenic growth and decay cycles, paleorelief, and relationships with structural, geomorphic, or climatic features.},

Intrusions affect Ro values to distances twice the diameter of the intrusions, that is, less than 5 km. Aureoles of OM alteration around mineral showings, on the other hand, exceed 10 km. The petrographic properties of OM allow outlining distinctive aureoles around mineral showings. As these aureoles are different from those around intrusions, their recognition can be considered as potentially useful in mineral exploration. The gradients of Ro reflect types of thermal alteration that are quite distinct for mineralization and intrusions. Despite the numerous alkaline bodies within a 15-km-wide belt extending for 140 km, and contact aureoles of hornfels, the extent of thermal alteration around the intrusions is such that their emplacement had little effect on regional trends of maturation in the sedimentary basin. It is suggested that the differences in OM alteration between mineral showings and intrusions is a result of the mode of heat propagation involved in each case. The mineral showings are no doubt of hydrothermal origin, and the fluids involved could have both altered the OM and efficiently transported the heat required to increase Ro. The intrusions, by contrast, must have been relatively "dry," and emplaced in rocks with little extant porosity and permeability, so that heat transfer could not have been enhanced by movement of pore fluids.},

abstract = {We describe a new numerical method that uses inverse methods to model thermal stabilization of a borehole after drilling mud circulation has stopped. The following five geophysical parameters can be estimated from the method: (1) true formation temperature (Tf); (2) mud temperature (Tm) at the time the mud circulation stops; (3) thermal invasion distance (R) into the formation before the formation is at the true formation temperature(Tf); (4) formation thermal conductivity (K) perpendicular to the borehole; and (5) efficiency factor (F) for heating mud in the borehole after mud circulation has stopped. Crucial input data for the model are the temperature measurements with shut-in time taken at a fixed depth, more than two measurements being required, and the mud temperature at the surface at the time circulation stops. Other input data include the radius of the borehole, and the densities and specific heats of the drilling mud and of the formation on which the temperature measurements are made. Applications of the new inverse procedure to both synthetic data and field data show that the true formation temperature in many cases can be estimated precisely (to within about 0.4 percent); that the mud temperature can be estimated with acceptable accuracy (5 percent or so); while the thermal conductivity (K), the thermal invasion distance (R), and the efficiency factor (F) can be roughly estimated, provided high-quality data are available.},

abstract = {Widely used to study surface processes and the development of topography through geologic time, (U–Th)/He thermochronometry in apatite depends on a quantitative description of the kinetics of4He diffusion across a range of temperatures, timescales, and geologic scenarios. Empirical observations demonstrate that He diffusivity in apatite is not solely a function of temperature, but also depends on damage to the crystal structure from radioactive decay processes. Commonly-used models accounting for the influence of thermal annealing of radiation damage on He diffusivity assume the net effects evolve in proportion to the rate of fission track annealing, although the majority of radiation damage results from $\alpha$-recoil. While existing models adequately quantify the net effects of damage annealing in many geologic scenarios, experimental work suggests different annealing rates for the two damage types. Here, we introduce an alpha-damage annealing model (ADAM) that is independent of fission track annealing kinetics, and directly quantifies the influence of thermal annealing on He diffusivity in apatite. We present an empirical fit to diffusion kinetics data and incorporate this fit into a model that tracks the competing effects of radiation damage accumulation and annealing on He diffusivity in apatite through geologic time. Using time–temperature paths to illustrate differences between models, we highlight the influence of damage annealing on data interpretation. In certain, but not all, geologic scenarios, the interpretation of low-temperature thermochronometric data can be strongly influenced by which model of radiation damage annealing is assumed. In particular, geologic scenarios involving 1–2 km of sedimentary burial are especially sensitive to the assumed rate of annealing and its influence on He diffusivity. In cases such as basement rocks in Grand Canyon and the Canadian Shield, (U–Th)/He ages predicted from the ADAM can differ by hundreds of Ma from those predicted by other models for a given thermal path involving extended residence between ∼40–80 °C.},

@article{Jaupart1999,
abstract = {We compare heat flow data from the Precambrian shields in North America and in South Africa. We also review data available in other less well-sampled Shield regions. Variations in crustal heat production account for most of the variability of the heat flow. Because of this variability, it is difficult to define a single average crustal model representative of a whole tectonic province. The average heat flow values of different Archean provinces in Canada, South Africa, Australia and India differ by significant amounts. This is also true for Proterozoic provinces. For example, the heat flow is significantly higher in the Proterozoic Namaqua-Natal Belt of South Africa than in the Grenville Province of the Canadian Shield (61 vs. 41 mW m-2 on average). These observations indicate that it is not possible to define single value of the average heat flow for all provinces of the same crustal age. Large amplitude short wavelength variations of the heat flow suggest that most of the difference between Proterozoic and Archean heat flow is of crustal origin. In eastern Canada, there is no good correlation between the local values of heat flow and heat production. In the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces of eastern Canada, heat flow values through rocks with the same heat production are not significantly different. There is therefore no evidence for variations of the mantle heat flow beneath these different provinces. After removing the local crustal heat production from the surface heat flow, the mantle (Moho) heat flow was estimated to be between 10-15 mW m-2 in the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces of eastern Canada. Estimates of the mantle heat flow in the Kaapvaal craton of South Africa may be slightly higher ([approximate]17 mW m-2). Large-scale variations of bulk crustal heat production are well-documented in Canada and imply significant differences of deep lithospheric thermal structure. In thick lithosphere, surficial heat flow measurements record a time average of heat production in the lithospheric mantle and are not in equilibrium with the instantaneous heat production. The low mantle heat flow and current estimates of heat production in the lithospheric mantle do not support a mechanical (conductive) lithosphere thinner than 200 km and thicker than 330 km. Temperature anomalies with surrounding oceanic mantle extend to the convective boundary layer below the conductive layer, and hence to depths greater than these estimates. Mechanical and thermal stability of the lithosphere require the mantle part of the lithosphere to be chemically buoyant and depleted in radiogenic elements. Both characteristics are achieved simultaneously by partial melting and melt extraction.},

This paper compiles a record of the geotechnical parameters of the main clay formations found in the Netherlands Tertiary as well as briefly states the context in which these parameters are used to study the performance of the deeper sediments in relation to gravitational settlement and underground space studies. The clays are studied at unusually deep depths for geotechnical purposes, which require caution when using geotechnical values from similar formations at shallower depths in Belgium and the UK. The relatively sparse data and the strange properties appear to result in more questions than answers.},

The gouge ratio, when applied to sand-shale sequences, indicates the proportion of phyllosilicate material that is expected to be incorporated into the fault rock, hence it provides a measure of the seal capacity. Gouge ratios for faulted reservoir sequences are computed from data that are routinely available from fields at the appraisal or production stage. We present a repeatable methodology that maximizes the use of seismically based geometric data and well-based stratigraphic and compositional data. The resulting gouge ratio calculations can be used comparatively at the scale of individual faults, fields or basins. We examine an example fault from the Oseberg Syd Field that is known to seal and we show that a threshold shale gouge ratio of 18% will support a cross-fault pressure difference of c. 8 bar.},

abstract = {The alignment of olivine crystals is considered as the dominant source of seismic anisotropy in the subcrustal lithosphere and asthenosphere. Different components of large-scale anisotropy can be traced in depth distributions of the radial and azimuthal anisotropy of surface waves. We propose a global model of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) as a transition between a `frozen-in' anisotropy in the lithosphere to anisotropy in the sublithospheric mantle related to the present-day flow. Due to different orientations of velocity maxima in the anisotropic subcrustal lithosphere and the asthenosphere, the velocity contrast related to the LAB can increase in particular directions. Because of their long wavelengths and horizontal propagation, surface waves suffer from poor lateral resolution. However, surface waves with various wavelengths allow us to map gross features of the LAB with a good vertical resolution. We estimate depths to the LAB to be between 200 and 250 km for the Precambrian shields and platforms, around 100 km for the Phanerozoic continental regions and 40-70 km beneath oceans from the world-wide depth distribution of the radial and azimuthal anisotropy of surface waves.},

temperature and pressure history during Mesozoic and Cenozoic times. Quantification and modelling of burial, maturity and
temperature histories are the major goals of this study, allowing for a better understanding of the general geological evolution
of the different basins as well as petroleum generation. All major basins in The Netherlands encountered at least one time
of inversion and therefore moderate to high amounts of erosion. In order to determine the amount of inversion the basins have
experienced, a 1D study was performed on 20 wells within three basins (West Netherlands, Central Netherlands and Lower Saxony
Basins). New vitrinite reflectance values were obtained and existing data re-evaluated to gain a good data base. The burial
histories of six wells, two for each studied basin, are presented here, to demonstrate the differences in basin evolution
that led to their present shape and petroleum potential. The Permo-Triassic subsidence phase can be recognized in all three
basins, but with varying intensity. In the Jurassic, the basins experienced different relative movements that culminated in
the Cretaceous when the influence of the inversion caused erosion of up to 2,500 m. Most wells show deepest burial at present-day,
whereas the timing of maximum temperature differs significantly.},

The ages, exclusive of the one distinctly older age, do not correlate with isotopic ages for the same rocks and are taken to represent a regional event. They could be attributed to Cretaccous regional heating of wide extent and low temperature or alternatively to regional cooling which accompanied uplift and denudation.

abstract = {Global climate changes during the Cenozoic (65.5-0 Ma) caused major biological range shifts and extinctions. In northern Europe, for example, a pattern of few endemics and the dominance of wide-ranging species is thought to have been determined by the Pleistocene (2.59-0.01 Ma) glaciations. This study, in contrast, reveals an ancient subsurface fauna endemic to Britain and Ireland. Using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach, we found that two species of stygobitic invertebrates (genus Niphargus) have not only survived the entire Pleistocene in refugia but have persisted for at least 19.5 million years. Other Niphargus species form distinct cryptic taxa that diverged from their nearest continental relative between 5.6 and 1.0 Ma. The study also reveals an unusual biogeographical pattern in the Niphargus genus. It originated in north-west Europe approximately 87 Ma and underwent a gradual range expansion. Phylogenetic diversity and species age are highest in north-west Europe, suggesting resilience to extreme climate change and strongly contrasting the patterns seen in surface fauna. However, species diversity is highest in south-east Europe, indicating that once the genus spread to these areas (approximately 25 Ma), geomorphological and climatic conditions enabled much higher diversification. Our study highlights that groundwater ecosystems provide an important contribution to biodiversity and offers insight into the interactions between biological and climatic processes.},

The time since groundwater was recharged[mdash]or groundwater age[mdash]can be important for diverse geologic processes, such as chemical weathering, ocean eutrophication and climate change. However, measured groundwater ages range from months to millions of years. The global volume and distribution of groundwater less than 50 years old[mdash]modern groundwater that is the most recently recharged and also the most vulnerable to global change[mdash]are unknown. Here we combine geochemical, geologic, hydrologic and geospatial data sets with numerical simulations of groundwater and analyse tritium ages to show that less than 6% of the groundwater in the uppermost portion of Earth[rsquor]s landmass is modern. We find that the total groundwater volume in the upper 2[thinsp]km of continental crust is approximately 22.6[thinsp]million km3, of which 0.1-5.0 million km3 is less than 50 years old. Although modern groundwater represents a small percentage of the total groundwater on Earth, the volume of modern groundwater is equivalent to a body of water with a depth of about 3[thinsp]m spread over the continents. This water resource dwarfs all other components of the active hydrologic cycle.},

abstract = {The structural evolution of the Dutch Central North Sea Graben and the fault-bounded Broad Fourteens Basin is discussed. Graben formation started during the Early Triassic and culminated in strong differential subsidence during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. Narrow fault-bounded grabens and troughs and broad intervening highs were formed as a result of crustal distension and associated transtensional deformations. The thickness of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous fill of these basins may have exceeded 3000 m. Concurrent with the filling of these basins the bordering highs became deeply truncated. During the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, compressive stresses resulted in inversion of these basins, whereby movements along their bounding normal faults were reversed, giving rise locally to overthrusting as, for instance, in the Broad Fourteens and West Netherlands basins. The timing of these compressional deformations has been palaeontologically dated and coincides with major orogenic events in the Alps.},

The topographic expression of mantle plume impingement on continental lithosphere and lithospheric folding has some striking similarities. Observations from a number of areas in Europe's intraplate lithosphere demonstrate that these mechanisms commonly interact in space and time. We present the results of thermomechanical modelling addressing the role of factors such as the presence of a hot upper mantle, the spatial dimensions of the plume and the time constants involved in the temporal succession of plume activity and lithospheric folding by stress accumulation in intraplate continental lithosphere. The results demonstrate that both the processes, plume2013lithosphere interactions and folding may interact resulting either in strong amplification, attenuation or modification of their surface expression. These inferences are compatible with a number of key observations on the nature and the temporal succession of topography evolution in the Alpine foreland, the Pannonian Basin, the Scandinavian continental margin and the Iberian Peninsula.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal fluid circulation within the sea floor profoundly influences the physical, chemical and biological state of the crust and the oceans. Circulation within ridge flanks (in crust more than 1 Myr old) results in greater heat loss and fluid flux than that at ridge crests and persists for millions of years, thereby altering the composition of the crust and overlying ocean. Fluid flow in oceanic crust is, however, limited by the extent and nature of the rock's permeability. Here we demonstrate that the global data set of borehole permeability measurements in uppermost oceanic crust defines a trend with age that is consistent with changes in seismic velocity. This trend-which indicates that fluid flow should be greatly reduced in crust older than a few million years-would appear to be inconsistent with heat-flow observations, which on average indicate significant advective heat loss in crust up to 65 Myr old. But our calculations, based on a lateral flow model, suggest that regional-scale permeabilities are much higher than have been measured in boreholes. These results can be reconciled if most of the fluid flow in the upper crust is channelized through a small volume of rock, influencing the geometry of convection and the nature of fluid-rock interaction.},

abstract = {Using a coupled regional climate-hydrologic modeling system, RAMS-Hydro, we investigate the role of the water table dynamics in controlling soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), boundary layer dynamics, and precipitation. In an earlier study we showed that a shallow water table can primarily exist in two types of hydrologic settings in North America: the humid river valleys and coastal regions in the east and the arid or semiarid intermountain valleys in the west. We also showed that the shallow water table in these settings can lead to significantly wetter soils than would exist without the presence of the water table. Here, we show that the water table-induced wetter soil directly maps into enhanced ET in the western setting, where soil water is a strong limiting factor of ET flux, but it is less likely to be the case in the more humid eastern setting where soil water is not limiting in general. We also ask whether any resulting enhanced ET will directly map into enhanced precipitation. Our hypothesis is that this can occur through two primary mechanisms: local, ET-driven enhancement of convective precipitation and enhanced regional or lateral moisture convergence caused by altered soil moisture fields, and hence altered ET, far from the region of concern. We find that, indeed, water table-induced higher ET in the arid west results in greater convective precipitation and that ET-precipitation coupling is primarily through local feedback pathways and precipitation recycling, with the main role of large-scale moisture convergence as an initiator of convection following dry periods. Transitioning to the more humid regions farther east, the greater atmospheric (relative to surface) control of precipitation progressively obscures any potential effects of the water table, and the effects of large-scale moisture convergence tend to dominate.},

abstract = {Studies of inverted basins based solely on the preserved section provide only partial insight into the thermal and tectonic history of basin development. Equally important is that part of the history represented by section removed by erosion during inversion. Thermal History Reconstruction, involving application of Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTATM) and Vitrinite Reflectance (VR) to define the timing and magnitude of key erosional and/or thermal episodes, and integration of this information with data from the preserved section, provides a more complete description. Case histories from the UK, New Zealand and Australia are presented to demonstrate this approach. Much of northern and eastern England, the Irish Sea and the Southern North Sea was affected by heating apparently due largely to additional burial, followed by early Tertiary cooling due to regional uplift and erosion, synchronous with recognized basin inversion events. Heating associated with this episode caused generation of hydrocarbons throughout the region. Areas conventionally regarded as not inverted appear to have been subjected to km-scale uplift and erosion, which was not restricted to classic  inversion axes'. Failure to allow for these effects can lead to a significant underestimation of regional maturity trends. Thermal History Reconstruction is also essential in areas that have undergone more than one episode of inversion. For example in Inner Moray Firth well 12/16--1 maximum palaeotemperatures in the Carboniferous section were reached prior to Hercynian inversion and the chances of preserving any hydrocarbons generated from Carboniferous or older source rocks appear poor. In southeastern Australia, early Cretaceous rift basins underwent mid-Cretaceous inversion at a time of high palaeogeothermal gradients (c. 60{degrees}C km-1), and basement margins were also inverted at that time. Again, early generation implies that the chances of preservation of hydrocarbons are small. By integrating stratigraphic and structural relationships within the preserved section with data on the palaeo-thermal history of a section derived from direct measurements of palaeotemperature profiles, the complete history of hydrocarbon generation may be reconstructed with confidence.},

abstract = {An analytical solution is presented for the nonlinear dynamics of high amplitude necking in a free layer of power-law fluid extended in layer-parallel direction due to buoyancy stress. The solution is one-dimensional (1-D) and contains three dimensionless parameters: the thinning factor (i.e. ratio of current to initial layer thickness), the power-law stress exponent, n, and the ratio of time to the characteristic deformation time of a viscous layer under buoyancy stress, t/tc. tc is the ratio of the layer's effective viscosity to the applied buoyancy stress. The value of tc/n specifies the time for detachment, i.e. the time it takes until the layer thickness has thinned to zero. The first-order accuracy of the 1-D solution is confirmed with 2-D finite element simulations of buoyancy-driven necking in a layer of power-law fluid embedded in a linear or power-law viscous medium. The analytical solution is accurate within a factor about 2 if the effective viscosity ratio between the layer and the medium is larger than about 100 and if the medium is a power-law fluid. The analytical solution is applied to slab detachment using dislocation creep laws for dry and wet olivine. Results show that one of the most important parameters controlling the dynamics of slab detachment is the strength of the slab which strongly depends on temperature and rheological parameters. The fundamental conclusions concerning slab detachment resulting from both the analytical solution and from earlier published thermo-mechanical numerical simulations agree well, indicating the usefulness of the highly simplified analytical solution for better understanding slab detachment. Slab detachment resulting from viscous necking is a combination of inhomogeneous thinning due to varying buoyancy stress within the slab and a necking instability due to the power-law viscous rheology (n>1). Application of the analytical solution to the Hindu Kush slab provides no "order-of-magnitude argument" against slab detachment and, therefore, supports existing studies suggesting a currently ongoing slab detachment in the Hindu Kush slab. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A wide diversity of techniques is now available to help constrain the timing and duration of fluid flow events and fluid-rock interactions in sedimentary basins. Dating methods in rocks traditionally focus on the use of minerals that contain radiogenic isotopes (U-Pb, Pb-Pb, K-Ar, Rb-Sr in particular). I do not intend to dwell on this approach as it is covered adequately elsewhere (e.g. Faure 1986), but it is worthwhile emphasizing that certain phases that are commonly precipitated during diagenesis in sedimentary basins are suitable for such techniques (see below). The range of techniques summarized below were mostly presented in a Queen's University Geofluids Group International Seminar on Dating of Fluid Flow, incorporated within the Geofluids II conference held at Belfast in March 1997.  There is a limited range of parameters within rocks or minerals which change with time, and which can therefore be used to deduce an age of formation for epigenetic mineral phases. The processes of radioactive decay yield predictable quantities of daughter products (radiometric dating) and particles whose pathways can be observed and whose annealling behaviour is predictable (fission track analysis). In addition we can measure the effects of movement over the Earth's surface relative to her magnetic field along a well-known polar-wander curve (palaeomagnetism). In some cases we can measure a record of contemporary seawater chemistry that can be related to a well established database of changing stable isotope composition. Furthermore, in young rocks we can measure the consequences of other physico-chemical reactions that are kinetically controlled (electron spin resonance).  ...

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 2412013253 The brittle upper continental crust predominantly consists of granite and gneiss. Fractures form an interconnected network of water-conducting structures with an appreciable permeability also providing substantial fluid-saturated fracture porosity. The chemical composition of fluids in the fracture porosity of granite and gneiss changes with depth. Near the surface Ca2013Na2013HCO3 waters dominate. With increasing depth, water contains increasing amounts of alkalis and sulfate and grade into chloride-rich waters at greater depth. Total dissolved solids (TDS) of 105�mg�l22121 are common at 5-km depth in most basement rocks. All reported deep fluids from the upper crust contain predominantly NaCl and CaCl2. The brines vary from NaCl-rich in granites to CaCl2-rich in mafic reservoir rocks such as amphibolites and gabbros. In regions of the crust with strong topography, fluid flow is important and recharge water may have flushed the basement efficiently, thereby removing old brine components from the granites. Water samples from the new Gotthard Rail Base Tunnel of the Alps represent this type of basement fluid. Analyzed fluids from up to 2.5-km depth differ from basement fluids from areas with less-extreme topography in the following ways. Such waters have relatively low TDS of some 100�mg�l22121 and are typically of the Na2CO32013Na2SO4 type. pH tends to be high and varies from 9 to more than 10. Low Ca and ultra-low Mg of such waters result from efficient deposition of secondary Ca2013Mg minerals as coatings on fracture walls. Reduction of CO2 to CH4 provides the oxidation capacity for sulfate production from primary rock sulfides. The composition of fluids in fractured continental crust at depths below 120132�km depends strongly on the topography of the erosion surface. In crust with rugged alpine topography fluids at this depth are low-TDS high-pH waters that derive its composition from fluid2013rock interaction alone. In crust with low-to-moderate topography, basement fluids are normally near neutral high-TDS Na2013Ca chloride brines that derive the solutes not only from the rock matrix but also from external sources.},

The second generation is present as shear veins of Variscan age, and contains quartz, chlorite and ferroan calcite. The third generation consists of ankerite filling post-Variscan fractures. The oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of the two ankerite phases and of the ferroan calcites are respectively between &#150;16.4 and &#150;11.4&#137; PDB between &#150;17.8 and &#150;1.7&#137; PDB. This range is greater than that of calcite nodules in the lower Devonian siliciclastic sediments (&#3918O= &#150;15.6 to &#150;11.1&#137; PDB and &#3913C= &#150;13.4 to &#150;10.2&#137; PDB). This suggests precipitation of the carbonate veins from a fluid which was at most only partly isotopically buffered by the calcite nodules in the host rock. The calculated oxygen isotopic composition of the ambient fluid from which the calcite veins formed is between +7.8 and +10.0&#137; SMOW. Two main fluid types have been recognized in fluid inclusions in the quartz and carbonates. The first fluid type is present as secondary fluid inclusions in the first and second vein generations. The fluid has a salinity of 0.5&#150;7.2 eq. wt.% NaCl and a high, but variable, homogenization temperature (Th=124&#150;188&#176;C). Two origins can be proposed for this fluid. It could have been expelled from the lower Devonian or could have been derived from the metamorphic zone to the south of the area studied. Taking into account the microthermometric and stable-isotope data, and the regional geological setting, the fluid most likely originated from metamorphic rocks and interacted with the lower Devonian along its migration path. This is in agreement with numerical simulations of the palaeofluid and especially the palaeotempera-ture field, which is based on chlorite geothermometry and vitrinite reflectance data. The second fluid type occurs as secondary inclusions in the shear veins and as fluid inclusions of unknown origin in post-Variscan ankerite veins. Therefore, it has a post-Variscan age. The inclusions are characterized by a high salinity (18.6&#150;22.9 eq. wt.% CaCl2). The composition of the fluid is similar to that which caused the development of Mississippi Valley-type Pb&#150;Zn deposits in Belgium.},

The solution applies to steady-state, saturated flow through an unconfined, horizontal aquifer recharged by surface infiltration and discharging to a downgradient fixed-head boundary. The upgradient boundary can represent, using the same equation, a no-flow boundary or a fixed head. The approach is unique for calculating travel times because it makes no a priori assumptions regarding the limit of the water table rise with respect to the minimum saturated aquifer thickness. The computed travel times are verified against a numerical model, and examples are provided, which show that the predicted travel times can be on the order of nine times longer relative to existing analytical solutions.},

abstract = {Global compilations of surface heat flow data from stable, Precambrian terrains show a statistically significant secular change from 41+/-11 mW/m2 in Archean to 55+/-17 mW/m2 in Proterozoic regions far removed from Archean cratons. Using the tectonothermal age of the continents coupled with average heat flow for different age provinces yields a mean continental surface heat flow between 47 and 49 mW/m2 (depending on the average, non-orogenic heat flow assumed for Phanerozoic regions). Compositional models for bulk continental crust that produce this much or more heat flow (i.e., K2O\textgreater2.3-2.4 wt%) are not consistent with these observations. More rigorous constraints on crust composition cannot be had from heat flow data until the relative contributions to surface heat flow from crust and mantle are better determined and the non-orogenic component of heat flow in the areally extensive Phanerozoic regions (35% of the continents) is determined. We calculate conductive geotherms for 41 mW/m2 surface heat flow to place limits on the heat production of Archean mantle roots and to evaluate the significance of the pressure-temperature (P-T) array for cratonic mantle xenoliths. Widely variable geotherms exist for this surface heat flow, depending on the values of crustal and lithospheric mantle heat production that are adopted. Using the average K content of cratonic peridotite xenoliths (0.15 wt% K2O, assuming Th/U=3.9 and K/U=10,000 to give a heat production of 0.093 [mu]W/m3) and a range of reasonable crustal heat production values (i.e., ≥0.5 [mu]W/m3), we calculate geotherms that are so strongly curved they never intersect the mantle adiabat. Thus the average cratonic peridotite is not representative of the heat production of Archean mantle roots. Using our preferred estimate of heat production in the cratonic mantle (0.03 wt% K2O, or 0.019 [mu]W/m3) we find that the only geotherms that pass through the xenolith P-T data array are those corresponding to crust having very low heat production (\textless0.9 wt% K2O). If the lithospheric mantle heat production is higher than our preferred values, the continental crust must have correspondingly lower heat production (i.e., bulk crustal K, Th and U contents lower than that of average Archean granulite facies terrains), which we consider unlikely. If the xenolith P-T data reflect equilibration to a conductive geotherm, then Archean lithosphere is relatively thin (150-200 km, based on intersection of the P-T array with the mantle adiabat) and the primary reason for the lower surface heat flow in Archean regions is decreased crustal heat production, rather than the insulating effects of thick lithospheric roots. On the other hand, if the xenolith P-T points result from frozen-in mineral equilibria or reflect perturbed geotherms associated with magmatism, then the Archean crust can have higher heat producing element concentrations, lithospheric thickness can range to greater depths and the low surface heat flow in Archean cratons may be due to the insulating effects of thick lithospheric roots. An uppermost limit for Archean crustal heat production of 0.77 [mu]W/m3 is determined from the heat flow systematics.},

Here, we present the first spatially explicit global estimates of N inputs via SGD to coastal waters and show that it has increased from about 1.0 to 1.4 Tg of nitrate (NO3-N) per year over the second half of the 20th century. Since this increase is not accompanied by an equivalent increase of groundwater phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si), SGD transport of nitrate is an important factor for the development of harmful algal blooms in coastal waters. Groundwater fluxes of N are linked to areas with high runoff and intensive anthropogenic activity on land, with Southeast Asia, parts of North and Central America, and Europe being hot spots},

abstract = {Latent heat flux at the surface is largely dependent on the roughness length for water vapor (z0q ). The determination of z0q is still uncertain because of its multifaceted characteristics of surface properties, atmospheric conditions and insufficient ob- servations. In this study, observed values from the Fluxes Over Snow Surface II field experiment (FLOSS-II) from November 2002 to March 2003 were utilized to estimate z0q over various land surfaces: bare soil, snow, and senescent grass. The present results indicate that the estimated z0q over bare soil is much smaller than the roughness length of momentum (z0m ); thus, the ratio z0m/z0q is larger than those of previous studies by a factor of 20 - 150 for the available flow regime of the roughness Reyn- olds number, Re* > 0.1. On the snow surface, the ratio is comparable to a previous estimation for the rough flow (Re* > 1), but smaller by a factor of 10 - 50 as the flow became smooth (Re* < 1). Using the estimated ratio, an optimal regression equa- tion of z0m /z0q is determined as a function of Re* for each surface type. The present parameterization of the ratio is found to greatly reduce biases of latent heat flux estimation compared with that estimated by the conventional method, suggesting the usefulness.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis and modelling of apatite fission track with vitrinite reflectance (VR) data allows the timing, magnitude and pattern of Palaeogene subsidence and Neogene inversion to be established for an uplifted and largely denuded basin: the Buller Coalfield, New Zealand. At the time of maximum subsidence in the late Oligocene, the basin consisted of an extensional half graben, bounded to the west by the Kongahu Fault Zone (KFZ), with up to 6 km of upper Eocene to Oligocene section adjacent to it; currently, only a few tens of metres of basal coal measures on basement are preserved on top of a range 80020131000 m above sea level. Integrated modelling of the VR and fission track data show that the deepest parts of the basin were inverted during two Miocene compressional phases (24201319 Ma and 1320138 Ma), and are consistent with a further phase of inversion during the Quaternary that formed the present topography. Palinspastic restoration of the three phases of inversion shows that the basin was not inverted in a simple way: most of the rock uplift/denudation adjacent to the KFZ occurred during the early Miocene phase, and at the same time burial occurred in the south-eastern part of the basin (maximum temperatures were experienced at different times at different places in the basin); during the middle to late Miocene there was broad uplift in the central and eastern parts of the coalfield. Because the timing and magnitude of uplift have been derived from the zone of inversion, they can be compared independently with the timing of unconformity development and rapid subsidence in the adjacent foredeeps, particularly the Westport Trough. For the middle to late Miocene phase of inversion, we show that during the first 120132 million years of compression, the uplift within the coalfield also involved the margins of the Westport Trough, contributing to unconformity development; subsequently, uplift continued on the inversion structure but the margins of the Westport Trough subsided rapidly. This is explained by a model of stick slip behaviour on the boundary faults, especially for the KFZ. When compression started the fault zone has locked and uplift extends into the basin, whereas subsequently the fault zone unlocks, and the inversion structure overrides the basin margin, thereby loading it and causing subsidence.},

abstract = {Satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide quantitative measurement of terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes with unprecedented accuracy. Combining GRACE-observed TWS changes and independent estimates of water change in soil and snow and surface reservoirs offers a means for estimating groundwater storage change. Since its launch in March 2002, GRACE time-variable gravity data have been successfully used to quantify long-term groundwater storage changes in different regions over the world, including northwest India, the High Plains Aquifer and the Central Valley in the USA, the North China Plain, Middle East, and southern Murray–Darling Basin in Australia, where groundwater storage has been significantly depleted in recent years (or decades). It is difficult to rely on in situ groundwater measurements for accurate quantification of large, regional-scale groundwater storage changes, especially at long timescales due to inadequate spatial and temporal coverage of in situ data and uncertainties in storage coefficients. The now nearly 13 years of GRACE gravity data provide a successful and unique complementary tool for monitoring and measuring groundwater changes on a global and regional basis. Despite the successful applications of GRACE in studying global groundwater storage change, there are still some major challenges limiting the application and interpretation of GRACE data. In this paper, we present an overview of GRACE applications in groundwater studies and discuss if and how the main challenges to using GRACE data can be addressed.},

abstract = {The new Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) is used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) in a series of climate change experiments for either idealized CO2-only forcing or forcings based on observations and the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080?2100 ranges from 1.5°C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4°C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high as 2.5% K?1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6% K?1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

abstract = {We apply a recently developed 3D flexure model incorporating lateral variations in flexural rigidity (EET) and necking depth (zn) to study the 3D effects of intraplate stresses on Quaternary accelerated subsidence and uplift in the North Sea Basin and adjacent areas. In the model approach lateral variations and magnitude of predicted Quaternary vertical motions are largely dependent on the pre-existing Late Tertiary flexural state of the area and the relative change in magnitude and orientation of intraplate stresses in the Quaternary. The Late Tertiary deflections are reconstructed by incorporating lithospheric stretching values calculated from the Mesozoic subsidence record, and by adopting admissible variations in necking depth (zn) and flexural rigidity (EET) from earlier work. The 3D model results for the North Sea and adjacent areas indicate that an increase of compressive intraplate forces with a magnitude of about 2.25 x 1012 N/m can predict accelerated subsidence values up to 700 m, largely in agreement with observed patterns of Quaternary isopach values corrected for effects of shallowing waterdepth. The magnitude of the intraplate forces is 2 to 3 times lower than predicted by earlier 2D studies. It is believed that the 2D model results actually overestimate required stress levels, since they do not take into account the effect of out-of-plane stresses. The relative increase in compressive forces is in agreement with observed compressive stresses and the magnitude corresponds to characteristic values for plate boundary forces. The adopted values for zn and EET do not show a clear relation with the preceding basin history.},

abstract = {K-Ar age dates of authigenic illite from sandstones in the UK south Central Graben have a bimodal distribution. In contrast to established hypotheses of thermal triggers, this illite growth is explained by changes in hydrogeological history. Fluid motion during burial can hence be dated. Illite growth at 84-58 Ma on the graben margins was coincident with rapid subsidence of the Graben axis and consequent expulsion of pore fluids onto the margins. This event pre-dated both overpressure, and the secondary migration and accumulation of hydrocarbon in the region. Illite growth was probably caused by increased solute transport rates during pore fluid motion. Illite growth on an axial high (33-30 Ma) occurred during overpressured conditions. This was triggered either by: (1) downward fluid migration as a consequence of overpressure release. These fluids carried carboxylic acids or hydrocarbons from the highly overpressured Kimmeridge Clay Formation into the less pressured Fulmar Sandstone Formation; or (2) a decrease in water-rock ratios as fluid flow declined within the sandstones, as a consequence of overpressure build-up. Published experiments show that illite growth is favoured by low water-rock ratios.},

annote = {In fission track analysis it is common to find that the true ages of different crystal grains vary within a sample, and this may be important for geological interpretation. There are at least two well-recognized geological processes that lead to mixed ages: grains from multiple sources, and differential annealing between grains of differing composition. Data from multiple sources may be represented statistically by a finite mixture model, usually with two or three components, but data arising from the multicompositional annealing process may be better modelled as an infinite mixture. We discuss finite mixtures and two new infinite mixture models: a random effects model whose parameters describe the location and spread of the population grain ages, and a more general model encompassing both two-component mixtures and random effects. We illustrate with case studies how to use these models to estimate various features of interest such as the minimum age, the other component ages and the age dispersion.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The attenuation of the continental crust during rifting and the subsequent filling of the rift-related accommodation alter the long-term thermal and mechanical state of the lithosphere. This is primarily because the Moho is shallowed due to density contrasts between the sediment fill and the crust, but also reflects the attenuation of the pre-existing crustal heat production and its burial beneath the basin, as well the thermal properties of the basin fill. Moho shallowing and attenuation of pre-existing heat production contribute to long-term cooling of the Moho and thus lithospheric strengthening, as has been pointed out in many previous studies. In contrast, basin filling normally contributes to significant Moho heating allowing the possibility of long-term lithospheric weakening, the magnitude of which is dependent on the thermal properties of the basin-fill and the distribution of heat sources in the crust. This paper focuses on the thermal property structure of the crust and basin-fill in effecting long-term changes in lithospheric thermal regime, with particular emphasis on the distribution of heat producing elements in the crust. The parameter space appropriate to typical continental crust is explored using a formalism for the heat production distributions that makes no priori assumptions about the specific form of the distribution. The plausible parameter space allows a wide range in potential long-term thermal responses. However, with the proviso that the accommodation created by the isostatic response to rifting is essentially filled, the long-term thermal response to rift basin formation will generally increase average crustal thermal gradients beneath basins but cool the Moho due to its reduction in depth. The increase in the average crustal thermal gradient induces lateral heat flow that necessarily heats the Moho along basin margins, especially in narrow rift basins. Using coupled thermo-mechanical models with temperature sensitive creep-parameters, we show that such heating may be sufficient to localise subsequent deformation in the vicinity of major basin bounding structures, potentially explaining the offset observed in some stacked rift basin successions.},

abstract = {Flow of fluids in sedimentary basins causes transport of heat and dissolved mass and is therefore potentially important in relation to diagenetic reactions. Rather large fluid fluxes are required, however, for this type of transport to be significant in terms of dissolution and precipitation of minerals. Before diagenetic processes are attributed to pore water flow, semi-quantitative calculation of flow rates and duration of flow should be attempted. Heat flow in sedimentary basins is normally dominated by conduction, except on a local scale. The upwards pore water flux due to compaction is on average smaller than the subsidence rate, and the thermal anomalies caused by compaction are moderate in modern basins. Dissolution and precipitation of minerals which are in equilibrium with the pore water occur when the flow is oblique relative to the isotherms. Due to the low solubility/temperature gradient of the common silicate and carbonate minerals, very large fluxes of pore water are required to transport significant volumes of mass in solution. The greatest potential for transporting solids and creating secondary porosity is during meteoric water flow, because the flow rate then may be several orders of magnitude higher than what is typical for compaction-driven flow. Quartz overgrowth corresponding to 3% of the rock volume requires a total flow of 108cm3 cm-2 if the silica is introduced by vertical compaction-driven flow from a source outside the sandstone. Pore water flow precipitating quartz due to cooling will dissolve carbonate cement at a much higher rate. An external import of silica through the flow of water would be expected to cement up the most permeable pathways, such as fractures and well-sorted permeable sand beds. In the case of carbonate cement the solubility gradient is negative and upwards flowing and cooling pore water would cause dissolution rather than precipitation. Also in the case of carbonate rocks, large-scale mass transfer such as dolomitization is easier to explain as occurring at relatively shallow depths rather than during deeper burial. Ore minerals like galena have a steep solubility/temperature gradient, but concentrated precipitation requires rapid cooling of hot water. Such conditions are most likely to be met when hot fluids are cooled near the surface.},

abstract = {The quality of groundwater is threatened in karstic regions with very high population growth, such as the eastern coast of Yucatan. As polluted groundwater flows towards the ocean, coastal ecosystems and coral reefs may also be affected. Pollution and the interaction between the coastal aquifer and the reef lagoon were assessed at a developing area (Puerto Morelos, NE Yucatan Peninsula) within the Mesoamerican Coral Reef System. Coastal environments along the land-sea gradient (wells, mangroves, beaches, submarine springs, the reef lagoon, and the open sea) were sampled. Silicate and salinity were used as tracers of groundwater and seawater, respectively. Their patterns evidence water flow and mixing among these coastal environments. High nitrate concentrations (268.6 mu M) and coliform bacteria densities indicate groundwater pollution in most of the wells sampled and also in mangroves, beaches, and submarine springs. Phosphorous content peaks (14.2 mu M) in mangroves, where it is likely released due to reducing conditions in the sediments. Nitrogen flux toward the lagoon reef through groundwater discharge is estimated at 2.4 ton N km(-1) year(-1) and phosphorous at 75 to 217 kg P km(-1) year(-1). These results provide evidence of the need for more detailed groundwater studies and for the integrated management of aquifers and coastal ecosystems in karstic regions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Four Mesozoic-Cenozoic palaeothermal episodes related to deeper burial and subsequent exhumation and one reflecting climate change during the Eocene have been identified in a study of new apatite fission-track analysis (AFTAR) and vitrinite reflectance data in eight Danish wells. The study combined thermal-history reconstruction with exhumation studies based on palaeoburial data (sonic velocities) and stratigraphic and seismic data. Mid-Jurassic exhumation (ca. 175 Ma) was caused by regional doming of the North Sea area, broadly contemporaneous with deep exhumation in Scandinavia. A palaeogeothermal gradient of 45 oC km-1 at that time may be related to a mantle plume rising before rifting in the North Sea. Mid-Cretaceous exhumation affecting the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone is probably related to late Albian tectonic movements (ca. 100 Ma). The Sole Pit axis in the southern North Sea experienced similar inversion and this suggests a plate-scale response along crustal weakness zones across NW Europe. Mid-Cenozoic exhumation affected the eastern North Sea Basin and the onset of this event correlates with a latest Oligocene unconformity (ca. 24 Ma), which indicates a major Scandinavian uplift phase. The deeper burial that caused the late Oligocene thermal event recognized in the AFTA data reflect progradation of lower Oligocene wedges derived from the uplifting Scandinavian landmass. The onset of Scandinavian uplift is represented by an earliest Oligocene unconformity (ca. 33 Ma). Late Neogene exhumation affected the eastern (and western) North Sea Basin including Scandinavia. The sedimentation pattern in the central North Sea Basin shows that this phase began in the early Pliocene (ca. 4 Ma), in good agreement with the AFTA data. These three phases of Cenozoic uplift of Scandinavia also affected the NE Atlantic margin, whereas an intra-Miocene unconformity (ca. 15 Ma) on the NE Atlantic margin reflects tectonic movements of only minor amplitude in that area. The study demonstrates that only by considering episodic exhumation as an inherent aspect of the sedimentary record can the tectonic evolution be accurately reconstructed.},

abstract = {Data analysis in combination with 2D basin modelling is used to study the hydrogeologic and hydrodynamic response of the basin fill of the Broad Fourteens Basin to its geodynamic evolution and the significance of this response for the evolution of the petroleum systems in the basin. Data analysis resulted in the identification of the major mechanical processes involved in overpressure and fluid flow evolution in the basin (sedimentary loading and unloading, tectonic compression and extension, topography of the groundwater table) and provided a timeframework for the important permeability alterations in the basin and the distinct phases of fluid flow. Observed present-day diagenetic features and fracture characteristics in the basin indicate permeability alterations and paleo fluid flow during distinct periods of tectonic activity in the basin, e.g. during Late Jurassic rifting and Late Cretaceous inversion. The basin boundary fault zones were repeatedly reactivated during the periods of tectonic activity. The 2D basin modelling included sedimentary loading and unloading, topography of the water table and petroleum generation as pressure and fluid flow influencing mechanisms. In addition, the influence of time-dependent permeability of fault zones on the overpressure history and the evolution of petroleum systems was modelled and evaluated. The favoured modelling scenario, including a time-dependent permeability of faults, shows that syn-rift and post-rift sedimentation in combination with gas generation induced overpressured conditions in restricted parts of the basin, that is mainly in the deeper low permeable Carboniferous shales and Zechstein evaporites. The calculated pre-inversion overpressured conditions disappear during subsequent inversion of the basin. Predicted present-day pressures in the reservoir horizons are near-hydrostatic and reasonably in accordance with observed pressures. The favoured scenario also explains the known location of oil fields, and the location and saturation characteristics of the gas occurrences. The model results further show that the difference in timing of oil charging of the P9 and Q1 Lower Cretaceous reservoirs explains the observed differences in geochemical composition of the accumulated oils. The biodegraded and water-washed nature of the Late Cretaceous charged Q1 oil reservoir is consistent with the concentrated topography-induced groundwater flow through Lower Cretaceous reservoir units during the Late Cretaceous inversion period. Late charging of the Lower Cretaceous oil reservoir in the P9 area explains the non-biodegraded character of the accumulated oils. In general, this paper shows the importance of using data analysis to obtain an a priori characterization of the basin geofluid evolution and shows that paleohydrodynamic conditions and time-dependent permeability of the hydrogeological framework have influenced significantly the petroleum systems in the basin.},

abstract = {Groundwater recharge at Mt. Hood, Oregon, is dominated by spring snow melt which provides a natural large-amplitude and narrow-width pore-fluid pressure signal. Time delays between this seasonal groundwater recharge and seismicity triggered by groundwater recharge can thus be used to estimate large-scale hydraulic diffusivities and the state of stress in the crust. We approximate seasonal variations in groundwater recharge with discharge in runoff-dominated streams at high elevations. We interpolate the time series of number of earthquakes, N, seismic moment, Mo, and stream discharge, Q, and determine cross-correlation coefficients at equivalent frequency bands between Q and both N and Mo. We find statistically significant correlation coefficients at a mean time lag of about 151 days. This time lag and a mean earthquake depth of about 4.5 km are used in the solution to the pressure diffusion equation, under periodic (1 year) boundary conditions, to estimate a hydraulic diffusivity of ?? ??? 10-1 m2/s, a hydraulic conductivity of about Kh ??? 10-7 m/s, and a permeability of about k ??? 10-15 m2. Periodic boundary conditions also allow us to determine a critical pore-fluid pressure fraction, P???/P0 ??? 0.1, of the applied near-surface pore-fluid pressure perturbation, P0 ??? 0.1 MPa, that has to be reached at the mean earthquake depth to cause hydroseismicity. The low magnitude of P??? ??? 0.01 MPa is consistent with other studies that propose 0.01 ??? P??? ??? 0.1 MPa and suggests that the state of stress in the crust near Mt. Hood could be near critical for failure. Therefore, we conclude that, while earthquakes occur throughout the year at Mt. Hood, elevated seismicity levels along pre-existing faults south of Mt.

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) geologic model of part of the northern Nevada rift encompassing the Beowawe geothermal system was developed from a series of two-dimensional (2D) geologic and geophysical models. The 3D model was constrained by local geophysical, geologic, and drill-hole information and integrates geologic and tectonic interpretations for the region. It places important geologic constraints on the extent and configuration of the active Beowawe geothermal system. The geologic framework represented in this model facilitates hydrologic modeling of the Beowawe geothermal system and evaluation of fluid flow in faults and adjacent rock units. Basin depths were determined using an iterative gravity-inversion technique that calculates the thickness of low-density, basin-filling deposits. The remaining subsurface structure was modeled using 2D potential-field modeling software. Crustal cross sections from the 2D models were generalized for use in the 3D model and consist of six stratigraphic layers defined as low-density basin sediments, volcanic rocks, basalt-andesite rocks of the northern Nevada rift, Jurassic and Cretaceous intrusive rocks, and Paleozoic siliceous and carbonate sedimentary rocks of the upper and lower plates of the Roberts Mountains allochthon, respectively. This simplified stratigraphy was combined with mapped surface geology and was extrapolated across the 3D model area. Features along the northern Nevada rift depicted by the model may represent preexisting crustal structures that controlled the locations and character of Tertiary tectonic and magmatic events related to Basin and Range extension and emplacement of the middle Miocene northern Nevada rift. Several of the geologic features represented are important components of the Beowawe geothermal system. Prominent ENE-trending faults (e. g., Malpais fault) that bound the southern edge of Whirlwind Valley, and older NNW-striking faults (e.g., Dunphy Pass and Muleshoe faults) that form major features of the model, are likely important pathways for geothermal fluids and groundwater flow from the Humboldt River, which may recharge the Beowawe system.},

abstract = {Influences of hydraulic conductivity {(K)} heterogeneities on bedrock groundwater {(BG)} flow systems in mountainous topography are investigated using a conceptual {2D} numerical modelling approach. A conceptual model for K heterogeneity in crystalline bedrock mountainous environments is developed based on a review of previous research, and represents heterogeneities due to weathering profile, bedrock fracture characteristics, and catchment-scale (∼0.1–1$\sim$km) structural features. Numerical groundwater modelling of K scenarios for hypothetical mountain catchment topography indicates that general characteristics of the {BG} flow directions are dominated by prominent topographic features. Within the modelled saturated {BG} flow system, ∼90$\sim$% or more of total {BG} flux is focussed within a fractured bedrock zone, extending to depths of ∼100–200$\sim$m below the ground surface, overlying {lower-K} bedrock. Structural features and heterogeneities, represented as discrete zones of higher or lower K relative to surrounding bedrock, locally influence {BG} flow, but do not influence general {BG} flow patterns or general positions of {BG} flow divides. This result is supported by similar {BG} transit-time distribution shapes and statistics for systems with and without structural features. The results support the development of topography-based methods for predicting general locations of {BG} flow-system boundaries in mountain regions.},

Numerical age estimates for the Aptian to Santonian stage boundaries follow published isotopic age determinations. The hypothesis of equal duration of ammonite zones is employed as a vernier to apportion time for the Hettangian to Oxfordian stages.

abstract = {The thermal and burial history of the Herzkamp syncline, located in the transition zone between the Variscan Rhenish Massif and the Ruhr foreland basin (western Germany), was reconstructed using PDI/PC-1D-basin modelling software (IES). The models were calibrated with new vitrinite reflectance data measured on Palaeozoic outcrop samples. High sample density and quality of the calibration data allowed a 3D reconstruction of the heat flow as well as of burial and erosion history. Vitrinite reflectance values range from 0.8 to 4.9%Rr and generally increase with increasing stratigraphic age. The coalification pattern confirms pre-tectonic maturation, especially in the western part of the study area. A "low-coalification zone" showing stagnating/decreasing coalification with increasing stratigraphic age exists, however, northeast of the Ennepe thrust, indicating synorogenic coalification. This anomaly is explained by early thrusting in the northern Rhenish Massif resulting in restricted burial/early uplift and thus lower thermal maturity. One result of numerical modelling is that palaeo-heat flows during maximum burial (Westphalian or post-Westphalian) decreased southwards from approximately 65 to less than 50 mW/m2. Maximum burial depths for the base and top of the Namurian also decrease southwards from 7000 to 3600 m and 4600 to 1800 m, respectively, resulting in southwards-decreasing coalification of the respective stratigraphic horizon. Eroded overburden increases southwards (3100-5700 m), with the exception of the low-coalification zone, which is characterised by lower amounts of eroded overburden (1300-2900 m) and an earlier onset of erosion, i.e. in the Westphalian B rather than Westphalian D or post-Westphalian.},

The submarine inputs of groundwater into Bangdu Bay of 120-180 m3 m-2 yr-1 (on the basis of 222Rn, 224Ra, 226Ra, and Si mass balances) were much higher than those reported from typical continental margins.

These excess nutrient inputs from SGD are the major sources of "new nutrients" in this bay. On the basis of photosynthetic pigments and benthic algal distributions, we suggest that the large fluxes of excess nutrients from SGD can cause benthic eutrophication in a semienclosed bay on this highly permeable volcanic island.},

@article{Reiners2009a,
abstract = {Thermochronologic data are typically interpreted as point- or path-wise constraints on monotonic cooling histories. This is at least partly because allowing for the possibility of nonmonotonic thermal histories both precludes straightfoward use of closure temperature (Tc) concepts and introduces ambiguities in modeling continuous time-temperature paths from multiple thermochronometers or closure profile, multi-domain, or fission-track length data. However, the monotonic cooling assumption severely limits the ability to elucidate reheating episodes with potentially important geologic significance. Here I show that in some cases multiple thermochronometers with contrasting kinetic properties can be used to both diagnose reheating events and constrain their duration and temperature. Thermochronometric systems with varying activation energies display "kinetic crossovers," whereby relative diffusivities are reversed at certain temperatures. For reheating events of certain durations and temperatures, this results in "inverted" ages, whereby systems with higher nominal Tcs have younger ages than systems with lower Tcs. However, even if reheating does not cause age inversion, in cases where two systems are partially reset and constraints on the timing of a reheating event are available, the relative fractional resetting extents can be inverted to estimate a square-pulse equivalent duration and temperature of the reheating event. Here I outline this approach for diagnosing nonmonotonic thermal histories and for deducing features of reheating events from thermochronometric data, and review several examples from previously published data that illustrate its use and potential in a range of applications. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Gasparini2004,
abstract = {We explore the link between channel-bed texture and river basin concavity in equilibrium catchments using a numerical landscape evolution model. Theory from homogeneous sediment transport predicts that river basin concavity directly increases with bed sediment size. If the effective grain size on a river bed governs its concavity, then natural phenomena such as grain-size sorting and channel armouring should be linked to concavity. We examine this hypothesis by allowing the bed sediment texture to evolve in a transport-limited regime using a two grain-size mixture of sand and gravel. Downstream ﬁning through selective particle erosion is produced in equilibrium. As the channel-bed texture adjusts downstream so does the local slope. Our model predicts that it is not the texture of the original sediment mixture that governs basin concavity. Rather, concavity is linked to the texture of the sorted surface layer. Two different textural regimes are produced in the experiments: a transitional regime where the mobility of sand and gravel changes with channel-bed texture, and a sand-dominated region where the mobility of sand and gravel is constant. The concavity of these regions varies depending on the median gravel- or sand-grain size, erosion rate, and precipitation rate. The results highlight the importance of adjustments in both surface texture and slope in natural rivers in response to changes in ﬂuvial and sediment inputs throughout a drainage network. This adjustment can only be captured numerically using multiple grain sizes or empirical downstream ﬁning rules. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Garven1992,
abstract = {Deep groundwater flow can be driven by several mechanisms in sedimentary basins. In the case of evolving foreland basins, large-scale compression and thrusting could develop abnormally high pressures in the foreland sag that would initiate transient fluid flow. The so-called tectonic "squeegee" effect is thought to have caused basin-wide migration of ore-forming brines and hydrocarbons (Oliver, 1986). Two-dimensional numerical models are developed here to quantify the role of cmnpressional tectonics in driving regional fluid flow in the later stages of thrusting in a foreland basin. Poroelasticity theory coupled with regional groundwater flow form the basic elements of the mathematical model. We use the mathematical model to predict deformation and pressure dissipation in the unfaulted and nonfolded part of a foreland basin in front of a thrust belt as it is subjected to an instantaneous loading event. Sets of numerical experiments show that overpressure zones develop along the leading edge of the thrust belt near the loading front. Stress-induced flow rates of the order of centimeters to meters per year are possible soon after compression of the foreland, and transient flow fields dissipate in about 103 and 10 4 years. Longer transients can exist in very low permeability strata. Large overpressures may be unable to buildup under conditions of gradual thrusting, as fluid pressures may dissipate too quickly. The general features of tectonically driven flow are also explored through a sensitivity study to consider effects of permeability, fault and stratigraphic heterogeneity, loading magnitude, and variations in rock compressibility. The sensitivity study is based mostly on numerical experiments. As these solutions suffered from stability problems in cases where bulk rock compressibility exceeded 10 -9 Pa -! , some simple scaling arguments are used to extend the numerical results for squeezing of soft shale. One basin-specific application to the Ouachita orogen suggests that tectonic squeezing could have caused transient flow systems with relatively large flow velocities in basal Cambro- Ordovician aquifers. The volume of fluid expelled, however, is probably only a small fraction of the total brine volume needed to have formed the huge Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc ore deposits fringing the northern margin of the Arkoma Basin on the Ozark Uplift.},

abstract = {This paper reports a new 1[degree sign] x 1[degree sign] global thermal model for the continental lithosphere (TC1). Geotherms for continental terranes of different ages (\textgreater 3.6 Ga to present) constrained by reliable data on borehole heat flow measurements (Artemieva, I.M., Mooney, W.D. 2001. Thermal structure and evolution of Precambrian lithosphere: a global study. J. Geophys. Res 106, 16387-16414.), are statistically analyzed as a function of age and are used to estimate lithospheric temperatures in continental regions with no or low-quality heat flow data (ca. 60% of the continents). These data are supplemented by cratonic geotherms based on electromagnetic and xenolith data; the latter indicate the existence of Archean cratons with two characteristic thicknesses, ca. 200 and \textgreater 250 km. A map of tectono-thermal ages of lithospheric terranes complied for the continents on a 1[degree sign] x 1[degree sign] grid and combined with the statistical age relationship of continental geotherms (z = 0.04 * t + 93.6, where z is lithospheric thermal thickness in km and t is age in Ma) formed the basis for a new global thermal model of the continental lithosphere (TC1). The TC1 model is presented by a set of maps, which show significant thermal heterogeneity within continental upper mantle, with the strongest lateral temperature variations (as large as 800 [degree sign]C) in the shallow mantle. A map of the depth to a 550 [degree sign]C isotherm (Curie isotherm for magnetite) in continental upper mantle is presented as a proxy to the thickness of the magnetic crust; the same map provides a rough estimate of elastic thickness of old (\textgreater 200 Ma) continental lithosphere, in which flexural rigidity is dominated by olivine rheology of the mantle. Statistical analysis of continental geotherms reveals that thick (\textgreater 250 km) lithosphere is restricted solely to young Archean terranes (3.0-2.6 Ga), while in old Archean cratons (3.6-3.0 Ga) lithospheric roots do not extend deeper than 200-220 km. It is proposed that the former were formed by tectonic stacking and underplating during paleocollision of continental nuclei; it is likely that such exceptionally thick lithospheric roots have a limited lateral extent and are restricted to paleoterrane boundaries. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the growth rate of the lithosphere since the Archean, which does not reveal a peak in lithospheric volume at 2.7-2.6 Ga as expected from growth curves for juvenile crust. A pronounced peak in the rate of lithospheric growth (10-18 km3/year) at 2.1-1.7 Ga (as compared to 5-8 km3/year in the Archean) well correlates with a peak in the growth of juvenile crust and with a consequent global extraction of massif-type anorthosites. It is proposed that large-scale variations in lithospheric thickness at cratonic margins and at paleoterrane boundaries controlled anorogenic magmatism. In particular, mid-Proterozoic anorogenic magmatism at the cratonic margins was caused by edge-driven convection triggered by a fast growth of the lithospheric mantle at 2.1-1.7 Ga. Belts of anorogenic magmatism within cratonic interiors can be caused by a deflection of mantle heat by a locally thickened lithosphere at paleosutures and, thus, can be surface manifestations of exceptionally thick lithospheric roots. The present volume of continental lithosphere as estimated from the new global map of lithospheric thermal thickness is 27.8 (+/- 7.0) x 109 km3 (excluding submerged terranes with continental crust); preserved continental crust comprises ca. 7.7 x 109 km3. About 50% of the present continental lithosphere existed by 1.8 Ga.},

abstract = {This work presents geochemistry and structural geology data concerning the low enthalpy geothermal circuits of the Argentera crystalline Massif in northwestern Italian Alps. I n this area some thermal springs (50-60 degreesC), located in the small Bagni di Vinadio village, discharge mixtures made up of a Na-Cl end-member and a Na-SO4 component. The latter is also discharged by the thermal springs of Terme di Valdieri located some kilometres apart within the same tectonic complex. Both end-members share the same meteoric origin and the same reservoir temperature, which is close to 150 degreesC. Explanations are thus required to understand how they reach the surface and how waters of the same origin and circulating in similar rocks can attain such different compositions. Sodium-sulphate waters discharged at both sites, likely represent the common interaction product of meteoric waters with the widespread granitic-migmatitic rocks of the Argentera Massif, whereas Na-CI waters originate through leaching of mineralised cataclastic rocks, which are rich in phyllosilicatic minerals and fluid inclusions, both acting as Cl- sources. Due to the relatively low inferred geothermal gradient of the region, -25C/km, meteoric waters have to descend to depths of 5.5-6 km to attain temperatures of similar to 150 degreesC. These relevant depths can be reached by descending meteoric waters, due to the recent extensional stress field, which allows the development of geothermal circulations at greater depths than in other sectors of the Alps by favouring a greater fractures aperture. The ascent of the thermal waters rakes place along brittle shear zones. In both sites, the thermal waters emerge at the bottoms of the valleys, close to either the lateral termination of a brittle shear zone at Terme di Valdieri, or a step-over between two en-echelon brittle shear zones at Bagni di Vinadio. These observations attest to a strong control operated on the location of outlet regions by both brittle tectonics and the minima in hydraulic potential inside the fractured massif.},

abstract = {Bending of oceanic plates at subduction zones results in extension and widespread normal faulting in the upper, brittle part of the slab. Detailed seismic surveys at trenches reveal that this part of the oceanic plate could be pervasively hydrated for several kilometres below the crust–mantle boundary. Similarly, heat-flow surveys indicate active fluid circulation within the slab. Yet, the mechanisms that enable fluids to percolate to such depths in spite of their natural buoyancy remain unclear. Here we use two-dimensional numerical experiments to show that stress changes induced by the bending oceanic plate produce subhydrostatic or even negative pressure gradients along normal faults, favouring downward pumping of fluids. The fluids then react with the crust and mantle surrounding the faults and are stored in the form of hydrous minerals. We suggest that this process is the dominant mechanism of deep slab hydration, although it may be locally aided by the enhancement in porosity due to prefailure dilatancy, pre-existing cracks and migrating fluid-filled cracks. Our results have implications for the transport of water into the deeper parts of the mantle, and for further clarifying the seismic anisotropy of slabs.},

abstract = {Detailed and preliminary field investigations delineating the most recent fault ruptures in vicinity of the Dixie Valley, Beowawe, and Bradys geothermal fields allow an assessment of static stress changes and their possible influences on the geothermal environments. Our models for the Dixie Valley and Beowawe regions show increased failure stress on faults and fractures associated with the geothermal reservoirs with contributions from both increased shear stress and decreased fault-normal stress. These stress changes are especially pronounced for the Dixie Valley geothermal field where large increases in failure stress are concentrated between Holocene rupture endpoints. The portion of the fault with the most enhanced tensile stresses lies at shallow crustal levels between the northern and southern limits of the production field. The sense of stress changes from both Holocene and historic fault ruptures in Dixie Valley are consistent with recent borehole studies of in situ stress and fracture permeability which show the Dixie Valley fault and fault-parallel fractures are critically stressed for failure and hydraulically conductive within the geothermal field. Structural relations in the Bradys geothermal field are analogous to the relations in Dixie Valley, and we suspect that a similar sense of stress change has influenced the Bradys geothermal environment. Our investigation shows that induced stress concentrations at the endpoints of normal fault ruptures may promote favorable conditions for hydrothermal activity. This may be accomplished in two ways: 1) Nearby fault ruptures may induce afteshocks associated with small amounts of slip on macro fractures along the fault and within the damage zone of the fault, thereby producing open fractures without producing large stress drops on the fault; and 2) If the geothermal field is adjacent to fault rupture endpoints, then it is conceivable that decreases in fault-normal stress may be large enough to produce significant increases in fracture dilatancy, thereby increasing hydraulic conductivity. Our studies illustrate that a detailed understanding of the neotectonic framework and the mechanics of faulting processes are fundamental to developing conceptual models for controls on the state of stress and fracture permeability in geothermal fields.},

abstract = {Isotope and geochemical techniques are the primary way in which the residence time, recharge conditions and subsequent evolution of palaeowaters can be determined. Isotopic species and noble gas concentrations are used as residence time and palaeoclimate indicators. Among the former, 14C is pre-eminent in late Quaternary studies because of an age range which covers the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. However, its use is constrained by frequent difficulties in determining the dilution of dissolved 14C due to water-rock interaction. A combination of 14C data with 226Ra and 4He results may be useful for Holocene waters but they can also be used to validate the carbon systematics assumed for 14C dating. For waters beyond the range of 14C dating, 81Kr, 36Cl, 4He and chemical tracers can be applied.Stable isotope ratios and noble gas concentrations primarily reflect climatic conditions at the time of recharge. While the noble gases provide absolute values for recharge temperatures, stable isotopes are only relative indicators that vary regionally. The PALAEAUX programme has examined these aspects in some detail by looking at the $\delta$18O shift between Pleistocene and Holocene waters on the European scale, and by calculating $\delta$18O/$\Delta$T ratios from $\delta$18O v. recharge temperature plots for aquifers at different distances from the Atlantic Ocean. Indications are that the more positive $\delta$18O value of ocean water during the Pleistocene dominates in the more westerly European countries over the negative $\delta$18O shift during cooler conditions. There are also indications that air-mass circulation during the Pleistocene was similar to the present day.The evolution of a palaeowater can best be studied by measuring chemical tracers; this is possible in freshwater aquifers, where a clear trend of geochemical reactions is observed, and in freshening marine aquifers. Chemical and isotopic tracers can also be used to study the movement of the front between palaeowater and younger components that must be identified in coastal aquifers to guarantee a sustainable water use. },

abstract = {In continental rift zones, thermal anomalies and enhanced occurrence of mantle-derived fluids in groundwaters often coincide on a continental but rarely on the local scale. For areas of recent intraplate volcanism this suggests a time shift between the transport of mantle-derived volatiles and heat to the Earth's surface. As a particularly illustrative example, we studied the central European Rhine graben, which is distinguished by extensional tectonics, high seismicity, young, Upper Tertiary volcanism, abundant mineral water springs, and a heat flow anomaly. A combination of thermal, helium isotope, and major element data of mineral waters with numerical simulations of flow and heat transport leads to a profound understanding of crustal-scale transport processes and allows a clear distinction between diffusion and flow dominated regimes. The simulations show that for a crustal-scale system the transition between these two regimes occurs within one decade of permeability (10−16–10−17 m2). Flow is likely to be strongly controlled by fault systems both in the lower and upper crust. While thermal anomalies highlight fluid circulation within the upper brittle crust, mantle-derived volatiles provide information on transport phenomena from lower crustal sections. The thermal and hydro-chemical anomalies in the Upper Rhine graben are directly related to mass flow rates. Therefore lack of thermal anomalies around the Kaiserstuhl volcano suggests that mass flow rates must be very small, while positive thermal anomalies in the central part of the graben can directly be related to advection of fluids into basin sediments and to redistribution of heat within these sediments.},

abstract = {After a short-lived but very successful phase of exploration in the UK North Sea, the need for extreme confidentiality ceased to exist for those fields that had already been discovered, including the gas fields of the southern North Sea; this led to a widespread dissemination of data from 1974 onwards, to the great benefit of the industry as a whole. Early difficulties in producing gas from reservoirs whose permeability had been reduced by the growth of diagenetic illite led to studies in depth- and facies-related diagenesis, which continues today in different parts of the Southern Permian Basin. A change from analogue to digital recording of seismic data coincided with improvements in computer technology, and transformed seismic from a tool with limited depth penetration, which required the skill of a dedicated specialist to interpret, to one that today is used universally by all exploration and production geologists; these advances led, in turn, to much improved stratigraphic and structural resolution.  Recent studies, especially in the former East Germany, have led to a better definition of the Permian. In Central Germany, Lower Rotliegend volcanics are overlain by sedimentary sequences of the Muritz sub-group (Upper Rotliegend 1), which are coeval coveal part of the combined Altmark and Saalian Unconformity. In northern Germany, this major hiatus is overlain by the Havel and Elbe subgroups (Upper Rotliegend 2) which, together with the succeeding Zechstein sequences, were all deposited within the youngest stages of the Permian, covering a probable time span of no more than 16 Ma. Deposition of up to 4000 m or so of Late Permian strata in such a short time indicates structurally controlled subsidence in addition to any of a thermal nature.},

abstract = {The Rhinegraben is the central segment of a rift system which traverses Western Europe from the North Sea to the Mediterranean. Rifting, which had started in the Middle Eocene, was preceded by early-Teriary nephelinitic eruptions. The center of maximum subsidence shifted along the graben axis from south to north during geologic times. The maximum thickness of sedimentary fill is observed in the northern part of the Rhinegraben to be as much as 3350 m. Most of the internal and external faults are normal faults. By theoretically returning the dip-slip movements and tilted block tectonics back to their original positions a lateral gap can be calculated in the amount of 4.8 km. The graben shoulders began to rise along the marginal fault scarps as outward tilted blocks contemporaneously when fault trough subsidence set in. The graben sinking and shoulder uplift are still in progress. Rates of annual vertical movements up to 0.7 mm, as well as seismic activity, are observed. Below both graben and shoulders a cushion-shaped body has been ascertained, intercalated between crust and mantle, with P-velocities of 7.6–7.7 km s-1. This body is interpreted to be of mantle-derived material; its crest follows the graben axis and ascends up to 24 km beneath the graben floor. It is thought that rifting, like graben subsidence and shoulder elevation, is controlled by the formation and growth of this laccolithic body. Tensional tectonics and sideward plate movements are reduced to gravity slide of the torn and upwarped crustal plates or sub-plates, decoupled from the substratum by heat transfer and consequential partial melting along the cushion surface. The lateral offsets at the transitions from the Rhinegraben to its continual segments are intersected by transversal zones of enhanced seismicity and volcanic action. The observed fault patterns are interpreted as crustal traces of subcrustal transform faulting. Rhine graben tectonism is discussed as to its local interference and temporal interaction with Alpine orogenesis, just as in its causal and spatial connection to the world rift system as a whole, Several arguments pertaining to the understanding of the driving mechanisms are discussed and a new model of rift tectonics is indicated.},

Earlier models of the basin had difficulty reproducing these features without any hydrochemical data to constrain the rates and distribution of recharge. The objective of this study was to use the large quantity of available hydrochemical data to help calibrate the model parameters, including the recharge rates. The model was constructed using the US Geological Survey's software MODFLOW, MODPATH, and UCODE, and calibrated using 14C activities and the positions of certain flow zones defined by the hydrochemical data. Parameter estimation was performed using a combination of nonlinear regression techniques and a manual search for the minimum difference between field and simulated observations. The calibrated recharge values were substantially smaller than those used in previous models. Results from a 30,000-year transient simulation suggest that recharge was at a maximum about 20,000 years ago and at a minimum about 10,000 years ago.},

abstract = {Abstract Vitrinite reflectance data from a petroleum exploration well in the northern Upper Rhinegraben show an unusual vertical maturity trend. Above and below a 500 m thick marl layer the vitrinite reflectance levels are consistent with modern, conductive, geothermal gradients. Between about 1000 and 1500 m depth, however, vitrinite reflectance levels are significantly elevated (about 0.6%Ro). This anomaly cannot be explained with one-dimensional conductive or conductive-convective heat transfer models, and thermal effects of sedimentation or igneous intrusion seem implausible for this geological setting. The thermal anomaly that formed this maturation anomaly must have been hydrothermal in origin, two-dimensional in nature, and persisted long enough to elevate the vitrinite reflectance values within this marl unit, yet it must have dissipated before the thermal perturbation would have altered the organic matter below and above the unit. In this study, we propose that the vitrinite reflectance anomalies were caused by a transient thermal inversion induced by episodic, lateral flow of hot (130-160oC) groundwater along conductive fractures and bedding planes. Heat flow constraints suggest that fluids must have moved rapidly up a vertical feeder fault from a depth of at least 3.6 km before migrating laterally. To test this hypothesis, we present a suite of simple, idealized mathematical models of groundwater flow, heat transfer, thermal degradation of kerogen and vitrinite systematics to explore the episodic flow that could have produced the observed thermal anomaly. In these simulations, a single, horizontal aquifer is sandwiched between two less permeable units: the total dimensions of the vertical section model are 4 km thick by 10 km long. The top of the aquifer coincides with the position of the observed thermal maturity anomaly in the Rhinegraben. Boundary conditions along the left edge of this aquifer were varied through time to allow for the migration of hot fluids out into the basin. Inflow temperature, horizontal velocity, duration and frequency of flow and thickness of the aquifer were varied. We found that a thermal maturity anomaly could only be produced by a rather restrictive set of hydrothermal conditions. It was possible to produce the observed vitrinite reflectance anomaly by a single hydrothermal flow event of 130oC fluid migrating laterally into the aquifer at a rate of 1 m a-1 for about 10 000 years. The anomaly is spatially confined to near the left edge of the basin, near the feeder fault. If the flow event lasted longer than 100 000 years, then the maturation anomaly disappeared as the lower confining unit approached steady-state thermal conditions. It is possible that such an event occurred about 5 million years ago in response to increases in fault permeability associated with far field Alpine tectonism.},

abstract = {The conventional view of the climatic influence on weathering is that weathering rates are strongly temperature-dependent due to the near-exponential relationship (Clausius-Clapeyron) between temperature and the saturation vapor pressure of water, and hence precipitation and runoff. This is a central theme in the Earth 'thermostat' model, i.e., weathering of aluminosilicate rocks on continents acts through the greenhouse effect as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2. However, there is very little direct field evidence to support this hypothesis. To remedy the lack of systematic geochemical data for cold high latitude rivers as compared to the tropics, large, pristine drainages of Eastern Siberia have been studied. Here, data from basement terrains of the Siberian Craton are reported. The low Si to total cation suggest a superficially weathered system. The total dissolved solids flux of 0.39 X 106 mol/km2/yr and the CO2 uptake flux of 149 X 103 mol/km2/yr are similar to those of the tropical cratonic systems and the collisional/accretionary zone of northeastern Siberia, but about a factor of 3 lower than for the orogenic zones of the western Americas at both low and high latitudes. The lack of systematic climatic effects on the solute and CO2 fluxes is ascribed to the unique non-glacial frost shattering processes which continuously expose fresh rock surfaces and, thus, overcome the effect of temperature inhibition on high-latitude shields and to the lateritic cover that seals in the weathering front away from the weathering agents on the tropical shields. No primary climatic effects on weathering rates on the present Earth were detected.},

abstract = {Suspended sediments from 34 major rivers (geographically widespread)and 36 glacial meltwater streams have been examined for their variations in different operationally-defined iron fractions; FeHR (iron oxides soluble in dithionite), FePR (iron soluble in boiling HCl but not in dithionite) and FeU (total iron less that soluble in boiling HCl). River particulates show a close association between FeHR and total iron (FeT), reflecting the effects of chemical weathering which derive oxide iron\r\nfrom, and retain it in close association with, total iron. Consistent with this, continentalscale\r\naverage FeHR/FeT ratios vary with runoff ratios (average river runoff per unit\r\narea/average precipitation per unit area). By contrast, the diminished effects of\r\nchemical weathering produce no recognizable association of FeHR with FeT in glacial\r\nparticulates, and instead both FePR and FeU are closely correlated with FeT, reflecting\r\nessentially pristine mineralogy. A comparison of the globally-averaged compositions of\r\nriverine particulates and marine sediments reveals that the latter are depleted in FeHR,\r\nFePR and FeT but enriched in FeU. The river and glacial particulate data are combined\r\nwith estimates of authigenic, hydrothermal, atmospheric and coastal erosive iron\r\nfluxes from the literature to produce a global budget for FeHR, FePR, FeU and FeT.\r\nThis budget suggests that the differences between riverine particulates and marine\r\nsediments can be explained by; (i) preferentially removing FeHR from the riverine\r\nparticulate flux by deposition into inner shore reservoirs such as floodplains, salt\r\nmarshes and estuaries; and (ii) mixing the resulting riverine particulates with FeHRdepleted\r\nglacial particulates. Preliminary measurements of inner shore sediments are\r\nconsistent with (i) above. Phanerozoic and modern normal marine sediments have\r\nsimilar iron speciation characteristics, which implies the existence of a long-term\r\nsteady state for the iron cycle. This steady state could be maintained by a glacioeustatic\r\nfeedback, where FeHR-enriched riverine particulates are either more effectively trapped\r\nwhen sealevel is high (small ice masses, diminished glacial erosion), or are mixed with\r\ngreater masses of FeHR-depleted glacial particulates when sealevel is low (large ice\r\nmasses, enhanced glacial erosion). Further important controls on the steady state for FeHR operate through the formation of euxinic sediments and ironstones, which also\r\nprovide sealevel-dependent sinks for FeHR-enriched sediment.},

We show here that when data relative to fractures are collected along a line such as a road or a well, estimations can be given to the major geometrical properties of the corresponding fracture networks, such as the volumetric density of fractures, their percolation character and their macroscopic permeability. All these formulae are analytical and can be split into two parts; the first one can be derived from the measured data, while the second one requires some assumption on the lateral extension of the fractures and on their permeability. All these techniques are applied to fractures located in the Baget watershed. They are also validated on a granite block whose structure is fully known. Extensions are proposed for networks with variable permeabilities and polydisperse fractures.},

abstract = {Extensional-type geothermal systems are complicated by the interrelation between footwall advection during exhumation, and the subsequent redistribution of heat by migrating hydrothermal fluids in the hanging wall. The southern Wassuk Range (WR) hanging wall hosts a moderate-temperature, extensional-type geothermal system and is ideal for studying this duality by analyzing a suite of apatite (AHe) and zircon (ZHe) helium samples from the footwall and hanging wall of the southern WR. Young ($\sim$. 3-4. Ma) AHe ages along the WR front are concentrated along the SE corners of segmented footwall blocks, marking the location of focused Mio-Pliocene transtension, fracture dilation, and advection. Hydrothermally reset AHe ages along the footwall range front suggest that the Hawthorne geothermal system (85??-135??. C) is long lived and has resided at a prominent structural boundary in the WR footwall marked by localized advection and range-front deformation. In contrast, the presence of both hydrothermally reset and non-reset AHe ages from a $\sim$. 1.4. km deep borehole in the hanging-wall basin probably indicate that the geothermal plumbing system and current manifestation as a thermal anomaly ($\sim$. 113. ??C) are juvenile and are controlled by the generation of newly formed faults in the hanging wall. AHe ages have been shown here to greatly enhance the focusing of regional-scale geothermal exploration efforts, and for the first time have been used to identify and estimate the temperature of unseen hydrothermal fluids. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Merksplas-Beerse well (North Belgium) is a low-enthalpy geothermal production well targeting the Dinantian karstic limestones to a total depth of 1761 m. The presence of methane gas in these limestones generated a particular interest in this well. This paper describes the geological profile of this well and the Dinantian reservoir. The Namurian-Visean boundary at 1630 m is determined by the base of the dipmeter draping pattern in the radioactive Chokier shales (base of the Namurian) on top of the karstified Dinantian limestone. The stratigraphic composition of the transitional interval from Dinantian to Silesian correlates closely to the nearby Turnhout well. The two fractured intervals at 1630-1656 and 1739-1747 m respectively were identified in the Dinantian limestones. They are associated with siliciclastic sections in between pure limestones. The reservoir water is a sodium chloride brine of about 74°C and at a pressure below the hydrostatic. The water is slightly radioactive because of the contact with the Chokier hot shales. A carbon dioxide gas with methane and nitrogen admixture is dissolved in the water. The gas liquid ratio at standard conditions is about one and the bubble point is around 200-400 psi at reservoir temperature. A long duration pumping test shows a high fracture permeability and a productivity index of 5.4 m3/h/bar with a productivity to injectivity ratio of 1.45.},

abstract = {We have undertaken a thorough inventory of the structural settings of known geothermal systems (>400 total) in the extensional to transtensional terrane of the Great Basin in the western USA. Of the more than 200 geothermal fields catalogued to date, we found that step-overs or relay ramps in normal fault zones served as the most favorable structural setting, hosting $\sim$32% of the systems. Such areas are characterized by multiple, commonly overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability. Other common settings include a) intersections between normal faults and either transversely oriented strike-slip or oblique-slip faults (22%), where multiple minor faults typically connect major structures and fluids can flow readily through highly fractured, dilational quadrants, and b) normal fault terminations or tip-lines (22%), where horse-tailing generates a myriad of closely-spaced faults and thus increased permeability. A major subset of fault intersections includes displacement transfer zones (5%) between strike-slip faults in the Walker Lane and N- to NNE-striking normal faults, with geothermal systems commonly focused along the normal faults proximal to their dilational intersections with nearby dextral faults. Other notable structural settings for geothermal systems in the Great Basin include accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing, oppositely dipping normal faults; 8%), major range-front faults (3%), salients or apices of major normal faults (3%), and pull-aparts in strike-slip fault systems (4%). Pull aparts and displacement transfer zones are more abundant within or along the margins of the Walker Lane, whereas step-overs and accommodation zones in normal fault systems are more prevalent within the extensional terrane that characterizes much of the Great Basin northeast of the Walker Lane. In addition, Quaternary faults typically lie within or near most of the geothermal systems. However, geothermal systems appear to be rare along the displacement-maxima zones or mid-segments of major normal faults (i.e., major range-front faults), possibly due to both reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes. Step-overs, terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones in normal fault systems would tend to correspond to long-term, critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways would more likely remain open in networks of closely-spaced, breccia-dominated fractures. It is also important to note that many of the higher enthalpy systems are characterized by more than one type of favorable setting at a single locality (e.g., Steamboat, Brady's, and Salt Wells).},

abstract = {Groundwater is the world's largest accessible source of freshwater to satisfy human water needs. Moreover, groundwater buffers variable precipitation rates over time, thereby effectively sustaining river flows in times of droughts and evaporation in areas with shallow water tables. In this study, building on previous work, we simulate groundwater head fluctuations and groundwater storage changes in both confined and unconfined aquifer systems using a global-scale high-resolution (5′) groundwater model by deriving new estimates of the distribution and thickness of confining layers. Inclusion of confined aquifer systems (estimated 6–20% of the total aquifer area) improves estimates of timing and amplitude of groundwater head fluctuations and changes groundwater flow paths and groundwater-surface water interaction rates. Groundwater flow paths within confining layers are shorter than paths in the underlying aquifer, while flows within the confined aquifer can get disconnected from the local drainage system due to the low conductivity of the confining layer. Lateral groundwater flows between basins are significant in the model, especially for areas with (partially) confined aquifers were long flow paths crossing catchment boundaries are simulated, thereby supporting water budgets of neighboring catchments or aquifer systems. The developed two-layer transient groundwater model is used to identify hot-spots of groundwater depletion. Global groundwater depletion is estimated as 7013  km3 (137  km3y−1) over 1960–2010, which is consistent with estimates of previous studies.},

abstract = {In high-temperature geothermal fields, precipitation of amorphous silica from solution to form silica scales is the main obstacle to efficient heat extraction from the hot fluids. The silica deposits cause operational problems and may even clog pipelines and injection drillholes. The rate of silica-scale formation can be reduced by ageing amorphous silica super-saturated waters, thus allowing the aqueous silica in excess of saturation to polymerize. Polymeric silica shows less tendency to precipitate from solution than monomeric silica. Studies of separated water from the Nesjavellir geothermal power station, Iceland, indicate that silica-scale formation can be avoided during heat extraction by rapid cooling of the water in “capillary heat exchangers”, followed by ageing the water for 1–2h and subsequently mixing it with condensed steam. It is thus possible to avoid scale formation during injection of the amorphous silica super-saturated water leaving the heat exchanger.},

abstract = {Mountain topography creates variations in water-table elevation that drive groundwater flow. Consequently, advective heat transport by topography-driven fluid flow can modify the crustal thermal field and bias exhumation rates calculated from thermochronometer data. Although previous studies have considered the thermal effects of fluid flow, none has quantified the influence on thermochronometer ages. We use a steady-state three-dimensional coupled hydraulic thermokinematic finite-element model to simulate the influence of fluid flow on exhumation rates derived from thermochronometer data in the Nepalese Himalaya. Local hot springs suggest substantial heat transport by fluid flow and are adjacent to apatite fission-track samples. Model hydraulic conductivity controls the rate of fluid flow, and values characteristic of fractured rock (&#62;&#62;10&#8722;9 m/s) yield a fluid advection&#8211;dominated thermal field. Hydraulic conductivity is estimated by minimizing the misfit between predicted and observed hot spring thermal power. The best-fit hydraulic conductivity value of &#8764;5 &#215; 10&#8722;7 m/s produces a fluid advection&#8211;dominated thermal field and older predicted apatite fission-track ages. To fit the observed age-elevation relationship, model-predicted ages require denudation rates that are &#8764;5 mm/yr, &#8764;200&#37; higher than predictions from thermal models that do not simulate fluid flow. Thus, true exhumation rates can be substantially underestimated in orogenic systems where fluid advection is significant.},

We obtained high-resolution profiles of salinity from the entire coastal area of Jeju Island using accurate CTD sensors. Lower salinity anomalies relative to the pristine offshore seawaters were observed and assumed to be a result of SFGD on the basis of negligible surface runoffs from the island and the relatively high levels of 222Rn in the low-salinity waters. The SFGD flux during the study period calculated from a freshwater budget of the water column was 2.5-3.8 × 106 m3 d-1, which is close to the long-term average based on the inland water balance. Our study shows that SFGD can be accurately and easily measured using a freshwater budget of the coastal waters off a highly permeable coastal zone with little surface runoff.

abstract = {The spatial distribution of groundwater age is a key factor determining the distribution of dissolved contaminants in the subsurface when contamination loadings have increased in time. The effects of surficial drainage and aquifer heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of groundwater age in unconsolidated aquifers in flat areas were investigated, and consequences were presented for the monitoring of contaminants from diffuse sources. First, the effects were assessed using model simulations. Second, the groundwater age distribution was evaluated in the two regional monitoring networks of Noord-Brabant and Drenthe using tritium measurements. Theoretically, a simple spatial distribution of groundwater age is present in homogeneous aquifers with natural groundwater recharge, characterized by a horizontal pattern of residence time isochrones and a gradual increase of groundwater age with depth. The model simulations show that the isochrone pattern becomes distorted in areas with a surficial drainage network, resulting in relatively old groundwater at shallow depth and larger spatial variation in groundwater age at a specific depth. This drainage effect on the spatial distribution of groundwater age is relatively large compared with effects of regional scale aquifer heterogeneity or spatially varying groundwater recharge. The effects of surficial drainage on the spatial distribution of groundwater age were confirmed by tritium measurements made in the regional monitoring networks of two provinces in the Netherlands. At about 24 m depth, the proportion of post-1950 groundwater in drained areas was significantly less and the spatial variation of groundwater age was larger than in recharge areas that lack a drainage network. The age of the groundwater appeared to be related to the drainage network density and the water table regime. A preliminary survey showed that contamination patterns in the two networks agree well with the proportion of post-1950 groundwater.},

abstract = {At depths in the crust greater than perhaps 1 km, local melting with production of pseudotachylyte should take place on fault planes during seismic faulting. But, although many ancient fault zones are now exposed at erosion levels which correspond to depths of several kilometres when the faults were active, very few of them contain pseudotachylyte; it has been suggested that the general absence of this material on fault planes puts an upper limit on the magnitude of shear stresses associated with earthquake faulting. In refs 1–4 earthquake fault models with heat generated by dry frictional sliding on a single plane across which there is a constant normal stress are used. Two other factors are probably dominant in controlling the temperature rise on a fault, and the second has important implications with regard to the seismic source mechanism, and the nature of cataclastic rocks produced by rapid faulting.},

abstract = {Permeability of kaolinite was found to decrease markedly as the polarity of the permeating fluid increased. The permeability to dry nitrogen gas, for example, was almost 20 times greater than to dilute aqueous sodium versenate solution, when measured at equal void ratios. Variation of permeability with void ratio was found to disagree wth the Kozeny- Carman equation. However, the specific surface area of the clay, as calculated from this equation, was found to be a linear function of void ratio for all permeant fluids for void ratios greater than unity. Replacement of a polar permeant fluid by a nonpolar one by gradual desolvation of a confined clay bed resulted in only a small increase in permeability; signifi- cant (10 to 30%) increases were noted only when water or sodium versenate solutions were the initial permeant fluids. The most important factor controlling kaolinite permeability appears to be the degree of dispersion or disaggregation taking place in the original suspend- ing fluid. Colloidal effects, such as adsorbed liquid surface films, appear to have little effect on permeability. Electroosmotic counterflow may be of some importance when aqueous solutions are used as permeant fluids, but this phenomenon can account for less than 30% of the total resistance to fluid flow. Thus, while the permeability of compacted clay can be reduced by permeating the bed with liquids of high dispersive power, the possibility of signifi- cantly increasing the permeability of such a clay by altering the permeant fluid seems remote. atudy for many years, and for many systems succes},

abstract = {Empirical sensitivity analyses are important for evaluation of the effects of a changing climate on water resources and ecosystems. Although mechanistic models are commonly applied for evaluation of climate effects for snowmelt, empirical relationships provide a first-order validation of the various postulates required for their implementation. Previous studies of empirical sensitivity for April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western United States were developed by regressing interannual variations in SWE to winter precipitation and temperature. This offers a temporal analog for climate change, positing that a warmer future looks like warmer years. Spatial analogs are used to hypothesize that a warmer future may look like warmer places, and are frequently applied alternatives for complex processes, or states/metrics that show little interannual variability (e.g. forest cover). We contrast spatial and temporal analogs for sensitivity of April 1 SWE and the mean residence time of snow (SRT) using data from 524 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western US. We built relatively strong models using spatial analogs to relate temperature and precipitation climatology to snowpack climatology (April 1 SWE, R2=0.87, and SRT, R2=0.81). Although the poorest temporal analog relationships were in areas showing the highest sensitivity to warming, spatial analog models showed consistent performance throughout the range of temperature and precipitation. Generally, slopes from the spatial relationships showed greater thermal sensitivity than the temporal analogs, and high elevation stations showed greater vulnerability using a spatial analog than shown in previous modeling and sensitivity studies. The spatial analog models provide a simple perspective to evaluate potential futures and may be useful in further evaluation of snowpack with warming.},

abstract = {A simple model for the development and evolution of sedimentary basins is proposed. The first event consists of a rapid stretching of continental lithosphere, which produces thinning and passive upwelling of hot asthenosphere. This stage is associated with block faulting and subsidence. The lithosphere then thickens by heat conduction to the surface, and further slow subsidence occurs which is not associated with faulting. The slow subsidence and the heat flow depend only on the amount of stretching, which can be estimated from these quantities and from the change in thickness of the continental crust caused by the extension. The model is therefore easily tested. Preliminary investigations of the Great Basin, the Aegean, the North Sea and the Michigan Basin suggest that the model can account for the major events in their evolution.},

The results show differences in geological histories. The coalification of the Westphalian A and B strata in KB174 (0.66–0.98% Ro) was pre-Permian. Calculated maximum temperatures, based on borehole data and vitrinite reflectance, regional thicknesses and a heat flow of 84 mW/m2 during the Late Westphalian, range from 110 °C at the top to 175 °C at the bottom of the Westphalian cored in this borehole. The high coalification (0.85–1.30% Ro) of the Westphalian C and D strata in KB172 could be the result of the deposition of $\sim$2500 m of Upper Permian to Middle Jurassic sediments in combination with elevated heat flows (71–80 mW/m2). Two coalification periods, i.e. Late Westphalian and Middle Jurassic, are suggested for this borehole. The simulated maximum temperatures range from 130 °C at the top to 175 °C at the bottom of the investigated Westphalian C and D. The differences in the burial and thermal histories of both boreholes can be related to the activity of the transversal Donderslag Fault, a major structural element in the Campine coalfield, and the Roer Valley Graben.},

Today, the budget needs revisiting to incorporate advances that have notably changed estimates of river and groundwater inputs to the ocean of dissolved silicon and easily dissolvable amorphous silica, inputs from the dissolution of terrestrial lithogenic silica in ocean margin sediments, reverse weathering removal fluxes, and outputs of biogenic silica (especially on ocean margins and in the form of nondiatomaceous biogenic silica). The resulting budget recognizes significantly higher input and output fluxes and notes that the recycling of silicon occurs mostly at the sediment-water interface and not during the sinking of silica particles through deep waters.},

abstract = {The Dutch2014German border region near the city of Roermond, The Netherlands was hit by a rather strong crustal earthquake at 1:20 UT, 1992 April 13. The epicentre is located within the Roer Valley Graben, a region currently undergoing extension. The centroidal source mechanism of this event has been retrieved by moment tensor inversion of broad-band long-period surface waves recorded at regional distances (10020131500 km). The double-couple contribution of the moment tensor corresponds to almost pure normal faulting (rake: 262�) on a steeply south-westward dipping fault (dip: 58�) with a NW-SE trend (strike: 138�). This result is consistent with local tectonics but violates some first-motion P-wave polarity data. The deduced seismic moment is 9.2 � 1016 N m corresponding to a moment magnitude of 5.3. A centroidal depth of 18 km fits slightly better than 13 km; however, the differences are small and other methods are necessary to constrain the depth further. It is now possible to access a number of broad-band three-component seismic stations in Europe via phone line (e.g. German Regional Seismic Network) and the ORFEUS data centre (i.e. Global Digital Seismic Network). This allows retrieval of waveform data immediately after an earthquake. In this paper we present a potentially fast and reliable procedure for extracting the moment tensor from low-frequency surface waves using the Roermond earthquake as an example. Detailed knowledge of the velocity-depth structure along the travel paths seems unnecessary with our procedure. Further testing is required on all future moderate to strong earthquakes in Europe using rapidly accessible stations to investigate the procedure's usefulness and possible limitations as a tool for rapid moment tensor estimation.},

Seismic profiles on the inner shelf of the Gulf of Lions (W. Mediterranean) display a giant atypical sub-circular structure, up to 800-m thick and 2-km wide. It is characterized by down-warped internal seismic reflections forming a concave V-shaped depression rooted in the substratum, most likely carbonated. This structure is interpreted as a poly-phased solution-subsidence/collapse structure of Plio-Quaternary age. The last phase of deformation probably occurred during the last sea-level low-stand phase. The mechanism proposed for the creation of this structure is collapse/dissolution of the soluble substratum, as a result of a combination of several possible factors including pre-existing deep Messinian palaeo-karst with active groundwater flows during Plio-Quaternary lowstands, and deep-rooted acidic fluids ascending through the substratum.},

The hypothesis that this increase results from climate-change impacts on erosion rate over the past ∼5 Ma is testable, given the extensive work completed in the Alps. Sediment budgets, thermochronology-based cooling rates, and estimates of modern rock uplift and erosion in the Western Alps are reviewed to search for correlation in space and time that might fingerprint climatic events. Major increases in sediment yield are apparent starting in the late Messinian (5.5 Mya) and accelerating toward the present day; this suggests the occurrence of a series of climatic changes that increased erosion rates, even as tectonic processes appear to have slowed or stopped. At present, tight correlations in time are difficult to establish and there remain open questions about the role of tectonics in the coupled system.},

abstract = {Both terrestrial and marine forces drive underground fluid flows in the coastal zone. Hydraulic gradients on land result in groundwater seepage near shore and may contribute to flows further out on the shelf from confined aquifers. Marine processes such as tidal pumping and current-induced pressure gradients may induce interfacial fluid flow anywhere on the shelf where permeable sediments are present. The terrestrial and oceanic forces overlap spatially so measured fluid advection through coastal sediments may be a result of composite forcing. We thus define ``submarine groundwater discharge'' (SGD) as any and all flow of water on continental margins from the seabed to the coastal ocean, regardless of fluid composition or driving force. SGD is typically characterized by low specific flow rates that make detection and quantification difficult. However, because such flows occur over very large areas, the total flux is significant. Discharging fluids, whether derived from land or composed of re-circulated seawater, will react with sediment components. These reactions may increase substantially the concentrations of nutrients, carbon, and metals in the fluids. These fluids are thus a source of biogeochemically important constituents to the coastal ocean. Terrestrially-derived fluids represent a pathway for new material fluxes to the coastal zone. This may result in diffuse pollution in areas where contaminated groundwaters occur. This paper presents an historical context of SGD studies, defines the process in a form that is consistent with our current understanding of the driving forces as well as our assessment techniques, and reviews the estimated global fluxes and biogeochemical implications. We conclude that to fully characterize marine geochemical budgets, one must give due consideration to SGD. New methodologies, technologies, and modeling approaches are required to discriminate among the various forces that drive SGD and to evaluate these fluxes more precisely.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 2172013233 Permeability enhancement associated with deformation processes in faults and shear zones plays a key role in facilitating fluid redistribution between fluid reservoirs in the crust. Especially in high fluid flux hydrothermal systems, fracture-controlled permeability can be relatively short-lived, unless it is repeatedly regenerated by ongoing deformation. Failure mode diagrams in pore fluid factor and differential stress space, here termed 03BB201303C3 failure mode diagrams, provide a powerful tool for analysing how fluid pressure and stress states drive failure, associated permeability enhancement and vein styles during deformation in faults and shear zones. During fault-valve behaviour in the seismogenic regime, relative rates of recovery of pore fluid factor, differential stress and fault cohesive strength between rupture events impact on styles of veining and associated, fracture-controlled permeability enhancement in faults and shear zones. Examples of vein-rich fault zones are used to illustrate how constraints can be placed, not just on fluid pressure and stress states at failure, but also on the fluid pressurization and loading paths associated with failure and transitory permeability enhancement in faults and shear zones. This provides insights about when, during the fault-valve cycle, various types of veins can form. The use of failure mode diagrams also provides insights about the relative roles of optimally oriented faults and misoriented faults as hydraulically conductive structures. The analysis highlights the dynamics of competition between fluid pressures and loading rates in driving failure and repeated permeability regeneration in fracture-controlled, hydrothermal systems.},

abstract = {Groundwater Discharge (SGD) has been frequently ignored as a nutrient source to marine ecosystems because it is difficult to identify and quantify. However, recent studies show its ubiquity and ecological importance to the coastal zone, particularly when associated with contaminated continental aquifers. The Ria Formosa is a coastal lagoon located in the south of Portugal and sur- rounded by an intensely farmed area. Following a 12-month field study using seepage meters, we identified groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone of the lagoon. The seeping fluid was a mixture of two water types: one with low salinity and high nitrate concentration and another similar to local seawater. Based on the integration of monthly seepage rate measurements throughout the year, we estimate the mean discharge of submarine ground- water into the lagoon to be 3.6 m3 day-1 per linear meter of coastline with freshwater contributions (per volume) ranging from 10% to 50%. The results of this study suggest a continental origin for the freshwater component, thus linking the biogeochem- ical cycles in the lagoon to anthropogenic activities taking place in the neighboring coastal plain. We further identify SGD as an important nutrient source to the Ria Formosa, estimating annual loads of 36.2 mol (0.507 kg) of Nitrogen, 1.1 mol (0.034 kg) of Phosphorus and 18.6 mol (0.522 kg) of Silicon per meter of coastline. Based on these results, we suggest that SGD is a potential contributor to the observed nutrification status of the Ria Formosa lagoon.},

abstract = {A finite difference model is presented, describing the thermal structure of a region undergoing fault-controlled extension. The model is two-dimensional and time-dependent. We combine temperature changes resulting from conduction, advection due to fault movements, sediment blanketing and heat production. Cooling curves can be derived at chosen points in the area. This study mainly investigates the effect of the extension rate on the thermal field, which turns out to be very important. 20 km of extension with extension rates of 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mm/yr yield maximum deviations in temperatures from the steady-slate situation of 2, 26 and 84%. The sediment blanketing effect can even be reversed by variations in the sedimentation rates. Fast sedimentation leads to crustal cooling, slow sedimentation to crustal heating. The turning-point value is lithology-dependent and corresponds to 2.0 mm/yr for shale, 2.2 mm/yr for clay, and 1.4 mm/yr for sand; a sandstone will cause an increased cooling at both high and low velocities. Our modelling shows that footwall cooling during or immediately after a rifting event cannot be explained by the downwards movement of the adjacent, relatively cold hanging wall. Consequently, in areas where such a cooling is observed, other cooling mechanisms must play an important role. These can be phenomena like footwall uplift or the fading out of an older thermal anomaly.},

abstract = {Thermal history and evolution of the Palaeozoic petroleum system of the western Lower Saxony Basin as well as charge history of the Apeldorn gas field was reconstructed using 2-D forward basin modelling software. The Apeldorn gas field is located on an inverted western rim of the Lower Saxony Basin (LSB) and belongs with its relatively anomalous nitrogen content of 73.9 vol. % to one of the most unique gas accumulations in North Germany. Based on thermal calibration studies utilising both, vitrinite reflectance and corrected bottom hole temperatures as calibration parameters, a shallow burial model and an anomalous event of Coniacian high heat flow of 80 to 120 mW/m2 was derived. As result, Lower Triassic and younger successions became subjected to slight changes in thermal maturity as opposed to Carboniferous and Permian successions, which show no assessable impact of the high heat flow event on the coalification pattern. The deep burial model in contrary to the shallow burial model is not supported by the structural reconstruction and backstripping in this more marginal setting. According to the modelling results, the key charge of the present Apeldorn gas field began in Tithonian (late Upper Jurassic) during the major phase of rifting in the Lower Saxony Basin. The present Westphalian coal-derived gas accumulations of the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein reservoir were sourced directly from modelled methane pools at top Rotliegend level. The hydrocarbon potential of the Westphalian source rocks became exhausted in Oxfordian (early Upper Jurassic). Reduction of the hydrostatic pressure during the Coniacian high heat flow event together with uplift during the Coniacian-Santonian inversion led to an extensive free gas exsolution. The resulting gas mixture between the exsolved free gas and the Westphalian coal-derived gas reached and saturated Buntsandstein reservoir. The structural trap became destroyed in course of the inversion leading to a sharp decrease of methane and nitrogen saturation.},

This calibration results in a more precise older age of 28.201 +/- 0.046 million years ago (Ma) and reduces the 40Ar/39Ar method's absolute uncertainty from approximately 2.5 to 0.25%. In addition, this calibration provides tight constraints for the astronomical tuning of pre-Neogene successions, resulting in a mutually consistent age of approximately 65.95 Ma for the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary.},

abstract = {A set of preferred geotherms for the continental crust is calculated using assumptions of steady state conductive heat transfer. The calculations use observed heat flow as the principal constraint, temperature and pressure dependent thermal conductivity functions, and a radiogenic heat generation profile that is consistent with a generalized petrological model of the lithosphere. Properties of these geotherms include: (1) a nearly constant gradient through the upper crust because the decrease in thermal conductivity at higher temperatures for felsic rocks counteracts the decreasing heat flow caused by crustal radioactivity; (2) divergence of the geotherms amounting to temperature differences of more than 500 K between rifts and shields at Moho depths, and (3) convergence of geotherms below 250 km in the asthenosphere as convective heat transfer dominates. Emphasis is also placed on understanding the sensitivity of calculated temperatures to measureable properties. Computed geotherms are overall most sensitive to surface heat flow or reduced heat flow, and uncertainties in this quantity will ultimately limit the accuracy of temperature estimations for the deeper crust and lithosphere. Otherwise, the sensitivity to parameters such as heat production, thermal conductivity and its temperature dependence throughout the lithosphere and crustal thickness depends on depth and whether the region is characterized by high or low heat flow. Upper mantle heat production, pressure coefficients of thermal conductivity, and the position of the upper/lower crust boundary are relatively insensitive parameters for lower crustal temperature calculations. Dynamic events accompanying crust forming processes lead to significant perturbations of the steady state static temperature field described above. Pressure-temperature pairs from granulite terrains plot near high temperature limits for those steady state geotherms and imply either a transient P-T-t path or a magmatic heat input from the mantle accompanying crustal thickening.},

abstract = {Lithospheric-scale faults related to oblique subduction are responsible for some of the most hazardous earthquakes reported worldwide. The mega-thrust in the Sunda sector of the Sumatran oblique subduction has been intensively studied, especially after the infamous 2004 Mw 9.1 earthquake, but its onshore kinematic complement within the Sumatran subduction, the transform Sumatran Fault System, has received considerably less attention. In this paper, we apply a combination of analysis of Digital Elevation Models (ASTER GDEM) and field evidence to resolve the kinematics of the leading edge of deformation of the northern sector of the Sumatran Fault System. To this end, we mapped the northernmost tip of Sumatra, including the islands to the northwest, between 4.5??N and 6??N. Here, major topographic highs are related to different faults. Using field evidence and our GDEM structural mapping, we can show that in the area where the fault bifurcates into two fault strands, two independent kinematic regimes evolve, both consistent with the large-scale framework of the Sumatran Fault System. Whereas the eastern branch is a classic Riedel system, the western branch features a fold-and-thrust belt. The latter contractional feature accommodated significant amounts (c. 20%) of shortening of the system in the study area. Our field observations of the tip of the NSFS match a strain pattern with a western contractional domain (Pulau Weh thrust splay) and an eastern extensional domain (Pulau Aceh Riedel system), which are together characteristic of the tip of a propagating strike-slip fault, from a mechanical viewpoint. For the first time, we describe the strain partitioning resulting from the propagation of the NSFS in Sumatra mainland. Our study helps understanding complex kinematics of an evolving strike-slip system, and stresses the importance of field studies in addition to remote sensing and geophysical studies.},

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to the ocean supplies Sr with less radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr than seawater, and thus constitutes an important term in the Sr isotope budget of the modern ocean. However, few data exist for Sr in coastal groundwater or in the geochemically dynamic subterranean estuary (STE). We examined Sr concentrations and isotope ratios from nine globally-distributed coastal sites and characterized the behavior of Sr in the STE. Dissolved Sr generally mixed conservatively in the STE, although large differences were observed in the meteoric groundwater end-member Sr concentrations among sites (0.1-24$\mu$M Sr). Strontium isotope exchange was observed in the STE at five of the sites studied, and invariably favored the meteoric groundwater end-member signature. Most of the observed isotope exchange occurred in the salinity range 5-15, and reached up to 40% exchange at salinity 10. Differences in fresh groundwater Sr concentrations and isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr=0.707-0.710) reflected aquifer lithology. The SGD end-member 87Sr/86Sr must be lower than modern seawater (i.e., less than 0.70916) in part because groundwater Sr concentrations are orders of magnitude higher in less-radiogenic carbonate and volcanic island aquifers. A simple lithological model and groundwater Sr data compiled from the literature were used to estimate a global average groundwater end-member of 2.9$\mu$M Sr with 87Sr/86Sr=0.7089. This represents a meteoric-SGD-driven Sr input to the ocean of 0.7-2.8×1010molSry-1. Meteoric SGD therefore accounts for 2-8% of the oceanic Sr isotope budget, comparable to other known source terms, but is insufficient to balance the remainder of the budget. Using reported estimates for brackish SGD, the estimated volume discharge at salinity 10 (7-11×1015Ly-1) was used to evaluate the impact of isotope exchange in the STE on the brackish SGD Sr flux. A moderate estimate of 25% isotope exchange in the STE gives an SGD Sr end-member 87Sr/86Sr of 0.7091. The brackish SGD Sr flux thus accounts for 11-23% of the marine Sr isotope budget, but does not appear sufficient to balance the $\sim$40% remaining after other known sources are included. Substantial uncertainties remain for estimating the SGD source of Sr to the global ocean, especially in the determination of the volume flux of meteoric SGD, and in the paucity of measurements of groundwater Sr isotope composition in major SGD regions such as Papua New Guinea, the South America west coast, and West Africa. Consequently, our global estimate should be viewed with some caution. Nevertheless, we show that the combined sources of meteoric SGD and brackish SGD coupled with isotope exchange in the STE may constitute a substantial component ($\sim$13-30%) of the modern oceanic 87Sr/86Sr budget, likely exceeding less radiogenic Sr inputs by sedimentary diagenesis and hydrothermal circulation through the mid-ocean ridge system. Temporal variation in SGD Sr fluxes and isotope composition may have contributed to fluctuations in the oceanic 87Sr/86Sr ratio over geologic time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mechanisms for kilometre-scale, open-system fluid flow during regional metamorphism remain problematic. Debate also continues over the degree of fluid flow channellization during regional metamorphism, and the mechanisms for pervasive fluid flow at depth. The requirements for pervasive long-distance fluid flow are an interconnected porosity and a large regional gradient in fluid pressure and hydraulic head (thermally or structurally controlled) that dominates over local perturbations in hydraulic head due to deformation. In contrast, dynamic or transient porosity interconnection and fluid flow accompanying deformation of heterogeneous rock suites should result in moderately to strongly channellized flow at a range of scales, of which there are many examples in the literature. Classification of fluid flow types based on scale and degree of equilibration between fluid and rock, wallrock permeability, and mode of fluid transport contributes to an understanding of key factors that control fluid flow. Closed-system fluid behaviour, with restricted fluid flow in microcracks or cracks and limited fluid–rock interaction, occurs over a range of strains and crustal depths, but requires low permeabilities and/or small fluid fluxes. Long-distance, open-system fluid flow in channels is favoured in heterogeneous rocks at high strains, moderate (but variable) permeabilities, and moderate to high fluid fluxes. Long-distance, broad, pervasive fluid flow during regional metamorphism requires that the rocks are not accumulating high strains and have high permeabilities, low permeability contrasts, and high fluid fluxes. The ideal situation for such fluid flow is in situations where the rocks are undergoing stress relaxation immediately after a major deformation phase. In the mid-crust, fairly specific conditions are thus required for pervasive fluid flow. During active orogenesis, structurally controlled fluid flow (with focused open systems surrounding regions of closed-system behaviour) predominates in most, but not all, regional metamorphic situations, at a range of scales.},

abstract = {The magmatic response to extension of the continental lithosphere, with the resultant formation of sedimentary basins, varies widely. Quantitative models (e.g. McKenzie and Bickle, 1988), based upon an assumption of anhydrous partial melting in both lithosphere and asthenosphere, suggest that the temperature of the sub-lithospheric upper mantle, upwelling beneath the zone of extension, exerts a fundamental control on both the chemistry and volume of the erupted magmas. High volcanicity rifts are, in general, only likely to occur when the asthenospheric potential temperature is ca. 100-300[degree sign]C greater than normal, associated with the activity of mantle plumes. In addition, such models also predict a strong correlation between the volume of magma produced and the amount of lithospheric stretching ([beta]). More complex models (e.g. Gallagher and Hawkesworth, 1992) include partial melting of volatile-rich mantle source regions with lower than normal solidus temperatures. These may reside within mantle plumes or within enriched domains within the continental lithospheric mantle. Quantitative modelling of the magma generation process in the latter case is limited by our rather poor understanding of volatile-present partial melting of the range of potential source components. Geochemical and isotopic (Sr–Nd–Pb–O) studies of the igneous rocks emplaced within a basin are of fundamental importance in evaluating the relative roles of lithospheric versus asthenospheric source components in the petrogenesis of the magmas and the depth and degree of partial melting. In addition, these data may provide important constraints on the amount of crustal contamination which has occurred, particularly by partial melting of the lower crust. Knowledge of the latter is important in the development of models to explain crustal thinning. In many basins the bulk of the mantle-derived magmas may never actually reach the surface, but are underplating and intruding the lower crust instead. Identification of such a mafic underplate is critical if the amount of crustal thinning is to be evaluated correctly. The location of eruptive sites within individual basins is frequently determined by pre-existing basement structures. Within the extensive Mesozoic rift system of West and Central Africa, Pan-African lithospheric shear zones and deep basement faults have acted as foci for rift basin development, with the faults acting as magma pathways to the surface. In western and central Europe, Neogene–Recent extension has generated an extremely varied magmatic response which can be correlated with the Hercynian structural grain of the lithosphere. The Rhine graben, trending at a high angle to the Hercynian terrane boundaries is largely amagmatic. In contrast the Ohre rift of Czechoslovakia, which trends parallel to a major (Saxothuringian–Moldanubian) terrane boundary, is a classic example of a pure shear rift with major volcanic complexes located along the axial zone.},

abstract = {Numerical solutions of the equations of fluid flow and heat transport are used to quantify the effects of groundwater flow on the subsurface thermal regime. Simulations are carried out for a vertical section through a basin with a distance of 40 km separating the regional topographic high and low. Emphasis is placed on understanding the conditions under which advective effects significantly perturb the thermal field. The transition from conduction-dominated to advection-dominated thermal regimes is sharp and depends primarily on the topographic configuration of the water table, the magnitude and spatial distribution of permeability, hydraulic anisotropy, and the depth of active flow. Deviations of surface heat flow from the background heat flux are a measurable effect of groundwater flow and depend on the same factors. Our results show that from 0% to almost 100% of the section may have surface heat flow significantly different from background heat flow, depending upon the nature of the hydrogeologic environment. A limited spatial variability in a distributed set of heat flow measurements and/or linear temperature-depth profiles does not ensure that surface heat flow measurements are not disturbed. The results of our simulations suggest that knowledge of the complete environment of a site, including the water table configuration and subsurface flow system, combined with more closely spaced heat flow measurements may be necessary to unravel the true background heat flux in active flow regions.},

At three sites, erosion rates and hillslope gradients are strongly correlated, increasing with proximity to fault scarps and river canyons, which appear to have accelerated local base-level lowering rates, and thus increased catchment erosion rates by up to 15-fold. At four other sites, far from fault scarps and river canyons, erosion rates are much more uniform and less sensitive to average hillslope gradient. Our measurements show that contrasts in landscape erosion rates cannot be inferred from hillslope gradients alone, because landscapes can evolve toward a state of erosional equilibrium, in which steep and gentle slopes erode at similar rates.},

@article{Poulet2012,
abstract = {We present escript-RT, a new reactive transport simulation code for fully saturated porous media which is based on a finite element method (FEM) combined with three other components: (i) a Gibbs minimisation solver for equilibrium modelling of fluid–rock interactions, (ii) an equation of state for pure water to calculate fluid properties and (iii) a thermodynamically consistent material database to determine rocks' material properties. Using decoupling of most of the standard governing equations, this code solves sequentially for temperature, pressure, mass transport and chemical equilibrium. In contrast, pressure and Darcy flow velocities are solved as a coupled system. The reactive transport itself is performed using the masses of chemical elements instead of chemical species. In such way it requires less computing memory and time than the majority of other packages. The code is based on escript, a parallelised platform which supports efficient stepwise simulation of realistic geodynamic scenarios at multiple scales. It is particularly suitable to analyse hydrothermal systems involving geometrically complex geological structures with strong permeability contrasts and subject to complex fluid–rock chemical interactions. The modular architecture of the code and its high level Python interface also provide flexibility for modellers who can easily modify or add new feedbacks between the different physical processes. In addition, the implemented abstract user interface allows geologists to run the code without knowledge of the underlying numerical implementation. As an example we show the simulation of hydrothermal gold precipitation in a granite–greenstone geological sequence, which illustrates the important coupling between thermal response and mass transfer to the localisation of gold.

@article{DeGraciansky1989,
abstract = {The whole of the Western Alpine realm can be considered to result from the inversion of the European margin of Ligurian Tethys as a consequence of the collision between Apulia and Europe. The margin was developed due to Tethyan rifting during the Liassic and Middle Jurassic and regional thermal subsidence as the Ligurian ocean was spreading in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Coevally, the margin underwent additional stretching in response to North Atlantic rifting. Inversion was initiated by Late Cretaceous times when the Ligurian oceanic crust began to be subducted, with localized obduction, beneath the previously passive margin. The most recent inversion of the Western Alps occurred in the external Molasse basin of Manosque-Digne-Valensole during the Late Miocene and Pliocene. Regions of mild inversion allow useful comparisons to be made with more strongly inverted basins. The geometric characteristics of the inverted basins depend on the lithology, geometry of the extensional structures, orientation of extensional faults with respect to the compressive Alpine stresses and the amount of compression. Comparisons of the external and interal zones suggest that the ductilely deformed thrust sheets may have originated from inverted half-grabens.},

@article{Deming2002,
abstract = {Over the last decade, the picture that has emerged from several geologic disciplines is that the Earth's crust is permeable to great depths and that fluids are more or less constantly moving, transporting both heat and mass and affecting virtually every geologic process. In contrast, workers in the petroleum industry have maintained that sections of the crust contain impermeable pressure seals and hydraulically sealed compartments. We show that these starkly different conceptions can be reconciled by a theory of self-sealing through gas generation in sedimentary basins. The model especially applies to older sedimentary basins where overpressuring cannot be readily explained as the result of ongoing sedimentation and compaction disequilibrium. In our conceptual model, overpressuring is created by catagenic gas generation and maintained by a combination of vertical and horizontal gas capillary seals. Data from the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma provide support for the self-sealing hypothesis. Well logs reveal the presence of 9 or 10 gas-water interfaces over a 30-m overpressured interval. Capillary pressure measurements show that the force necessary for gas to displace water from a shale is ∼3 × 106 Pa, a pressure equivalent to that exerted by a column of water 300 m high. A theory of self-sealing explains the anomalous overpressuring observed in some older sedimentary basins by invoking known mechanisms and forces; it is both parsimonious and falsifiable.},

Particle imaging velocimetry provides insight into the deformation history of the experiments and illustrates the localization pattern of fault segments. Results show that with increasing angle between joint-set and basement-fault strike the number of secondary fractures and the number of connected joints increase, while the area fraction of massively dilatant fractures shows only a minor increase. Models without pre-existing joints show far lower area fractions of massively dilatant fractures while forming distinctly more secondary fractures.},

We have used measurements from an eddy correlation system to derive the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer over a bare soil surface as well as over a maize canopy. Diurnal variations of aerodynamic resistance have been analyzed. The results showed that the diurnal variation of aerodynamic resistance during daytime (07:00 h–18:00 h) was significant for both the bare soil surface and the maize canopy although the range of variation was limited. Based on the measurements made by the eddy correlation system, a comprehensive evaluation of eight popularly used parameterization schemes of aerodynamic resistance was carried out. The roughness length for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in the estimation of aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer and can neither be taken as a constant nor be neglected. Comparing with the measurements, the parameterizations by Choudhury et al. (1986), Viney (1991), Yang et al. (2001) and the modified forms of Verma et al. (1976) and Mahrt and Ek (1984) by inclusion of roughness length for heat transfer gave good agreements with the measurements, while the parameterizations by Hatfield et al.

As a part of a larger study addressing these and related questions, we have characterized the microbiology and hydrogeology of a Late Cretaceous sandstone and shale sequence in the southeastern San Juan Basin New Mexico, near a 3.39 Ma volcanic intrusion. Deep core samples were analyzed for microbial activity to assess recolonization of the previously sterilized zone around the intrusion. Groundwater geochemistry and isotopic data were used to improve the understanding of the flow regime. We modeled the geochemical evolution of the groundwater from the recharge area to each sample location and used the resultant mass transfers to correct measured 14C activities. The 14C ages provided the basis for calibrating a cross-sectional flow model that intersects the intrusion. Based on microbial activity data, hydrogeologic modeling results supported the inference that groundwater velocities were adequate to transport microbes into the previously sterilized region in the time since the volcanic intrusion. Evidence of upward groundwater flow near the intrusion and high vertical hydraulic conductivities for shale suggest considerable hydraulic connection between lithologie units, which may influence the nutrient distribution and promote enhanced microbial activity near lithologic interfaces.},

@article{Simms2004,
abstract = {Abstract Thermal convection has the potential to be a significant and widespread mechanism of fluid flow, mass transport, and heat transport in rift and other extensional basins. Based on numerical simulation results, large-scale convection can occur on the scale of the basin thickness, depending on the Rayleigh number for the basin. Our analysis indicates that for syn-rift and early post-rift settings with a basin thickness of 5 km, thermal convection can occur for basal heat flows ranging from 80 to 150 mW m-2, when the vertical hydraulic conductivity is on the order of 1.5 m year-1 and lower. The convection cells have characteristic wavelengths and flow patterns depending on the thermal and hydraulic boundary conditions. Steeply dipping extensional faults can provide pathways for vertical fluid flow across large thicknesses of basin sediments and can modify the dynamics of thermal convection. The presence of faults perturbs the thermal convective flow pattern and can constrain the size and locations of convection cells. Depending on the spacing of the faults and the hydraulic properties of the faults and basin sediments, the convection cells can be spatially organized to align with adjacent faults. A fault-bounded cell occurs when one convection cell is constrained to occupy a fault block so that the up-flow zone converges into one fault zone and the down-flow zone is centred on the adjacent fault. A fault-bounded cell pair occurs when two convection cells occupy a fault block with the up-flow zone located between the faults and the down-flow zones centred on the adjacent faults or with the reverse pattern of flow. Fault-bounded cells and cell pairs can be referred to collectively as fault-bounded convective flow. The flow paths in fault-bounded convective flow can be lengthened significantly with respect to those of convection cells unperturbed by the presence of faults. The cell pattern and sense of circulation depend on the fault spacing, sediment and fault permeabilities, lithologic heterogeneity, and the basal heat flow. The presence of fault zones also extends the range of conditions for which thermal convection can occur to basin settings with Rayleigh numbers below the critical value for large-scale convection to occur in a basin without faults. The widespread potential for the occurrence of thermal convection suggests that it may play a role in controlling geological processes in rift basins including the acquisition and deposition of metals by basin fluids, the distribution of diagenetic processes, the temperature field and heat flow, petroleum generation and migration, and the geochemical evolution of basin fluids. Fault-bounded cells and cell pairs can focus mass and heat transport from longer flow paths into fault zones, and their discharge zones are a particularly favourable setting for the formation of sediment-hosted ore deposits near the sea floor.},

abstract = {We present a new estimate of the Earth's heat loss based on a new global compilation of heat flow measurements comprising 24,774 observations at 20,201 sites. On a 5° × 5° grid, the observations cover 62% of the Earth's surface. Empirical estimators, referenced to geological map units and derived from the observations, enable heat flow to be estimated in areas without measurements. Corrections for the effects of hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust compensate for the advected heat undetected in measurements of the conductive heat flux. The mean heat flows of continents and oceans are 65 and 101 mW m−2, respectively, which when areally weighted yield a global mean of 87 mW m−2 and a global heat loss of 44.2 × 1012 W, an increase of some 4-8% over earlier estimates. More than half of the Earth's heat loss comes from Cenozoic oceanic lithosphere. A spherical harmonic analysis of the global heat flow field reveals strong sectoral components and lesser zonal strength. The spectrum principally reflects the geographic distribution of the ocean ridge system. The rate at which the heat flow spectrum loses strength with increasing harmonic degree is similar to the decline in spectral strength exhibited by the Earth's topography. The spectra of the gravitational and magnetic fields fall off much more steeply, consistent with field sources in the lower mantle and core, respectively. Families of continental and oceanic conductive geotherms indicate the range of temperatures existing in the lithosphere under various surface heat flow conditions. The heat flow field is very well correlated with the seismic shear wave velocity distribution near the top of the upper mantle.},

@article{Clauser1997,
abstract = {An extensive geothermal research program within the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB) covered an almost complete spectrum of experimental and theoretical aspects. The main results and conclusions are as follows: (1) Equilibrium temperature is 118.6 °C at 4000 m in the KTB pilot borehole (KTB-VB) and will be around 260 °C at 9100 m in the KTB main borehole (KTB-HB). Time required for thermal equilibration of the KTB-HB to within 1% of the initial perturbation will be about 13–16 years. (2) The failure to predict temperature correctly for the KTB was mainly due to an unaccounted perturbation by a transient ground surface temperature history. (3) Pleistocene surface temperature variations affect the present-day crustal temperature between 1.3 to 2.7 K up to a depth of 4000 m. Accordingly, present-day heat flow density is systematically too low down to approximately 1500 m. Model simulations indicate that groundwater flow does not eliminate paleoclimatic signals, even though it may translate them to a depth incompatible with both their diffusive age and their amplitude. These results emphasize the importance of an adequate consideration of paleoclimatic effects for the interpretation of thermal data. (4) Lateral heat transport is significant when steep inclination and folding of the rock formations coincide with contrasts in thermal conductivity. This is indicated by typical variations in the vertical components of temperature gradient and heat flow density, such as in the KTB-HB. In contrast, thermally relevant advection of heat is confined to the top 500–1000 m. In the vicinity of the KTB, this is about twice the maximum difference in elevation. (5) In the deeper crust, free convection systems require permeabilities greater than 10−17 m2 for large rock volumes, but simple numerical models indicate that the associated temperature regimes are incompatible with KTB borehole data. (6) Heat production rate shows no systematic variation with depth and is related to lithology at the KTB as in other deep boreholes in crystalline rock. Numerical models, using heat production rate derived from seismic velocities, yield temperatures compatible with KTB borehole data.},

abstract = {Abstract  We studied veins in the Triassic Buntsandstein of the Lower Saxony Basin (NW Germany) with the aim of quantifying the evolution of in-situ stress, fluids and material transport. Different generations of veins are observed. The first generation formed in weakly consolidated rocks without a significant increase in fracture permeability and was filled syntectonically with fibrous calcite and blocky to elongate-blocky quartz. The stable isotopic signature ($\delta$18O and $\delta$13C) indicates that the calcite veins precipitated from connate water at temperatures of 55–122°C. The second vein generation was syntectonically filled with blocky anhydrite, which grew in open fractures. Fluid inclusions indicate that the anhydrite veins precipitated at a minimum temperature of 150°C from hypersaline brines. Based on $\delta$34S measurements, the source of the sulphate was found in the underlying Zechstein evaporites. The macro- and microstructures indicate that all veins were formed during subsidence and that the anhydrite veins were formed under conditions of overpressure, generated by inflation rather than non-equilibrium compaction. The large amount of fluids which are formed by the dehydrating gypsum in the underlying Zechstein and are released into the Buntsandstein during progressive burial form a likely source of overpressures and the anhydrite forming fluids.},

The k was modeled well by the Kozeny-Carman equation for three-component mixtures by using a representative grain size parameter, d, computed by averaging the grain diameters of components recursively, with averaging methods based on whether finer components exist in sufficient volume to fill the pores within coarser components. The phi was modeled well by using linear interpolation with piecewise-planar models. We explored the use of differing numbers of piecewise-planar elements in the model, and illustrate the trade-off between the increased accuracy and the increased data requirements that both come from adding more elements. The k model is a function of both d and phi, but more sensitive to d. The k model gave results consistent with measured values when computed using either measured phi values, or values from any of the phi models.},

abstract = {The role of hydrothermal fluids in assisting the activity of strike-slip faults is investigated using a range of new geological, geophysical, and geochemical data obtained on the Argentat fault, Massif Central, France. This fault zone, 180-km-long and 6 to 8 km-width, has experienced coeval intense channeling of hydrothermal fluids and brittle deformation during a short time span (300-295 Ma). According to seismic data, the fault core is a 4-km-wide, vertical zone of high fracture density that rooted in the middle crust ($\sim$13 km) and that involved fluids in its deeper parts (9-13 km depth). If stress analyses in the fault core and strain analyses in the damage zone both support a left-lateral movement along the fault zone, it is inferred that hydrothermal fluids have strongly influenced fault development, and the resulting fault has influenced fluid flow. Fluid pressure made easier fracturing and faulting in zones of competent rocks units and along rheological boundaries. Repeated cycles of increase of fault-fracture permeability then overpressure of hydrothermal fluids at fault extremity favored strong and fast development of the crustal-scale strike-slip fault. The high permeability obtained along the fault zone permitted a decrease of coupling across the weak fault core. Connections between shallower and lower crustal fluids reservoirs precipitate the decrease of fault activity by quartz precipitation and sulfides deposition. The zones of intense hydrothermal alteration at shallows crustal levels and the zones of fluid overpressure at the base of the upper crust both controlled the final geometry of the crustal-scale fault zone. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To fill the gap, a new analytical model is developed for arbitrary soil thicknesses and varying boundary layer conditions. The soil evaporative efficiency is written [0.5 − 0.5 cos($\pi$$\theta$L/$\theta$max)]P with $\theta$L being the water content in the soil layer of thickness L, $\theta$max being the soil moisture at saturation, and P being a function of L and potential soil evaporation. This formulation predicts soil evaporative efficiency in both energy-driven and moisture-driven conditions, which correspond to P < 0.5 and P > 0.5, respectively. For P = 0.5, an equilibrium state is identified when retention forces in the soil compensate the evaporative demand above the soil surface. The approach is applied to in situ measurements of actual evaporation, potential evaporation, and soil moisture at five dif...},

abstract = {In this paper, simple indicators of the propensity for sea water intrusion (SWI) to occur (referred to as "SWI vulnerability indicators") are devised. The analysis is based on an existing analytical solution for the steady-state position of a sharp fresh water-salt water interface. Interface characteristics, that is, the wedge toe location and sea water volume, are used in quantifying SWI in both confined and unconfined aquifers. Rates-of-change (partial derivatives of the analytical solution) in the wedge toe or sea water volume are used to quantify the aquifer vulnerability to various stress situations, including (1) sea-level rise; (2) change in recharge (e.g., due to climate change); and (3) change in seaward discharge. A selection of coastal aquifer cases is used to apply the SWI vulnerability indicators, and the proposed methodology produces interpretations of SWI vulnerability that are broadly consistent with more comprehensive investigations. Several inferences regarding SWI vulnerability arise from the analysis, including: (1) sea-level rise impacts are more extensive in aquifers with head-controlled rather than flux-controlled inland boundaries, whereas the opposite is true for recharge change impacts; (2) sea-level rise does not induce SWI in constant-discharge confined aquifers; (3) SWI vulnerability varies depending on the causal factor, and therefore vulnerability composites are needed that differentiate vulnerability to such threats as sea-level rise, climate change, and changes in seaward groundwater discharge. We contend that the approach is an improvement over existing methods for characterizing SWI vulnerability, because the method has theoretical underpinnings and yet calculations are simple, although the coastal aquifer conceptualization is highly idealized.},

abstract = {[1] Subduction zones are where sediments, oceanic crust, and mantle lithosphere return to and reequilibrate with Earth's mantle. Subduction zones are interior expressions of Earth's 55,000 km of convergent plate margins and are the geodynamic system that builds island arcs. Excess density of the mantle lithosphere in subduction zones provides most of the power needed to move the plates while inducing convection in the overriding mantle wedge. Asthenospheric mantle sucked toward the trench by the sinking slab interacts with water and incompatible elements rising from the sinking plate, and this interaction causes the mantle to melt. These melts rise vertically through downwelling mantle to erupt at arc volcanoes. Subduction zones are thus interior Earth systems of unparalleled scale and complexity. Subduction zone igneous activity formed most ore deposits and continental crust, and earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate present a growing hazard to society. This overview summarizes our present understanding of subduction zones, using perspectives of the incoming plate, downgoing plate, mantle wedge, and arc-trench complex. Understanding the operation of subduction zones stands as one of the great challenges facing the Earth sciences in the 21st century and will require the efforts of global interdisciplinary teams.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of ramification--the mechanism of branching by which such networks grow--remains elusive. Here we show that streams incised by groundwater seepage branch at a characteristic angle of 2$\pi$/5 = 72°. Our theory represents streams as a collection of paths growing and bifurcating in a diffusing field. Our observations of nearly 5,000 bifurcated streams growing in a 100 km(2) groundwater field on the Florida Panhandle yield a mean bifurcation angle of 71.9° ± 0.8°. This good accord between theory and observation suggests that the network geometry is determined by the external flow field but not, as classical theories imply, by the flow within the streams themselves.},

@article{Morgan1984,
abstract = {Thermally, the lithosphere may be defined as that outer portion of the earth in which heat is transferred primarily by conduction. It generally includes the crust and part of the mantle. The thermal regime of continental lithosphere is determined by many factors including heat flow from the asthenosphere, the vertical and lateral variation of both thermal conductivity and radiogenic heat production, tectonic history, and such superficial processes as climatic history and the shallow hydrothermal regime. From studies of the global heat flow data set, two generalizations regarding continental lithosphere have arisen, namely that: 1) there is a negative correlation between heat flow and tectonic age of continental lithosphere; and 2) the thermal evolution of continental lithosphere is similar to that of ocean basins with the result that the "stable geotherm" is similar in both environments. When continental heat-flow data are studied from a regional rather than a global point of view, considerable doubt arises as to the general applicability of either statement. R. U. M. Rao and his associates have demonstrated that while Precambrian terranes do have demonstrably lower heat flows than, say, Tertiary terranes, the data are not normally distributed and it is not possible to establish a negative correlation between heat flow and age in any rigorous statistical way. The scatter in the relation may be explained in terms of the variations in the duration, intensity and even the sign of continental thermotectonic events in contrast to the simple situation (creation of new oceanic lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges) which prevails in the oceans. The scatter also is partially attributable to the large and laterally variable radiogenic component of heat flow on continents. For a province for which a heat flow-heat production relation has been established, much of the scatter in surface heat flow due to crustal radiogenic heat production versus age is eliminated by determining reduced heat flow (surface heat flow minus radiogenic component) as a function of tectonic age, but much scatter remains, and it is still not possible to establish a heat flux-age relation in a rigorous way. Primarily because of the spatial variability in radiogenic heat production, no single geotherm can be used to characterize the thermal regime of a stable continental terrane. Thus, while some sites on stable continental blocks may have a geotherm fortuitously similar to that for old ocean basins, there is no reason to expect that this will be true generally, and many stable continental terranes will be characterized by geotherms markedly different from the geotherm for old ocean basins.},

The practical importance of permeability - and the potential for large, dynamic changes in permeability - is highlighted by ongoing issues associated with hydraulic fracturing for hydrocarbon production ("fracking"), enhanced geothermal systems, and geologic carbon sequestration. Although there are thousands of research papers on crustal permeability, this is the first book-length treatment. This book bridges the historical dichotomy between the hydrogeologic perspective of permeability as a static material property and the perspective of other Earth scientists who have long recognized permeability as a dynamic parameter that changes in response to tectonism, fluid production, and geochemical reactions.},

abstract = {The Pliocene-Quaternary exhumational and topographic evolution of the European Alps and its potential climatic and tectonic controls remain a subject of controversy. Here, we apply inverse numerical thermal-kinematic modelling to a spatially dense thermochronological dataset (apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He) of both tunnel and surface samples across the Mont Blanc massif in the Western Alps, complemented by new zircon fission-track data, in order to better quantify its Neogene exhumation and relief history. Age-elevation relationships and modelling results show that an episodic exhumation scenario best fits the data. Initiation of exhumation in the Mont Blanc massif at 22���2�Ma with a rate of 0.8���0.15�km/Myr is probably related to NW-directed thrusting during nappe emplacement. Exhumation rates decrease at 6���2�Ma to values of 0.15���0.65�km/Myr, which we interpret to be the result of a general decrease in convergence rates and/or extensive exposure of less erodible crystalline basement rocks from below more easily erodible Mesozoic sediments. Finally, local exhumation rates increase up to 2.0���0.6�km/Myr at 1.7���0.8�Ma. Modelling shows that this recent increase in local exhumation can be explained by valley incision and the associated increase in relief at 0.9���0.8�Ma, leading to erosional unloading, isostatic rebound and additional rock uplift and exhumation. Given the lack of tectonic activity as evidenced by constant thermochronological ages along the tunnel transect, we suggest that the final increase in exhumation and relief in the Mont Blanc massif is the result of climate change, with the initiation of mid-Pleistocene glaciations leading to rapid valley incision and related local exhumation.},

abstract = {This report describes the results of mineralogical and geochemical analysis of a suite of mudstones from the London Clay Formation of southern and south-eastern England. The work was carried out as part of the ongoing ‘Ground Movements: Shrink/Swell' project under the Physical Hazards Programme. The first part of the report gives an introduction to the geology of the London Clay Formation and a summary of previous mineralogical studies of these rocks. A summary of analytical methods employed (X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and surface area determinations) is then provided and the results discussed with reference to their likely effect on the engineering performance of the London Clay Formation. The study has generally confirmed the findings of previous workers with typical non-clay mineral assemblages composed of quartz, feldspar (albite and K-feldspar), carbonates (dolomite, siderite and calcite), ‘mica', pyrite, gypsum and goethite while clay mineral assemblages are generally formed of smectite, illite, kaolinite and chlorite. However, the wide geographic and stratigraphic distribution of the analysed samples has provided important new information which will aid not only interpretation of the engineering behaviour of these rocks but also their diagenetic and geological histories. The engineering properties of the London Clay Formation are heavily influenced by its clay mineralogy and the proportion of clay minerals present. This study has shown that while the composition of the clay mineral assemblages is similar across the London Clay Formation outcrop, the proportion of clay material increases from west to east. The most clay-rich samples are found in the London Basin and particularly around the Thames estuary, central Essex and just west of London in eastern Berkshire/Surrey. These clay-rich samples also contain the most smectite and are therefore likely to undergo the greatest shrink-swell volume changes during wetting and drying and provide the most problems in terms of their engineering behaviour. It would appear most likely that the smectite in the London Clay Formation was contributed by the reworking of ash-rich soils while kaolinite was sourced from tropical weathering of granites to the west. A rare occurrence of a pure interlayered kaolinite/smectite clay assemblage in a sample from Studland Bay, Dorset is likely to have developed due to the acidic, tropical weathering of a volcanic-ash or smectite-rich deposit. The very common presence of pyrite, together with gypsum in the London Clay Formation means that concrete engineering sited in these rocks may require sulphate-resistant compositions to avoid acid attack and thaumasite formation.},

abstract = {The permeability k of a porous medium is a geometrical pore space attribute required for quantifying fluid flows and transport processes for hydrological, civil, agriculture, and petroleum engineering applications. Permeability is often expressed as proportional to a characteristic length squared and inversely proportional to factors accounting for porosity, pore shape, and tortuosity effects. Compaction and diagenesis reduce porosity, mean pore size, and connectivity, resulting in decrease in k. Permeability prediction relies on suitable selection of a characteristic length that may vary from simple hydraulic radius approximation of Kozeny-Carman to more complex critical path analysis to identify flow-limiting pore size. For porous media undergoing significant changes in pore space (e.g., compaction due to anthropogenic activities), the proper choice of a robust characteristic length is particularly challenging. We propose using the air entry pressure, a natural characteristic length that gauges the largest drainable pore size. This choice of a characteristic length is compatible with the Aissen formula that provides robust estimates of k for complex pore shapes. Additionally, the model considers geometrical (tortuosity) factors and links relative changes in porosity to concurrent changes in k. The model was tested against experimental data for sands, sandstones with different cementing agents, and unconsolidated soils. For unconsolidated sands and soils the model provides reasonable predictions of permeability for the entire range of porosities determined in laboratory or field experiments. However, for sandstones, and especially those containing cementing agents such as clay, the model is valid up to a critical porosity where hydraulic connectivity is lost, resulting in drastic reduction in k. The geometrical factor for soils was influenced by silt-to-clay ratio, while for sands, it was correlated with mean grain diameter. The model offers improvement in predicting k and provides a means for incorporating critical pore size and connectivity information in addition to porosity.},

abstract = {The kinematic field of central western Europe is characterized by relatively small movements (around 1-2 mm/year) and diffuse seismicity with earthquakes occurring mostly in the shallow crust (within 15 km), prevalently concentrated along the Alps and the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS). In order to study and constrain the current crustal kinematic field we reconstructed the velocity and the strain field using permanent GPS stations, belonging to different networks (AGNES, EUREF, REGAL, RGP). The 2D strain rate tensor has been calculated using the method of least-squares collocation. Our results show that the area of maximum compression is located along the Alpine chain, where maximum values of 7 +/- 2 nstrain/year are found, while maximum extension is measured between the Armorican Massif and the Massif Central, where values of 4 +/- 2 nstrain/year are reached. The earthquakes with M \textgreater 3.0, have been used to estimate the seismic strain rates, while the style of the seismic deformation was reconstructed from the fault plane solutions (FPS) available from the literature. Relatively high values of seismic strain rates (around 10 nstrain/year) are measured along the Alpine Chain and the ECRIS. Results obtained by geodetic and seismic data are quite in agreement and reflect the different tectonic evolution of the geological features characterizing the area of study. The orientation of the compressional geodetic and seismic strain axes are NW-SE in most of the area of study, on account of the action of plate boundary forces. A rotation of the same axes to N-S direction along the eastern Alps, possibly related to the Adria convergence, is found.},

abstract = {Seasonal (Spring and Summer 2002) concentrations of dissolved (<0.22$\mu$m) trace metals (Ag, Al, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb), inorganic nutrients (NO3, PO4, Si), and DOC were determined in groundwater samples from 5 wells aligned along a 30m shore-normal transect in West Neck Bay, Long Island, NY. Results show that significant, systematic changes in groundwater trace metal and nutrient composition occur along the flowpath from land to sea. While conservative mixing between West Neck Bay water and the groundwaters explains the behavior of Si and DOC, non-conservative inputs for Co and Ni were observed (concentration increases of 10- and 2-fold, respectively) and removal of PO4 and NO3 (decreases to about half) along the transport pathway. Groundwater-associated chemical fluxes from the aquifer to the embayment calculated for constituents not exhibiting conservative behavior can vary by orders of magnitude depending on sampling location and season (e.g. Co, 3.4×102– 8.2×103$\mu$mold−1). Using measured values from different wells as being representative of the true groundwater endmember chemical composition also results in calculation of very different fluxes (e.g., Cu, 6.3×103$\mu$mold−1 (inland, freshwater well) vs. 2.1×105$\mu$mold−1(seaward well, S=17ppt)). This study suggests that seasonal variability and chemical changes occurring within the subterranean estuary must be taken into account when determining the groundwater flux of dissolved trace metals and nutrients to the coastal ocean.},

Many of these assumptions are addressed by defining quantitative and flexible methods for realistic parameterization of fault-related uncertainties, and by defining automated methods for including these effects routinely in full-field flow simulation modelling. The fault effects considered include: the two-phase properties of fault rocks; the spatial distributions of naturally variable or uncertain single-phase fault rock properties and fault throws; and the frequencies and properties of sub-resolution fault system or fault zone complexities, including sub-seismic faults, normal drag and damage zones, paired slip surfaces and fault relay zones. Innovative two-phase or geometrical upscaling approaches implemented in a reservoir simulator preprocessor provide transmissibility solutions incorporating the effect, but represented within the geometrical framework of the full-field flow simulation model. The solutions and flexible workflows are applied and discussed within the context of a sensitivity study carried out on two faulted versions of the same full-field flow simulation model. Significant influence of some of these generally neglected fault-related assumptions and uncertainties is revealed.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The large thickness of Upper Carboniferous strata found in the Netherlands suggests that the area was subject to long-term subsidence. However, the mechanisms responsible for subsidence are not quantified and are poorly known. In the area north of the London Brabant Massif, onshore United Kingdom, subsidence during the Namurian-Westphalian B has been explained by Dinantian rifting, followed by thermal subsidence. In contrast, south and east of the Netherlands, along the southern margin of the Northwest European Carboniferous Basin, flexural subsidence caused the development of a foreland basin. It has been proposed that foreland flexure due to Variscan orogenic loading was also responsible for Late Carboniferous subsidence in the Netherlands. In the first part of this paper, we present a series of modelling results in which the geometry and location of the Variscan foreland basin was calculated on the basis of kinematic reconstructions of the Variscan thrust system. Although several uncertainties exist, it is concluded that most subsidence calculated from well data in the Netherlands cannot be explained by flexural subsidence alone. Therefore, we investigated whether a Dinantian rifting event could adequately explain the observed subsidence by inverse modelling. The results show that if only a Dinantian rifting event is assumed, such as is found in the United Kingdom, a very high palaeowater depth at the end of the Dinantian is required to accommodate the Namurian-Westphalian B sedimentary sequence. To better explain the observed subsidence curves, we propose (1) an additional stretching event during the Namurian and (2) a model incorporating an extra dynamic component, which might well explain the very high wavelength of the observed subsidence compared with the wavelength of the predicted flexural foreland basin.},

abstract = {The Great Basin region in the western United States contains active geothermal systems, large epithermal Au-Ag deposits, and world-class Carlin-type gold deposits. Temperature profiles, fluid inclusion studies, and isotopic evidence suggest that modern and fossil hydrothermal systems associated with gold mineralization share many common features, including the absence of a clear magmatic fluid source, discharge areas restricted to fault zones, and remarkably high temperatures (>200 °C) at shallow depths (200–1500 m). While the plumbing of these systems varies, geochemical and isotopic data collected at the Dixie Valley and Beowawe geothermal systems suggest that fluid circulation along fault zones was relatively deep (>5 km) and comprised of relatively unexchanged Pleistocene meteoric water with small (<2.5‰) shifts from the meteoric water line (MWL). Many fossil ore-forming systems were also dominated by meteoric water, but usually exhibit $\delta$O fluid-rock interactions with larger shifts of 5‰–20‰ from the MWL. Here we present a suite of two-dimensional regional (100 km) and local (40–50 km) scale hydrologic models that we have used to study the plumbing of modern and Tertiary hydrothermal systems of the Great Basin. Geologically and geophysically consistent cross sections were used to generate somewhat idealized hydrogeologic models for these systems that include the most important faults, aquifers, and confining units in their approximate configurations. Multiple constraints were used, including enthalpy, $\delta$O, silica compositions of fluids and/or rocks, groundwater residence times, fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures, and apatite fission track anomalies. Our results suggest that these hydrothermal systems were driven by natural thermal convection along anisotropic, subvertical faults connected in many cases at depth by permeable aquifers within favorable lithostratigraphic horizons. Those with minimal fluid $\delta$O shifts are restricted to high-permeability fault zones and relatively small-scale ($\sim$5 km), single-pass flow systems (e.g., Beowawe). Those with intermediate to large isotopic shifts (e.g., epithermal and Carlin-type Au) had larger-scale ($\sim$15 km) loop convection cells with a greater component of flow through marine sedimentary rocks at lower water/rock ratios and greater endowments of gold. Enthalpy calculations constrain the duration of Carlin-type gold systems to probably <200 k.y. Shallow heat flow gradients and fluid silica concentrations suggest that the duration of the modern Beowawe system is <5 k.y. However, fluid flow at Beowawe during the Quaternary must have been episodic with a net duration of $\sim$200 k.y. to account for the amount of silica in the sinter deposits. In the Carlin trend, fluid circulation extended down into Paleozoic siliciclastic rocks, which afforded more mixing with isotopically enriched higher enthalpy fluids. Computed fission track ages along the Carlin trend included the convective effects, and ranged between 91.6 and 35.3 Ma. Older fission track ages occurred in zones of groundwater recharge, and the younger ages occurred in discharge areas. This is largely consistent with fission track ages reported in recent studies. We found that either an amagmatic system with more permeable faults (10 m) or a magmatic system with less permeable faults (10 m) could account for the published isotopic and thermal data along the Carlin trend systems. Localized high heat flow beneath the Muleshoe fault was needed to match fluid inclusion temperatures at Mule Canyon. However, both magmatic and amagmatic scenarios require the existence of deep, permeable faults to bring hot fluids to the near surface.},

abstract = {One of the outstanding problems of palaeoclimate reconstruction from physico-chemical properties of terrigenous deep-sea sediments stems from the fact that most basin fills are mixtures of sediment populations derived from different sources and transported to the site of deposition by different mechanisms. Conventional approaches to palaeoclimate reconstruction from deep-sea sediments do not distinguish between provenance and dispersal-related variations, and therefore often fail to recognise the true significance of variations in sediment properties. We formulate a set of requirements that each proposed palaeo-environmental indicator should fulfil, and focus on the intrinsic coupling between grain size and chemical composition. A critical review of past achievements in grain-size analysis serves to introduce a conceptual model of spatio-temporal grain-size variation based on dynamic populations. Each dynamic population results from a characteristic combination of production and transport mechanisms that corresponds to a distinct subpopulation in the data analysed. The mathematical–statistical representation of the conceptual model can be obtained by means of the end-member-modelling algorithm EMMA. Applications of the model to several ocean basins are discussed, as well as methods to examine the validity of grain-size-based palaeoclimate reconstructions. Palaeoclimate reconstructions of a high- and low-latitude basin illustrate the common degree of complexity of deep-sea grain-size records.},

Long-term isolation – up to 1 million years – of high-level radioactive waste under varying conditions is essential.A key concern is the hydro-mechanical response of the clay deposits in which radioactive waste might possibly be stored, in particular during glacial climate conditions as has happened repeatedly in the Netherlands during the Pleistocene.To evaluate this possibility hydro-mechanical computer simulations and mechanical laboratory experiments have been performed to analyse the effects of glacial loading by a thousand-metre-thick ice sheet on the permeability characteristics, fluid flow rates and the associated migration of radio-nuclides both within and out of Tertiary clays. Glacial loading causes the expulsion of pore water from deeply buried clay deposits into adjoining aquifers.The rates and duration of the consolidation-driven outflow of water from the clay deposit, are very sensitive to the permeability of the clay and the dynamics of the advancing ice sheet.The maximum outflow rate of pore water is 1 mm per year.This rate is approximately three times faster than the flow rate of water in clay prior to ice loading. These preliminary simulation studies also indicate that cyclic loading can result in more rapid migration of radio-nuclides in clays. In clay deposits that are covered by a thick ice sheet, the contribution of dispersed transport relative to the total transport by diffusion amounts to 14%, assuming that there is no absorption of radio-nuclides by the clays and a longitudinal dispersivity of 50 m.},

@article{Lowell1995,
abstract = {Inversion is dependent on pre-existing basin configuration in the initial subsidence, usually extensional phase, and the resolution of compressional forces in the later shortening phase. External horizontal, rather than isostatic vertical forces are required for inversion because many deep sediment-filled basins around the world have never been inverted, but should have been, if isostatic rebound were the driving mechanism. Inversion can range in scale from basins to sub-basins to selected structures within basins. Typically, rift basins can be later inverted. Mainly by reactivation of older normal faults, inversion selects rift basins where, in pure shear, weakening because of necking or thinning of lithosphere has occurred; and where, in simple shear, mechanical detachment surfaces are available for subsequent movement. Some pre-existing lows or sags can apparently be inverted in the absence of reactivated normal faults, as in the southern Altiplano of Bolivia and offshore Sabah, Borneo. Basins can be inverted by dominantly strike-slip with some convergent component, e.g. offshore northeast Brazil, and by almost direct compression, Atlas Mountains, Morocco. A prime difference is that convergent strike-slip can reactivate relatively high-angle normal faults as reverse faults, whereas these faults tend to lock when subjected to more direct compression which then creates lower angle contractional faults. Usually, inversion is caused by a combination of compression and strike-slip (transpression) because the azimuth of maximum principal compressional stress to the direction of original basin trend vectors into an oblique-slip component. This is illustrated in northern Argentina where compression derived from Andean deformation is resolved obliquely (about 45degrees) against an older rift basin in the foreland nearby. Interestingly, for this area at least, the 45degrees angle which affords an equal contribution of strike slip and compression results only in reactivation of older normal faults and does not create younger contractional features. Apparently compressive forces can be transmitted backward from the lead edge of an underthrusted foreland plate to invert rather remote regions and basins that are carried on that plate; this may be a significant part of the mechanism for basin inversion in northwest Europe and the southern North Sea as that foreland region underthrusted along the Alpine system.},

@article{garver1999exhumation,
abstract = {A relatively new field in provenance analysis is detrital fission-track thermochronology which utilizes grain ages from sediment shed off an orogen to elucidate its exhumational history. Four examples highlight the approach and usefulness of the technique. (1) Fission-track grain age (FTGA) distribution of apatite from modern sediment of the Bergell region of the Italian Alps corresponds to ages obtained from bedrock studies. Two distinct peak-age populations at 14.8 Ma and 19.8 Ma give calculated erosion rates identical to in situ bedrock. (2) Zircon FTGA distribution from the modern Indus River in Pakistan is used to estimate the mean erosion rate for the Indus River drainage basin to be about 560 m Ma−1, but locally it is in excess of 1000 m Ma−1. (3) FTGA distribution of detrital apatite and zircon from the Tofino basin records exhumation of the Coast Mountains in the Canadian Cordillera. Comparison of detrital zircon and apatite FT ages gives exhumation rates of c. 200 m Ma−1 during the interval between c. 34 and 54 Ma, but higher rates (c. 1500 m Ma−1) at c. 56 Ma. (4) FTGA analysis of apatite grain ages from a young basin flanking Fiordland in New Zealand indicates that removal of cover strata was followed by profound exhumation at c. 30 Ma, which corresponds to plate reorganization at this time. Exhumation rates at the onset of exhumation were c. 2000–5000 m Ma−1. These studies outline the technique of detrital FTGA applied to exhumation studies and highlight practical considerations: (1) well-dated, stratigraphically coordinated suites of samples that span the exhumation event provide the best long-term record; (2) strata from the basin perimeter are the most likely to retain unreset detrital ages; (3) the removal of ‘cover rocks' precedes exhumation of deeply buried rocks, which retain a thermal signal of the exhumation event; (4) steady-state exhumation produces peak ages that progressively young with time and have a constant lag time; (5) same-sample comparison of zircon and apatite peak ages is best in sequences with high-uranium apatite grains (>50 ppm), and peak-ages statistics can be improved by counting numerous apatite grains (>100).},

abstract = {Whether or not ruptures nucleate in fluid-overpressured crust ( $\lambda$ v = P f/ $\sigma$ v > 0.4) is important because pore-fluids overpressured above hydrostatic lower fault frictional strength and may also vary through the earthquake cycle, acting as an independent variable affecting fault failure. Containment of fluid overpressure is precarious because pressure-dependent activation of faults and fractures allows drainage from overpressured portions of the crust. Discharge of fluids through activated fault-fracture permeability (fault-valve action) decreases overpressure so that subsequent failure depends on the cycling of both overpressure and frictional strength as well as tectonic stress. Geometric and mechanical considerations suggest that fluid overpressures are more likely to develop and be sustained in compressional/transpressional regimes as opposed to extensional/transtensional tectonic settings. On the basis of geophysical observations and force-balance analyses, subduction interface shear zones appear to be strongly but variably overpressured to near-lithostatic levels ( $\lambda$ v > 0.9) over the full depth range of seismogenic megathrusts. Strong overpressuring at seismogenic depths is also documented in active fold-thrust belts and in areas of ongoing compressional inversion (e.g., northern Honshu) where inherited normal faults are reactivated as steep reverse faults, requiring near-lithostatic overpressures ( $\lambda$ v → 1.0) at depths of rupture initiation. Evidence for overpressuring around strike-slip faults is less clear but tends to be strongest in areas of transpression. In areas of extensional tectonics coincident with particularly high fluid discharge, there is some evidence of overpressuring concentrated towards the base of the seismogenic zone. In general, because of the limited resolution of geophysical techniques, it is easier to make the case for rupture propagation through overpressured crust than to make a definitive case for the direct involvement of overpressured fluids in rupture nucleation, though in some instances the circumstantial evidence is compelling. An unresolved related issue is the heterogeneity of overpressuring. Do the active fault zones themselves serve as fluid conduits that are locally overpressured with respect to the surrounding crust?},

Track fading in tektite glass, zircon, olivine, muscovite, phlogopite, and biotite was studied as a function of temperature, pressure, plastic deformation, and highly ionizing radiation. Temperature was found to be the most important parameter, and track-annealing data are given for each material. Hydrostatic pressures up to 80 kb have practically no effect on annealing curves of zircon and olivine. Track annealing in tektites can be accelerated only upon application of an hydrostatic pressure much larger than would ever be encountered by even a well-buried tektite. Purely hydrostatic pressures do not accelerate track annealing in micas, but shear deformations can shorten, distort, or erase tracks. Large doses of ionizing radiation (other than extremely massive nuclear particles) have no effect on track stability in any of the materials. Tracks formed at 77�K have the same appearance as tracks formed at room temperature or higher.},

Inversion zones in the Alpine foreland are mainly associated with Mesozoic grabens and troughs, and although very important in the geologic picture, the conditions of their formation and evolution and their regional geologic significance are not entirely understood. The internal structure of inversion zones is variable and depends on details in the pre-inversion setting, the inversion-inducing stress field, and the sedimentary fill. However, on a larger scale, most inversion zones share certain principal observational features, which sample the physical structure and the rheologic properties of the lithosphere and thereby provide an opportunity to test hypotheses of lithospheric rheology and dynamics. The quantitative model presented in this paper explains how inversion zones and the associated marginal troughs are related to lithospheric zones of differential shortening and regional isostatic compensation of the induced topography.},

None of the strategies which have been used in fission-track dating meet these conditions for all materials and over the whole range of track densities. It is clear that some fission-track ages can simply be experimental artifacts of the methods used.

abstract = {The ratio R of the densities of etchable fission tracks in a mineral and co-irradiated external detector is shown to depend on the length ratios of the latent (Lf/Lf') and etched fission tracks (Le/Le') in the two media. Calculations of Lf for apatite, titanite zircon and Lf' for muscovite external detectors allow a precise determination of R, and confirm that neglecting R could constitute the most significant source of systematic error in fission-track dating with the external detector method. The ratios of the measured fission-track densities in an external and internal surface of apatite and a muscovite external detector are calculated from R and the track counting efficiencies [eta]q. The fact that the results are consistent with the experiment supports the accuracy of R and of the [eta]q-factors. The external detector ages of a basal and prismatic section of Durango apatite are consistent with its reference age, without the need for a length correction. A critical examination of the uncertainties related to the thermal neutron fluence measurements, fission-decay constant, calculated R-value, independently determined [eta]q-factors and the reference age of the standard, demonstrates that the assumption that a reduction of the confined track length of the spontaneous tracks in Durango apatite necessitates a proportional correction of its apparent fission-track age is the element most in question. Published U/Th-He ages lend support to the conclusion that such a correction is not required. The significance of R and of the ratio Q of the [eta]q-factors for the induced and spontaneous track counts leads us to propose a formalisation of the age equation, in which these are included, as well as a formal length correction L, which is, however, not set equal to the ratio of the confined track lengths of the induced and spontaneous tracks. The accuracy of the thermal neutron fluence and the decay constant leads us to propose a possible deconvolution of the [zeta]-calibration factor. If, for suitable age standards L=1, the proposed deconvoluted calibration factor [zeta]0 is a function of R and Q, which can be determined in ways that are independent of the reference ages of the standards. This can either be interpreted as a multiple calibration or as establishing the fission-track method as an independent dating method.},

abstract = {Mesozoic igneous rocks in New England and adjacent areas can be divided into four prov- inces, on the basis of their ages, distribution, physical aspects, and petrology. These provinces represent intraplate magmatism that is corre- lated with successive stages in the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Coastal New England province includes three alkalic complexes and possibly some olivine dolerite dikes, Late Per- mian to Early Triassic in age, that are located in southern Maine and coastal New Hampshire and that were formed during uplift and early rifting in the Gulf of Maine region. Early Juras- sic dolerite dikes occur in most of New England and are part of the Eastern North America prov- ince that extends along the eastern Appalachians from Alabama to Newfoundland, correlated with maximum rift-basin formation and conti- nental breakup. Plutons of the classic White Mountains Magma Series are mainly Early Ju- rassic syenitoids and granitoids in central and northern New Hampshire. This elongate north- south province may have formed along an an- cient transform or rift fault in the New England basement crust. After a relatively nonmagmatic period during the Late Jurassic, the Early Cre- taceous New England-Quebec province of al- kalic syenite-gabbro plutons and lamprophyre dikes formed in a large area of northern New England and adjacent Quebec. Similar magmas created seamount chains southeast of the New England coast, possibly along an extension of transverse Appalachian fracture zones. The Mesozoic New England igneous intrusions and tectonic activity represent incipient rifting in the continental platform, related to mantle convec- tion and plate motions in the North Atlantic basin.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of 34 new heat flow estimates taken in 2004 from 16 water bores and 18 petroleum exploration wells in the western Otway Basin. The average estimated heat flow measured across the study area is 65.6 ± 9.4 mW/m2, with a range of 42–90 mW/m2. There are three recognisable sectors within the study area where heat flow is slightly elevated relative to the background levels. These sectors can be broadly classified as Mount Schank (73.5 ± 0.5 mW/m2), Mount Burr (71.2 ± 7.6 mW/m2) and Beachport (78.3 ± 10.4 mW/m2). Thermal conductivity values for each unit involved in heat flow estimation were determined from laboratory measurements on representative core using a divided bar apparatus. Borehole thermal conductivity profiles were then developed in this study by assigning a constant value of conductivity to each geological formation. The process of collecting temperature data involved measuring temperature profiles for 16 water bores using a cable, winch and thermistor, and compiling well completion temperature data from 18 petroleum wells. The precision of temperature data was higher in the water bores (continuous logs) than in the petroleum wells (largely bottom-of-hole temperature estimates). Inversion heat flow modelling suggests heterogeneous heat flow at 6000 m depth, with two zones where vertical heat flow might exceed 90 mW/m2, and several zones where vertical heat flow might be as low as 40 mW/m2. Therefore, while slightly higher surface heat flow does coincide with some of the volcanic centres, heterogeneous basement heat production is a more likely explanation, as there are no heat flow anomalies greater than 5–10 mW/m2 associated with the Pleistocene–Recent Newer Volcanics Province. The distribution of heat flow in south-east South Australia is most simply explained by non-volcanic phenomena.},

abstract = {We study the influence of vertical fault block motion on the hydrodynamics of continental rift systems in this paper using finite element analysis. Numerical solutions to governing groundwater flow and heat transport equations within independently moving fault blocks are obtained using triangular elements. Hybrid, four-node "slip elements" developed for this study are employed along fault surfaces; standard three-node elements are used everywhere else. The model is used in a sensitivity study to assess the effects of permeability variations, subsidence/erosion rates, and water table configuration on basin hydrodynamics. Idealized simulations of rifting over a 1.5 m.y. period were constructed using two (horst and graben) fault blocks that are vertically offset by 4.5 km during the simulation period. Numerical results indicate that significant interaction between different fluid flow-impelling mechanisms (compaction-, topography-, and density-driven flow) occurs over a permeability range of 10 - 16.5 to 10 - 14.5 m2. Many of the flow fields, especially those in high-permeability (10 - 14.5 m2) horst and graben blocks, produce areas of high and low heat flow relative to conductive conditions. Models which incorporate alternating layers of permeable and less permeable layers indicate that the truncation/reconnection of aquifers can induce transient thermal and hydrologic behavior. The sensitivity results suggest a plausible mechanism for transient fluid flow on geologic timescales (105 to 107 years) within faulted basins and may help to explain the occurrence of some banded ore deposits or multiple episodes of sediment diagenesis preserved within the sedimentary rock record.},

abstract = {At shallow depths in sedimentary basins there are soft clays and loose silts and sands, while diagenetic processes have transformed these sediments to clay- stones, shales, silt- and sandstones at greater depths. Sedimentary rocks continuously undergo physical and chemical changes as a function of burial depth, tem- perature and time, and important hydro-mechanical parameters change during burial, erosion and uplift. An understanding of these processes is important in order to predict the magnitude and distribution of sediment properties and stresses in the basin. The in-situ stress condition affects the rock response to changes in the stress field due to drilling and petroleum production. Soil and rock mechanics (geomechanics) have mainly been developed to solve engineering problems in relation to landslides and surface and underground construction. These are usually at very shallow depths compared to that of a petroleum reservoir. We will here focus on some aspects of geomechanics of particular relevance for the petroleum geologist. Porosity loss (volumetric compaction) with time due to increased effective stress is referred to in the engineering literature as consolidation, while com- paction at constant effective stress is usually called sec- ondary compression or creep. Compaction in deep sed- imentary basins has occurred over geologic time scales at very low strain rates, and at higher temperatures than shallow sediment compaction. Therefore, in addition to mechanical compaction, there are important effects of mineral grain dissolution, precipitation and cemen- tation. This process is called chemical compaction. Compaction determines the porosity, density and per- meability of the sediments which are essential input for basin modelling; petroleum reservoir quality depen- dent on the porosity and permeability. The processes of mechanical and chemical sediment compaction (diage- netic processes) determine the physical properties and are also important for understanding seismic velocity records and seismic attributes in sedimentary basins.},

abstract = {We investigated submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-associated nutrient fluxes and budgets in two coastal embayments, Hwasun Bay and Bangdu Bay, off the volcanic island of Jeju, Korea. SGD in Hwasun Bay is a composite of marine and meteoric groundwater, while that in Bangdu Bay mainly includes marine groundwater. The submarine inputs of groundwater into Hwasun and Bangdu Bays were approximately 0.12 and 0.27 m3 m-2 d-1, respectively, on the basis of the 222Rn mass balance models. The nitrogen : phosphorus ratios in coastal groundwater (85 ± 96) were considerably larger than those in the seawater (3.8 ± 1.6) of both bays. Fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) through SGD were more than 90% of the net DIN input into both bays; approximately 93% and 39% of SGD-driven DIN was consumed inside Hwasun and Bangdu Bays, respectively. The discharge of DIN through SGD from the entire island was approximately 2.1 × 109 mol yr-1, which is equivalent to that of some large rivers, potentially supporting approximately 1.6 × 1011 g carbon yr-1 of new primary production. Because Jeju accounts for less than 1% of the total land mass of the volcanic islands, SGD-driven nutrient fluxes from highly permeable islands standing in oligotrophic oceans could be very important for global nutrient budgets. {\textcopyright} 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract This article reports the results of a study of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters of Majorca (NW Mediterranean). The overall aim is to evaluate the relevance of SGD of the island and chemically characterize the components that are supplied to the coastal waters through this pathway. Although other discharge areas are identified, we particularly focus on SGD in bays and areas of increased sea water residence time where effects of the discharges are expected to be most notable. Analysis at four selected embayments with different land-use characteristics indicated a link between human activities (mainly agriculture and urban) and compounds arriving to the coast. A pathway for these elements is the diffuse discharge along the shoreline, as suggested by the inverse relationship between salinity and nutrients in nearshore porewaters. A general survey was conducted at 46 sites around the island, and used dissolved radium as a qualitative indicator of SGD. Measurements of nutrients (P and N), pCO2 and TOC were performed to characterize the elements delivered to the coastal environment. Most nearshore samples showed 224Ra enrichment (mean SE, 7.0 0.6 dpm 100 l1) with respect to offshore waters (1.1 0.2 dpm 100 l1); however, 224Ra measurements along the coast were highly variable (1.038.1 dpm 100 l1). Coastal samples with enhanced radium levels showed elevated pCO2 with respect to atmospheric concentrations, which together with high pCO2 in groundwater (>5,000 ppm) indicates that SGD is an important vector of CO2 to coastal waters. Moreover, a relationship between 224Ra and phytoplankton biomass was established, suggesting an important impact of SGD on coastal productivity. The results presented here provide a first approximation of the SGD effect in the coastal waters of Majorca, and indicate that SGD could be an important source of nutrients and CO2 to the coast, strongly influencing the productivity and biogeochemical cycling of the coastal waters of Majorca.},

abstract = {Faults may be barriers or conduits for fluid flow in sedimentary basins. The properties of faults, however, depend on stress conditions and rock properties at the time of deformation and subsequent diagenesis of the fault zone. Several recent publications have suggested that petroleum reservoirs in the North Sea and at Haltenbanken, offshore mid-Norway, have experienced leakage along faults caused by imposed stresses, related to glacial loading during the Quaternary. The Jurassic reservoirs in these areas are, however, bounded by faults produced during the Upper Jurassic rifting, when the sediments were still soft and, for the most part, uncemented. These faults do not represent zones of weakness. Because of strain hardening and later diagenesis in sandstones and cementation in mudstones, the fault zones are commonly stronger than the adjacent rocks. They are therefore not likely to be reactivated tectonically. Furthermore, there is little evidence of glacial deformation in the Quaternary sediments overlying these oil fields. It has been proposed that very large horizontal stresses, inferred to be related to periods of glacial loading, caused shear failure at pore pressures below fracture pressure and subsequent leakage along these shear zones. We argue that this is not a likely mechanism during progressive burial in sedimentary basins. Very high horizontal effective stresses, up to 60 MPa, at about 3 km (1.8 mi) depth, at Haltenbanken would have caused more mechanical compaction and grain crushing than that observed in situ. External stress, i.e., plate-tectonic stress from spreading ridges (ridge push), will be transmitted primarily through the basement and not through the much more compressible overlying sedimentary rocks. During progressive basin subsidence, chemical compaction, i.e., caused by quartz cementation, causes rock shrinkage, which will relax differential stresses. This makes brittle deformation (shear failure), resulting in open fractures less likely to occur at stresses below the fracture pressure. In subsiding sedimentary basins with progressive compaction, horizontal stress will normally not exceed the vertical stress except when there is significant shortening of the underlying basement.},

abstract = {Diagenesis and fracture are often linked processes in deformed rock. Empirical observations show that quartz-lined natural fractures are very common in sandstones that have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 90degreesC. These fractures exhibit crack-seal textures as well as cement bridges propping the fractures open and preserving fracture porosity. These diagenetic effects are examined in the context of detailed fracture characterizations generated by geomechanical modelling. Aperture, length and fracture network geometry are examined in the context of subcritical crack growth and various biaxial loading boundary conditions of varying initial anisotropy. An isotropic initial state results in more polygonal fracture patterns. A small initial anisotropy creates preferential through-going fractures that are later connected by cross-fractures. A larger initial anisotropy results in only one parallel set. The flow connectivity of isotropic and small strain anisotropic patterns appears high based on trace pattern geometry, but when the effects of diagenesis are added, preferentially filling smaller aperture fracture segments, connectivity can be significantly reduced. Finite difference, steady-state flow simulations demonstrate the permeability effects of heterogeneous fracture aperture distributions predicted by the mechanical model and permeability reduction caused by systematic diagenetic fracture sealing.},

On a detailed scale, these uncertainties include variations in lateral continuity of faults, properties and thickness of fault zones, and the influence of deformation bands within and outside damage zones. Subseismic features such as small-scale relay zones, drag features and frequency and distribution of small faults around the fault zone further decrease the confidence level of simulation modelling results. Detailed analyses of seismic and well data from the Gullfaks Field, Northern North Sea, have helped understand the detailed structural reservoir characteristics. The results from these analyses can, in many cases, be used as input to further enhance models for reservoir simulation in order to increase the validation of the models. Furthermore, the studies carried out on the Gullfaks Field demonstrate that a sound approach to knowledge management for increased oil recovery based on fault seal analysis requires sharing of gained knowledge from many oil and gas fields rather than monopolizing information that cannot be fully utilized by studies from a single field.},

abstract = {Global synthesis of the findings from ¾140 recharge study areas in semiarid and arid regions provides important information on recharge rates, controls, and processes, which are critical for sustainable water development. Water resource evaluation, dryland salinity assessment (Australia), and radioactive waste disposal (US) are among the primary goals of many of these recharge studies. The chloride mass balance (CMB) technique is widely used to estimate recharge. Average recharge rates estimated over large areas (40–374 000 km2) range from 0Ð2to35 mm year?1, representing 0Ð1–5% of long-term average annual precipitation. Extreme local variability in recharge, with rates up to ¾720 m year?1, results from focussed recharge beneath ephemeral streams and lakes and preferential flow mostly in fractured systems. System response to climate variability and land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes is archived in unsaturated zone tracer profiles and in groundwater level fluctuations. Inter-annual climate variability related to El Ni˜ no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) results in up to three times higher recharge in regions within the SW US during periods of frequent El Ni˜ nos (1977–1998) relative to periods dominated by La Ni˜ nas (1941–1957). Enhanced recharge related to ENSO is also documented in Argentina. Climate variability at decadal to century scales recorded in chloride profiles in Africa results in recharge rates of 30 mm year?1 during the Sahel drought (1970–1986) to 150 mm year?1 during non-drought periods. Variations in climate at millennial scales in the SWUS changed systems from recharge during the Pleistocene glacial period (½10 000 years ago) to discharge during the Holocene semiarid period. LU/LC changes such as deforestation in Australia increased recharge up to about 2 orders of magnitude. Changes from natural grassland and shrublands to dryland (rain-fed) agriculture altered systems from discharge (evapotranspiration, ET) to recharge in the SW US. The impact of LU change was much greater than climate variability in Niger (Africa), where replacement of savanna by crops increased recharge by about an order of magnitude even during severe droughts. Sensitivity of recharge to LU/LC changes suggests that recharge may be controlled through management of LU. In irrigated areas, recharge varies from 10 to 485 mm year?1, representing 1–25% of irrigation plus precipitation. However, irrigation pumpage in groundwater-fed irrigated areas greatly exceeds recharge rates, resulting in groundwater mining. Increased recharge related to cultivation has mobilized salts that accumulated in the unsaturated zone over millennia, resulting in widespread groundwater and surface water contamination, particularly in Australia. The synthesis of recharge rates provided in this study contains valuable information for developing sustainable groundwater resource programmes within the context of climate variability and LU/LC change.

abstract = {The Lower Saxony Basin (LSB) is situated at the southern rim of the Northern Permian Basin, the most important hydrocarbon-bearing province in Europe. In its southern part, areas of high thermal maturation (up to 6% Rr) occur which were previously explained as being caused by magmatic intrusions of Turonian to Santonian age that affected Carboniferous to Lower Cretaceous rocks. In this area, 2D numerical basin modelling was carried out in order to reconstruct the temperature histories along two parallel, N-S-trending seismic sections. Along these sections, new data about maturity distribution and temperature history were obtained by vitrinite reflectance measurements and apatite fission track analysis. For the areas with highest maturity values, low coalification gradients were established which agree well with earlier published data on wells further towards the west. This new information does not support previous hypotheses on high heat flows from magmatic intrusions, even if lateral heat transport is taken into account. Instead, comparisons with a recently published map of the subsurface structure of the LSB indicate that maturity distribution may be closely related to major tectonic structures. Deep burial of individual structures of the LSB, which are bordered by deep E-W- to ESE-WNW-trending faults is further suggested by (a) rapidly increasing thicknesses of preserved Cretaceous strata towards the south and (b) structural restoration of one of the seismic sections. To achieve a fit between measured and calculated palaeo-temperature and vitrinite reflectance data, deep burial of Carboniferous source rocks during Cretaceous time has to be assumed. Due to an inversion phase in the early and middle Upper Cretaceous, major amounts of sediment were removed and further uplift occurred in Tertiary times. In contrast, the northern part of the LSB experienced maximum burial and temperatures during Tertiary times.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track length data are used extensively for thermal history inversion. However, several studies have documented instances of poor reproducibility of length data. We address this problem by using c-axis projection to normalize track lengths for crystallographic angle in the extensive laboratory annealing data set acquired by Barbarand et al. (2003a, 2003b). A new simplification reduces the c-axis projection model from six to four fitted parameters. Normalizing for track angle using c-axis projection improves every aspect of length measurement reproducibility examined. It accelerates convergence of mean length in single analyses; increases consistency among replicate measurements by a single analyst; enhances consistency of measurements of the same mounts by different analysts; and improves the match between analyses conducted with and without Cf-irradiation. C-axis projection is also shown to enhance the thermal sensitivity of length data. Based on these results, we assert that c-axis projection is a good means of compensating for observer bias, although it does not overcome differences caused by experimental error.},

abstract = {The permeability structure of a fault zone in granitic rocks has been investigated by laboratory testing of intact core samples from the unfaulted protolith and the two principal fault zone components; the fault core and the damaged zone. The results of two test series performed on rocks obtained from outcrop are reported. First, tests performed at low confining pressure on 2.54-cm-diameter cores indicate how permeability might vary within different components of a fault zone. Second, tests conducted on 5.1-cm-diameter cores at a range of confining pressures (from 2 to 50 MPa) indicate how variations in overburden or pore fluid pressures might influence the permeability structure of faults. Tests performed at low confining pressure indicate that the highest permeabilities are found in the damaged zone (10-16-10-14 m2), lowest permeabilities are in the fault core (\textless 10-20-10-17 m2), with intermediate permeabilities found in the protolith (10-17-10-16 m2). A similar relationship between permeability and fault zone structure is obtained at progressively greater confining pressure. Although the permeability of each sample decays with increasing confining pressure, the protolith sustains a much greater decline in permeability for a given change in confining pressure than the damaged zone or fault core. This result supports the inference that protolith samples have short, poorly connected fractures that close more easily than the greater number of more throughgoing fractures found in the damaged zone and fault core. The results of these experiments show that, at the coreplug scale, the damaged zone is a region of higher permeability between the fault core and protolith. These results are consistent with previous field-based and in-situ investigations of fluid flow in faults formed in crystalline rocks. We suggest that, where present, the two-part damaged zone-fault core structure can lead to a bulk anisotropy in fault zone permeability. Thus, fault zones with well-developed damaged zones can lead to enhanced fluid flow through a relatively thin tabular region parallel to the fault plane, whereas the fault core restricts fluid flow across the fault. Although this study examined rocks collected from outcrop, correlation with insitu flow tests indicates that our results provide inexact, but useful, insights into the hydromechanical character of faults found in the shallow crust.},

@article{Shuster2009,
abstract = {Recent work [Shuster D. L., Flowers R. M. and Farley K. A. (2006) The influence of natural radiation damage on helium diffusion kinetics in apatite. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 249(3-4), 148-161] revealing a correlation between radiogenic 4He concentration and He diffusivity in natural apatites suggests that helium migration is retarded by radiation-induced damage to the crystal structure. If so, the He diffusion kinetics of an apatite is an evolving function of time and the effective uranium concentration in a cooling sample, a fact which must be considered when interpreting apatite (U-Th)/He ages. Here we report the results of experiments designed to investigate and quantify this phenomenon by determining He diffusivities in apatites after systematically adding or removing radiation damage. Radiation damage was added to a suite of synthetic and natural apatites by exposure to between 1 and 100 h of neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor. The samples were then irradiated with a 220 MeV proton beam and the resulting spallogenic 3He used as a diffusant in step-heating diffusion experiments. In every sample, irradiation increased the activation energy (Ea) and the frequency factor (Do/a2) of diffusion and yielded a higher He closure temperature (Tc) than the starting material. For example, 100 h in the reactor caused the He closure temperature to increase by as much as 36 ??C. For a given neutron fluence the magnitude of increase in closure temperature scales negatively with the initial closure temperature. This is consistent with a logarithmic response in which the neutron damage is additive to the initial damage present. In detail, the irradiations introduce correlated increases in Ea and ln(Do/a2) that lie on the same array as found in natural apatites. This strongly suggests that neutron-induced damage mimics the damage produced by U and Th decay in natural apatites. To investigate the potential consequences of annealing of radiation damage, samples of Durango apatite were heated in vacuum to temperatures up to 550 ??C for between 1 and 350 h. After this treatment the samples were step-heated using the remaining natural 4He as the diffusant. At temperatures above 290 ??C a systematic change in Tc was observed, with values becoming lower with increasing temperature and time. For example, reduction of Tc from the starting value of 71 to ???52 ??C occurred in 1 h at 375 ??C or 10 h at 330 ??C. The observed variations in Tc are strongly correlated with the fission track length reduction predicted from the initial holding time and temperature. Furthermore, like the neutron irradiated apatites, these samples plot on the same Ea - ln(Do/a2) array as natural samples, suggesting that damage annealing is simply undoing the consequences of damage accumulation in terms of He diffusivity. Taken together these data provide unequivocal evidence that at these levels, radiation damage acts to retard He diffusion in apatite, and that thermal annealing reverses the process. The data provide support for the previously described radiation damage trapping kinetic model of Shuster et al. (2006) and can be used to define a model which fully accommodates damage production and annealing. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

While the global magnitude of gauged riverine water discharge is well known, the magnitude of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is poorly constrained. Using an inverse model combined with a global compilation of 228Ra observations, we show that the SGD integrated over the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans between 60°S and 70°N is (12±3)×1013m3 yr?1, which is 3 to 4 times greater than the freshwater fluxes into the oceans by rivers. Unlike the rivers, where more than half of the total flux is discharged into the Atlantic, about 70% of SGD flows into the Indo-Pacific Oceans. We suggest that SGD is the dominant pathway for dissolved terrestrial materials to the global ocean, and this necessitates revisions for the budgets of chemical elements including carbon. 1.},

abstract = {The decrease in permeability (k) of the continental crust with depth (z), as constrained by geothermal data and calculated fluid flux during metamorphism, is given by log k equals -14 - 3.2 log z, where k is in meters squared and z is in kilometers. At moderate to great crustal depths (\textgreater 5 km), this curve is defined mainly by data from prograde metamorphic systems, and is thus applicable to orogenic belts where the crust is being thickened andsolor heated; lower permeabilities may occur in stable cratonic regions. This k-z relation implies that typical metamorphic fluid flux values of 10-11 msols are consistent with fluid pressures significantly above hydrostatic values. The k-z curve also predicts that metamorphic CO2 flux from large orogens may be sufficient to cause significant climatic effects, if retrograde carbonation reactions are minimal, and suggests a significant capacity for diffuse degassing of Earth (1015-1016 gsolyr) in tectonically active regions.},

abstract = {Abstract Detailed information on the hydrogeologic and hydraulic properties of the deeper parts of the upper continental crust is scarce. The pilot hole of the deep research drillhole (KTB) in crystalline basement of central Germany provided access to the crust for an exceptional pumping experiment of 1-year duration. The hydraulic properties of fractured crystalline rocks at 4 km depth were derived from the well test and a total of 23100 m3 of saline fluid was pumped from the crustal reservoir. The experiment shows that the water-saturated fracture pore space of the brittle upper crust is highly connected, hence, the continental upper crust is an aquifer. The pressure-time data from the well tests showed three distinct flow periods: the first period relates to wellbore storage and skin effects, the second flow period shows the typical characteristics of the homogeneous isotropic basement rock aquifer and the third flow period relates to the influence of a distant hydraulic border, probably an effect of the Franconian lineament, a steep dipping major thrust fault known from surface geology. The data analysis provided a transmissivity of the pumped aquifer T = 6.1 x 10-6 m2 sec-1, the corresponding hydraulic conductivity (permeability) is K = 4.07 x 10-8 m sec-1 and the computed storage coefficient (storativity) of the aquifer of about S = 5 x 10-6. This unexpected high permeability of the continental upper crust is well within the conditions of possible advective flow. The average flow porosity of the fractured basement aquifer is 0.6-0.7% and this range can be taken as a representative and characteristic values for the continental upper crust in general. The chemical composition of the pumped fluid was nearly constant during the 1-year test. The total of dissolved solids amounts to 62 g l-1 and comprise mainly a mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl; all other dissolved components amount to about 2 g l-1. The cation proportions of the fluid (XCa approximately 0.6) reflects the mineralogical composition of the reservoir rock and the high salinity results from desiccation (H2O-loss) due to the formation of abundant hydrate minerals during water-rock interaction. The constant fluid composition suggests that the fluid has been pumped from a rather homogeneous reservoir lithology dominated by metagabbros and amphibolites containing abundant Ca-rich plagioclase.},

abstract = {We employ a kinematic model of continental extension to assess the lithospheric structure across the Baikal rift zone. The model includes simple shear extension of the upper crust along detachment faults and independent pure-shear thinning of the lower crust and mantle. Model predictions of topography, gravity anomalies and surface heat flow are compared with observations along two sections, one crossing the central Baikal rift and the other across northern Baikal. For the central Baikal profile, topography and gravity anomaly patterns are fit by a uniform extension model: upper crustal extension of approximately 19 km is equalled by a predicted mantle thinning factor [delta] \textless 2. In contrast, the high flank topography and strongly negative gravity anomalies across the northern Baikal basin require the approximately 12 km of crustal extension there to be accompanied by much higher mantle thinning factors ([delta] = 4-6). A model of non-uniform mantle thinning below northern Baikal is supported by P-T estimates for Miocene and Quaternary lherzolite xenoliths from the Vitim volcanic field. The rate of extension has a minor influence on the predicted topography and gravity anomaly patterns. None of the models predicts a significant (\textgreater 10 mW m-2) increase in regional surface heat flow. The short-wavelength, large-amplitude variability of the observed surface heat flow requires crustal redistribution processes involving large-scale ground water flow. The modelled topography and gravity anomaly patterns suggest that a possible asthenospheric upwarp is more likely to be situated below the northern than below the central Baikal basin, in contrast with earlier inferences from teleseismic and gravity studies.},

Permeabilities between 10−23 and 10−17 m2 have been obtained at porosities between 0.1 and 0.4 in both laboratory and regional studies. Although it is clear that transmissive fractures or other heterogeneities control the large-scale hydraulic behavior of certain argillaceous units, the permeability of many others is apparently scale independent.

@incollection{Sibson19810101,
abstract = {Summary Direct evidence that channel flow of aqueous fluids accompanies shallow crustal faulting, in some instances at least, comes from the observation of transitory surface effusions following some moderate to large earthquakes in consolidated rocks, and the textural characteristics of the hydrothermal vein systems often found associated with ancient, exhumed faults. These phenomena are examined in relation to two alternative models. In the first, the transitory post-seismic flow results from the collapse of pre-failure dilatant fractures in accordance with the dilatancy/fluid-diffusion hypothesis, so that the fault system can be regarded as a ?pump'. In the second model, the fault/fracture system functions as a ?valve' on a fluid reservoir. Rising fluid pressure induces fault slip, creating a temporary fracture permeability which allows partial draining of the reservoir. As the fluid pressure drops, self-sealing of the fracture system occurs by deposition of hydrothermal minerals, and the whole cycle can then be repeated. In some instances there is convincing evidence that extensive fracture dilatancy has developed close in to faults (usually of normal dip-slip character), and that dilatancy pumping has occurred as a result of post-slip collapse of these fracture systems. Dilatant extension fractures can only form or re-open by hydraulic fracturing adjacent to faults provided they retain some cohesive strength, but an important upper limit is thereby placed on the permissible level of differential stress. The more frequent and intense development of extension vein arrays adjacent to normal faults in comparison with thrusts is in accord with theory, which suggests that hydraulic fracturing should occur at significantly lower fluid pressures around the former than the latter.},

abstract = {The strength and permeability of fault zones must be quantified in order to accurately predict crustal strength and subsurface fluid migration. To this end, we performed experiments on mixtures of fine-grained quartz and kaolinite incremented at 10 wt% intervals between the two end-member components (analogues for natural fault gouge) in order to establish their strength and fluid flow properties during hydrostatic and shear loading. Hydrostatically compacted samples exhibited permeability reduction on increasing effective pressures from 5 MPa to 50 MPa, with the rate of reduction displaying strong dependency on the synthetic fault gouge composition. The permeability decreases continuously with increasing kaolinite content. Porosity exhibits a distinct minimum that evolves with increasing effective pressure according to the relative compaction of the quartz and kaolinite end-members. Porosity evolution with increasing clay content is predicted satisfactorily by a simple ideal packing model. At the highest effective pressure (50 MPa), permeability reduced log-linearly over 4 orders of magnitude with increasing clay content. Mechanically, sheared gouge samples showed a continuous reduction in frictional strength with increasing clay fraction. Permeability decreased further on shear loading after initial hydrostatic compaction to 50 MPa. This was most evident for the pure quartz end-member, with two orders of magnitude additional reduction, whereas the clay-rich samples were reduced only tenfold, mostly before a shear strain of 5. Variation of permeability with both clay content and shear deformation may be adequately described by previously published empirical predictors for fault zone permeability. Clay content has the largest effect on permeability, and shear deformation affects permeability of quartz-rich gouges more than clay-rich gouges.},

abstract = {We present two-dimensional numerical models that simulate fluid flow\nin an orogenic overthrust setting in the absence of magmatism. The\nmodeling is intended to test hypotheses regarding the direction of\nregional fluid flow in the middle and deep crust, including upward,\nconvective, sub-horizontal, up-temperature, and down-temperature\nflow regimes. Several geological factors that have received relatively\nlittle attention in previous numerical models of regional metamorphic\nfluid flow are considered: (1) retrograde hydration metamorphic reactions;\n(2) anisotropy and spatial heterogeneity in crustal permeability\nstructure; (3) temporal evolution of permeability as a result of\nporosity production and consumption during metamorphic reactions;\n(4) heat of metamorphic reactions. Our results suggest that the typical\nfluid flow pattern in overthrust settings is towards the surface,\nin the direction of decreasing temperature. The flow is mainly driven\nby metamorphic dehydration reactions; the integrated fluxes in the\ndeep crust below 20 km are of the order of 10(3) m(3)/m(2) over 30\nMyr for a background permeability of 10(-19) m(2). At higher crustal\npermeability, the buoyancy flux generally exceeds the metamorphic\nflux and large-scale fluid circulation becomes possible. Transient\nupward flow in the up-temperature direction is observed during the\nfirst 1-3 Myr of the model evolution within the thrust core that\nundergoes retrograde hydration; this flow is the result of the initially\ninverted geotherm in the thickened crustal section. Downward fluid\ninfiltration caused by metamorphic hydration may occur in the flanks\nof the model orogen, but the integrated fluxes in these areas are\nonly similar to 10 m(3)/m(2). Hydration-driven downward flow may\nalso develop in the core of the orogen at late stages of exhumation.\nLow-permeability layers lead to sub-horizontal (but down-temperature)\nflow over distances corresponding to the lateral dimensions of such\nlayers. Heterogeneities in permeability structure, as well as porosity-permeability\nvariations produced by metamorphic reactions, result in focusing\nof fluid flow and locally elevated fluid fluxes (up to 10(4) m(3)/m(2)).\nThese fluxes are large enough to produce significant chemical and\nisotopic metasomatism, but are not sufficient to significantly affect\nthe temperature distribution in the model orogen. However, metamorphic\nhydration and dehydration reactions are found to exert considerable\ncontrol on the regional thermal structure. We conclude that convective,\ndownward, or up-temperature fluid flow is probably very limited during\namagmatic prograde metamorphism of the middle and lower crust, even\nin the presence of permeability anisotropy, high-permeability channels,\nor low-permeability barriers.},

abstract = {The slip behavior of major faults depends largely on the frictional and hydrologic properties of fault gouge. We report on laboratory experiments designed to measure the strength, friction constitutive properties, and permeability of a suite of saturated clay-rich fault gouges, including: a 50:50% mixture of montmorillonite-quartz, powdered illite shale, and powdered chlorite schist. Friction measurements indicate that clay-rich gouges are consistently weak, with steady state coefficient of sliding friction of \textless0.35. The montmorillonite gouge ($\mu$ = 0.19–0.23) is consistently weaker than the illite and chlorite gouges ($\mu$ = 0.27–0.32). At effective normal stresses from 12 to 59 MPa, all gouges show velocity-strengthening frictional behavior in the sliding velocity range 0.5–300 $\mu$m/s. We suggest that the velocity-strengthening behavior we observe is related to saturation of real contact area, as documented by the friction parameter b, and is an inherent characteristic of noncohesive, unlithified clay-rich gouge. Permeability normal to the gouge layer measured before, during, and after shear ranges from 8.3 × 10−21 m2 to 3.6 × 10−16 m2; permeability decreases dramatically with shearing, and to a lesser extent with increasing effective normal stress. The chlorite gouge is consistently more permeable than the montmorillonite and illite gouge and maintains a higher permeability after shearing. Permeability reduction via shear is pronounced at shear strains ≲5 and is smaller at higher strain, suggesting that shear-induced permeability reduction is linked to fabric development early in the deformation history. Our results imply that the potential for development of excess pore pressure in low-permeability fault gouge depends on both clay mineralogy and shear strain.},

abstract = {Mudstone permeabilities vary by ten orders of magnitude and by three orders of magnitude at a single porosity. Much of the range at a given porosity can be explained by differences in grain size; at a given effective stress, coarser-grained mudstones are more permeable than finer-grained mudstones, although the difference diminishes with increased burial. Pore size distributions illustrate why more silt-rich mudstones are more permeable than finer mudstones and also show that the loss of porosity and permeability with increasing effective stress is driven primarily by the preferential collapse of large pores. Pore size distributions can also be used to estimate permeability rapidly. None of the existing models are ideal and need to be adjusted and validated through the acquisition of a much larger permeability database of well-characterized mudstones. We also examine the role of faults and fractures as fluid conduits in mudstones. The occurrence of microscopic hydrofractures is inferred from the observation that fluid pressures in sedimentary basins rarely exceed minimum leak-off pressures. The extent to which microfractures enhance mudstone permeability, both instantaneously and over longer periods of geological time, is poorly constrained. Although fault zones in mudstones have generally low permeability, there is abundant evidence for episodic flow along faults in tectonically active regions. The role of faults as fluid conduits during periods of tectonic quiescence is less certain, and the timing and extent of any enhanced permeability and enhanced flow are not well known. In general, conditions conducive to fluid flow along muddy faults include an increase in the activity of the fault, high fluid pressures within the fault zone and the extent of overconsolidation and lithification of the mudstones. },

abstract = {Structural elements of deformation-band fault zones are implemented as volumetrically expressed building blocks, that is, fault facies, in a series of synthetic reservoir geomodels and simulation models. The models are designed and built to reproduce a predefined range of fault system configuration, sedimentary facies configuration, and fault zone architecture. Using petrophysical properties derived from published field studies, the geomodel realizations are run in a reservoir simulator to monitor reservoir responses to variations in modeling factors. The modeled fault zones act as dual barrier-conduit systems, resulting in simulation models that can capture contrasting waterfront velocities, changes in waterfront geometries, and flow channelizing and bifurcation in the fault envelopes. The simulation models also show the development and sweep efficiency of bypassed oil and poorly swept regions because of the presence of the fault zones. Statistical analysis reveals that the fault facies modeling factors can be ranked according to impact on reservoir responses in the following descending order: fault core thickness, the type of displacement function, sedimentary facies configuration, the fraction of total fault throw accommodated by fault core and damage zones, fault system configuration, and maximum damage zone width. Fault core thickness is the most important factor because it governs the space available for fluid flow in the fault-dip direction. Other modeling factors affect the reservoir responses by controlling the geometry and continuity of fluid flow paths in the modeled fault zones.},

abstract = {Abstract  Faults in sedimentary rocks can act as fluid pathways or barriers to flow and display a range of deformation styles. These
features can be explained by behaviours observed in deformation experiments on sedimentary rocks that reveal a transition
from dilatant brittle faulting and permeability enhancement to cataclasis and permeability reduction, with increasing porosity,
grain size and confining pressure. This transition implies that faults in sedimentary rocks are unlikely to act as fluid pathways
shallower than $\sim$3 km, unless the sediments have undergone early cementation, or have been exposed following burial and uplift.
This has important implications for many geological processes, including fluid circulation in geothermal systems, formation
of sediment-hosted mineral deposits and earthquakes in subduction zones. Stratiform Zn–Pb deposits that have been interpreted
as syngenetic, seafloor deposits could instead be interpreted as early epigenetic deposits representing the depth at which
faults change from fluid pathways to barriers.},

abstract = {Numerous brittle deformations related to the Late
Cretaceous inversion of the Mid-Polish Trough (MPT) have
been identified in its various parts using seismic data. The
role of Zechstein evaporitic deposits during basin evolution
and inversion is also described. A model for the Pomera-
nian segment of the MPT has been constructed that includes
significant decoupling between pre-Zechstein basement and
Mesozoic sedimentary infill. In areas without significant in-
fluence of Zechstein deposits on tectonic processes, classical
inversion structures have been interpreted like reverse faults
and uplifted basement blocks. Thickness reductions and lo-
cal angular unconformities pointing to syn-tectonic sedimen-
tation often accompany these inversion structures. Correla-
tion of well and seismic data allows for fairly precise dating
of the inversion activity in various parts of the MPT. For the
NW segment indirect observations suggest that inversion ac-
tivity spanned Turonian to Campanian times, whereas in SE
segment inversion could have started in Coniacian, was ac-
tive in Santonian and Campanian, and reached its peak in
Maastrichtian times. Inversion along the NE boundary of
the MPT (Koszalin-Chojnice tectonic zone) was associated
with strike-slip movements. In this area the first stage of the
inversion-related uplift of axial part of the MPT can be dated
as post-Turonian and pre-Maastrichtian, the second stage,
related to strike-slip movements, as middle Maastrichtian.
Maastrichtian is also the age of transverse strike-slip activ-
ity along Gr ́ jec fault. All these dates generally conform to
             o
the main compressive events within the Alpine-Carpathian
orogenic belt, which suggests some sort of mechanical cou-
pling between this orogenic belt and its foreland.},

@article{Worum2005a,
abstract = {The West Netherlands Basin (WNB) and the neighbouring Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) form the most prominent tectonic features of the onshore Netherlands. The two basins have a common tectonic origin and similar Mesozoic evolution, their Neogene-Quaternary evolution, however, is markedly different. While the WNB is tectonically/seismically inactive and is characterised by uniform Neogene-Quaternary subsidence, in the RVRS fault controlled intra-plate deformation has taken place since Late Oligocene times with pronounced seismic activity. Considering the present-day NE-SW regional extension as well as the similar basin orientation and Mesozoic evolutions one would not expect strikingly different neotectonic activity in the two basins. Detailed analysis of Mesozoic, Tertiary and Quaternary fault patterns revealed that (1) the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic tectonic fabric has great influence on the Cenozoic deformation style of the basin system; (2) present-day faulting in the RVRS is related to the reactivation of pre-existing faults and (3) the Mesozoic fault pattern is slightly different in the two basins. Using a novel technique (three-dimensional (3-D) slip tendency analysis) we aim to determine whether these differences in fault orientation are substantial enough to produce significantly different resolved stresses along the faults. This modelling not only tests a common geological phenomena but indirectly also delivers important constraints regarding the origin of faulting in the study area. During the analysis 3-D geometric models of 84 mapped faults were investigated. The results of this recently developed modelling technique reveal that the faults in both basins should behave similarly under the condition of a laterally homogeneous regional stress field, which is in disagreement with the present-day tectonic activity of the region. On the other hand the modelling also reveals that the predicted tendency of slip is very sensitive to the ratio of the minimum horizontal and the vertical stress (S). As an explanation for the pronounced fault activity in the RVRS and the tectonic quietness of the WNB it is proposed that either the regional extension in the WNB is "weaker" (in term of higher S ratio) than that in the RVRS or the slip thresholds in the two basins are different. The study emphasised that differentiation in the tectonic evolution has already started in the Tertiary, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the different tectonic stress field and/or slip threshold between the two areas is directly related to the origin of the Cenozoic rifting in the RVRS. Several hypotheses are discussed to account for these two possibilities, taking into account the lithospheric structure and the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the two basins as well as surrounding areas.},

In addition, the correlation parameter r is instrumental is specifying the level of neutron dose, a controlled variable, which will minimize the standard error of age.

Geothermal gradients, thermal conductivities, and heat flow have been investigated for most of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic clastic unit as well as the Upper Paleozoic carbonate-evaporite unit. Regional heat flow variations with depth occur which are closely related to the hydrodynamics governed by the topography and geology. The blanketing effect of low-conductivity shaly formations may cause a temperature anomaly in the south where the thickest Phanerozoic cover exists. However, the Weyburn high can be explained only partially in this way. Hydrodynamics has also contributed to formation of the temperature anomaly there. The process of forming the anomaly by the blanketing effect and hydrodynamics also contributed to oil deposition. There is a correlation between Mississippian oil occurrences in the southeastern part of the basin and the location of the Weyburn temperature high. },

abstract = {A chemical kinetic model is presented that uses Arrhenius rate constants to calculate vitrinite elemental composition as a function of time and temperature. The model uses distributions of activation energies for each of four reactions: elimination of water, carbon dioxide, methane and higher hydrocarbons. The resulting composition is used to calculate vitrinite reflectance via correlations between elemental composition and reflectance. The correlations are derived from published measurements. The model is valid for %Ro values from slightly less than 0.3 to slightly greater than 4. Model calculations are compared to published vitrinite data from both laboratory experiments and sedimentary columns where adequate thermal histories are available. Calculated and measured %Ro values generally agree within 0.1 at low rank and 0.4 at high rank, which is comparable to uncertainties in the experimental values. This confirms our starting premise that vitrinite reflectance is properly described by standard chemical kinetics with activation energies that extrapolate from laboratory to geological maturation temperatures. The model indicates that the relationship between the extent of oil generation and vitrinite reflectance is nearly independent of heating rate.},

abstract = {Methods for dating shallow faults in the Earth's crust are still evolving and their reliability remains controversial. Based on results from well-preserved fault gouge samples from the AlpTransit deep tunnel site in Switzerland, we propose a simplified and readily applicable approach to investigate and date clay-rich gouge zones. We collected 10 samples covering a north-south section of 15 km. All sampled faults are developed in orthogneiss host rock, have a rather consistent approximately northwest-southeast strike, are mainly normal, and are related to northeast-southwest orogen-parallel extension during Alpine exhumation. Fine-grained clay separates from the fault gouges consist of illite 1M/1M and 2M polytypes, smectite and chlorite, with minor amounts of feldspar in some sample fractions. The K-Ar ages for <2 $\mu$m illite fractions range between 7.1 and 9.5 Ma (mean 8.5 ± 1.4 [2$\sigma$] Ma) and for <0.1 $\mu$m range between 3.9 and 7.2 Ma (mean 6.0 ± 2.1 [2$\sigma$] Ma); ages consistently decrease with grain size. These ages are close to published apatite fission track ages of ca. 6 Ma from the immediate vicinity, consistent with illite stability in fault gouges generally occurring at temperatures slightly above the partial annealing zone of apatite. The influence on authigenic illite gouge ages of potential contamination by fine-grained cataclastic protolith was evaluated by dating coarse K-feldspar fractions from host-rock clasts in two samples. The K-feldspar ages are significantly older, ca. 13.5 Ma. However, measured illite K-Ar ages are quite constant and do not correlate with amount of K-feldspar impurity, which suggests that fine-grained cataclastic feldspar grains have isotopically reequilibrated, presumably due to fluid-rock interaction within the fault zone.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Pyrenees, a mountain range between Iberia and Eurasia, has remained the subject of many debates between geologists and geophysicists for a long time. By combining the identification of seafloor spreading anomalies A33o to M0 in the Bay of Biscay with those in the North Atlantic, we have derived a position of a mean pole of rotation for the entire opening of the Bay of Biscay. Four hundred kilometers of shortening took place between the Iberian and Eurasian plates in the Pyrenean domain during the opening of the Bay of Biscay, from chrons M0 to A33o time (118 to 80 Ma). The deep seismic Etude Continentale et Oc{\'{e}}anique par R{\'{e}}flexion et r{\'{e}}fraction Sismique (ECORS) profile shot across the Pyrenees and teleseismic data show the presence of two distinct slabs, which dip to the north. The southern slab is linked to the subduction of the neo-Tethys Ocean, which was created from late Jurassic to early Aptian. Simultaneously, elongated back arc basins formed along the future Pyrenean domain. This slab was active from at least 118 Ma (early Aptian) to 100 Ma (late Albian). The northern slab, active since 85 Ma, is linked to the subduction of the lower continental crust located south of the Pyrenean domain. In the upper crust, normal faults as well as the north Pyrenean fault became reverse faults, and former back arc basins were inverted, giving rise to the uplift of the Pyrenees as a double asymmetrical wedge.},

abstract = {40Ar/39Ar data for biotite and amphibole from six plutonic complexes of the Monteregian petrographic province in Quebec, Canada, are presented. Generally uncomplicated and concordant incremental heating spectra are observed, although there is evidence for minor excess 40Ar at several localities. Biotites and amphiboles are concordant, consistent with rapid cooling of the high-level complexes. Ages for different phases of individual complexes are analytically indistinguishable and suggest that the various principal lithologies are cogenetic. The 40Ar/39Ar ages of six Monteregian complexes (St. Hilaire, Rougemont, Johnson, Shefford, Brome, Megantic) all fall within the very restricted range of 124 ± 1 m.y. It is suggested that all of the Monteregian plutons, with the exception of Oka, were formed within a short interval (1–2 m.y.) during the Cretaceous, consistent with paleomagmetic results. The new ages, along with geochemical characteristics, support derivation of the alkaline magmas by a fixed mantle hot spot which also produced broadly similar complexes in New England and the chain of New England Seamounts. },

@article{Bjorlykke1988,
abstract = {Mathematical calculations of thermal convection have been carried out using a porous three-player model to simulate pore-water flow in a sedimentary basin with layers of different permeabilities. The calculated flow lines demonstrate that even very thin layers (\textless 1 m) with low permeability, like shales in a more permeable sandstone sequence, will split potentially larger convection cells into smaller units of clean sandstone beds which may then be too small to exceed the critical Rayleigh number. In a situation where we have horizontal isotherms, a sandstone bed with 1 Darcy permeability must have a thickness of more than 330 m without shale interbeds for convection to occur. This situation is rarely met in sedimentary basins. In the case of sloping isotherms, non-Rayleigh convection will always occur but the flow rate is proportional to the effective thickness of the bed and the slope of the isotherms. Calculations suggest that the flow rates are insignificant for diagnetic reactions except in situations where we have steeply sloping isotherms eg, around salt domes and igneous or hydrothermal intrusions. Analyses of formation waters from sedimentary basins like the North Sea often show evidence of a crude stratification of the pore water with respect to salinity and isotopic composition. This is evidence suggesting that large scale convection, or other types of mixing, does not take place and positive salinity depth gradient may help to physically stabilize the formation water. The fact that many of the shallow reservoir rocks from the North Sea have formation water with low salinity and negative [delta] 18O values suggest that this is modified meteoric water and that migration of petroleum from deeper parts of the basin occurred as a separate phase along restricted migration pathways and was not associated with a high flux of pore water. In the absence of thermal convection the total pore water flux through sandstones will be rather small except locally where we may have focused compactional flow through small cross-sections. Diagenetic reactions will, therefore, normally be relatively isochemical during deeper burial.},

abstract = {On the basis of 31 pollen diagrams and additional data for botanical macrofossils an analysis is made of the Last Interglacial (Eemian) climatic history in Western and Central Europe. The main tool for this analysis is the climatic indicator species method. Only selected woody species are used for the quantification of data. Partial climatic range diagrams are presented for: Abies alba, Acer monspessulanum, Acer tataricum, Buxus sempervirens, Tilia tomentosa. The problem of time correlation and pollen zonation of the Eemian is discussed. The climatic analysis itself is based on an improved version of the indicator species method. In this version not every site is analysed for its climatic values. Instead maps and tables on the migrational history of Hedera, Ilex, Buxus, Abies and species of Acer, Tilia and Abies are the basis for climatic maps showing respectively January and July isotherms for the periods of the Corylus zone (E4a) and the Carpinus zone (E5). It is concluded that mean January temperatures were as much as 3[degree sign]C higher at Amsterdam (The Netherlands), than at present, and mean temperatures in July were 2[degree sign]C higher. However, the thermal maximum in winter was later (zone E5) than the summer thermal maximum (zone E4a). Winter temperatures changed parallel to rise and fall of global sea-level. Precipitation changes are more difficult to estimate. In the first part of the Eemian precipitation must have been relatively low, but from zone E4b onward it increased to higher values, reaching 800 mm and probably substantially more in zones E5 and E6. Hence the Eemian climate was in its beginning relatively more contintental, and later (from E4b onward) more oceanic. However, as compared with the Holocene, the Eemian climate was, generally speaking, more oceanic.},

abstract = {The San Andreas fault accommodates 28-34 mm yr(-1) of right lateral motion of the Pacific crustal plate northwestward past the North American plate. In California, the fault is composed of two distinct locked segments that have produced great earthquakes in historical times, separated by a 150-km-long creeping zone. The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) is a scientific borehole located northwest of Parkfield, California, near the southern end of the creeping zone. Core was recovered from across the actively deforming San Andreas fault at a vertical depth of 2.7 km (ref. 1). Here we report laboratory strength measurements of these fault core materials at in situ conditions, demonstrating that at this locality and this depth the San Andreas fault is profoundly weak (coefficient of friction, 0.15) owing to the presence of the smectite clay mineral saponite, which is one of the weakest phyllosilicates known. This Mg-rich clay is the low-temperature product of metasomatic reactions between the quartzofeldspathic wall rocks and serpentinite blocks in the fault. These findings provide strong evidence that deformation of the mechanically unusual creeping portions of the San Andreas fault system is controlled by the presence of weak minerals rather than by high fluid pressure or other proposed mechanisms. The combination of these measurements of fault core strength with borehole observations yields a self-consistent picture of the stress state of the San Andreas fault at the SAFOD site, in which the fault is intrinsically weak in an otherwise strong crust.},

abstract = {Seismic refraction data obtained along fifteen lines in southern Germany in the 60's and in 1982-1984 were used to derive a 3-D model of crustal structure below the "South-German Triangle" bounded by the Bohemian Massif in the east, the Alps in the south and the Rhinegraben in the west. Both the older and the more recent data were interpreted with the same techniques taking into account the results of published crustal information. Along three lines the observations could be interpreted as a reversed system and here both traveltime and amplitude information was used applying two-dimensional (2-D) raytrace modelling resulting in 2-D models controlled by traveltimes and amplitudes. These three crustal cross sections supplement an existing 3-D model for southwest Germany. The characteristic features of the crustal structure of the South-German Triangle can be summarized as follows: An intermediate boundary, identified by many authors as Conrad discontinuity, is found in its central part at depths between 16 and 18 km. Towards the northwest and south it descends to 20 and 22 km, respectively. In the region of the Black Forest it occurs at a rather shallow level at depths of only 14 km. The depth to the Moho reaches values between 27 and 28 km in the central part of the South-German Triangle. Beneath the Black Forest and the southwestern part of the Swabian Jura, the crustal thickness is reduced ranging from 25 to 26 km. To the northwest the Moho dips only slightly, but to the northeast under the Bohemian Massif it reaches depths up to 35 km. Beneath the northern foreland of the Alps the Moho descends gradually to about 40 km depth near the northern margin of the Alps. A low-velocity zone in the middle crust changes its characteristics throughout the area of investigation and is even absent in some areas. The velocity decrease is generally less than 0.3 km/s, except under the central and northern Black Forest, where the velocity decreases by as much as 0.5 km/s. The existence of a laminated lower crust, i.e. a crust which comprises layers of alternating high and low velocity as was found beneath the Black Forest, is also indicated in some of the data obtained in 1982-1984 and shown in this contribution.},

abstract = {Evidence from rock microstructures, mass transfer and isotopic exchange indicates that substantial quantities of aqueous fluids are involved in low- and medium-grade regional metamorphism. Similar conclusions are drawn from many retrograde environments, whereas high-grade metamorphic fluids may be melt dominated. The mobile fluids play essential roles in metamorphic reactions, mass transport and deformation processes. These processes are linked by the mechanical consequences of meta- morphic fluid pressures (Pr) generally being greater than or equal to the minimum principal compressive stress. Under such conditions meta- morphic porosity comprises grain boundary tubules and bubbles together with continuously generated (and healed) microfractures. Deform- ation results in significant interconnected porosity and hence enhanced permeability. Lithologically and structurally controlled perme- ability variations may cause effective fluid channelling. Simple Rayleigh-Darcy modelling of a uniformly permeable, crustal slab shows that convective instability of metamorphic fluid is expected at the permeabilities suggested for the high Pf metamorphic conditions. Complex, large- scale convective cells operating in overpressured, but capped systems may provide a satisfactory explanation for the large fluid/rock ratios and extensive mass transport demonstrated for many low- and medium-grade metamorphic environ- ments. Such large-scale fluid circulation may have important consequences for heat transfer in and the thermal evolution of metamorphic belts.},

abstract = {Heating due to lateral introduction of hot fluids is becoming an increasingly recognized feature of the thermal histories of sedimentary basins. In some basins, heating by fluids may have an important effect on hydrocarbon source rock maturation history, so that quantification of the magnitude and timing of heating become essential elements in hydrocarbon prospectivity. In other cases, determining the time of fluid heating in a reservoir may provide a key constraint on hydrocarbon migration history. Examples are presented using AFTA apatite fission track analysis and vitrinite reflectance (VR) data to identify and quantify fluid heating in well sequences from several regions. In the West of Shetland region, in the vicinity of the Rona Ridge, non-linear palaeotemperature profiles defined by AFTA and VR results provide evidence of local heating shallow in the section. AFTA timing constraints suggest introduction of heated fluids produced by nearby Tertiary intrusive activity, although the time constraints are broad because of the low maximum palaeotemperatures involved (R0max \textless 0.6%). In a well from Asia, transient maximum palaeotemperatures \textgreater 120degreesC resulted in R0max \textgreater 0.6% in an Eocene section, with AFTA constraining the fluid flow event responsible for the early to mid Miocene (25 to 10 Ma). On the North West Shelf of Australia transient fluid flow associated with hydrocarbon leakage, and possibly charge, has been previously identified by a combination of AFTA, VR and fluid inclusion homogenization temperature (Th) results. In the East Swan-2 well, a fracture inclusion in quartz from shallow Eocene sandstones gives a minimum Th value of 88degreesC, c. 40degreesC higher than the present temperature. AFTA and VR data show no direct evidence of sustained heating at such a temperature, and can only be reconciled if the duration of heating was c. 20 000 years. The results are consistent with this event being associated with passage of a hot brine and hydrocarbon fluid (O'Brien and Woods, 1995). These case studies demonstrate that a combination of thermal history tools can be used to identify and quantify the thermal effect of fluid flow, potentially allowing much tighter constraints on hydrocarbon generation and migration histories.},

abstract = {An integrated fluid inclusion and stable isotope study was carried out on hydrothermal veins (Sb-bearing quartz veins, metal-bearing fluorite–barite–quartz veins) from the Schwarzwald district, Germany. A total number of 106 Variscan (quartz veins related to Variscan orogenic processes) and post-Variscan deposits were studied by microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy, and stable isotope analysis. The fluid inclusions in Variscan quartz veins are of the H2O–NaCl–(KCl) type, have low salinities (0–10 wt.% eqv. NaCl) and high Th values (150–350°C). Oxygen isotope data for quartz range from +2.8‰ to +12.2‰ and calculated $\delta$18OH2O values of the fluid are between −12.5‰ and +4.4‰. The $\delta$D values of water extracted from fluid inclusions vary between −49‰ and +4‰. The geological framework, fluid inclusion and stable isotope characteristics of the Variscan veins suggest an origin from regional metamorphic devolatilization processes. By contrast, the fluid inclusions in post-Variscan fluorite, calcite, barite, quartz, and sphalerite belong to the H2O–NaCl–CaCl2 type, have high salinities (22–25 wt.% eqv. NaCl) and lower Th values of 90–200°C. A low-salinity fluid (0–15 wt.% eqv. NaCl) was observed in late-stage fluorite, calcite, and quartz, which was trapped at similar temperatures. The $\delta$18O values of quartz range between +11.1‰ and +20.9‰, which translates into calculated $\delta$18OH2O values between −11.0‰ and +4.4‰. This range is consistent with $\delta$18OH2O values of fluid inclusion water extracted from fluorite (−11.6‰ to +1.1‰). The $\delta$D values of directly measured fluid inclusion water range between −29‰ and −1‰, −26‰ and −15‰, and −63‰ and +9‰ for fluorite, quartz, and calcite, respectively. Calculations using the fluid inclusion and isotope data point to formation of the fluorite–barite–quartz veins under near-hydrostatic conditions. The $\delta$18OH2O and $\delta$D data, particularly the observed wide range in $\delta$D, indicate that the mineralization formed through large-scale mixing of a basement-derived saline NaCl–CaCl2 brine with meteoric water. Our comprehensive study provides evidence for two fundamentally different fluid systems in the crystalline basement. The Variscan fluid regime is dominated by fluids generated through metamorphic devolatilization and fluid expulsion driven by compressional nappe tectonics. The onset of post-Variscan extensional tectonics resulted in replacement of the orogenic fluid regime by fluids which have distinct compositional characteristics and are related to a change in the principal fluid sources and the general fluid flow patterns. This younger system shows remarkably persistent geochemical and isotopic features over a prolonged period of more than 100 Ma.},

abstract = {This study uses numerical simulations to define the salient controls on regional groundwater flow in 3-D mountainous terrain by systematically varying topographic and hydrogeologic variables. Topography for idealized multiple-basin mountainous terrain is derived from geomatic data and literature values. Water table elevation, controlled by the ratio of recharge to hydraulic conductivity, largely controls the distribution of recharged water into local, regional, and perpendicular flow systems, perpendicular flow being perpendicular to the regional topographic gradient. Both the relative (%) and absolute (m3/d) values of regional flow and perpendicular flow are examined. The relationship between regional flow and water table elevation is highly nonlinear. With lower water table elevations, relative and absolute regional flow dramatically increase and decrease, respectively, as the water table is lowered further. However, for higher water table elevations above the top of the headwater stream, changes in water table elevation have little effect on regional flow. Local flow predominates in high water table configurations, with regional and perpendicular flow <15% and <10%, respectively, of total recharge in the models tested. Both the relative and the maximum absolute regional flow are directly controlled by the degree of incision of the mountain drainage network; the elevation of mountain ridges is considerably less important. The percentage of the headwater stream with perennial streamflow is a potentially powerful indicator of regional flow in all water table configurations and may be a good indicator of the susceptibility of mountain groundwater systems to increased aridity.},

abstract = {Fluvial sandstones are an important reservoir type for the petroleum industry. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, large hydrocarbon discoveries in the Norwegian North Sea in fluvial strata prompted the need for generating geologically meaningful, stochastic, object-based models of fluvial deposits. The aim of this focus was to allow the geologist to provide the reservoir engineers with a more realistic representation of permeability contrasts within channelised, fluvial deposits by being able to use appropriate measurements from outcrop analogues as direct input data into the modelling software. This initiative resulted in the development of a suite of geologically driven, stochastic modelling algorithms supported by an extensive fieldwork program aimed at collecting stratigraphic and quantitative data from ancient outcrop analogues to support enhanced reservoir characterisation and geological modelling. Today, these reservoirs are still important hydrocarbon producing fields with accurate reservoir description and 3D modelling capabilities playing a vital role in targeting remaining oil, especially now that many of the fields on the Norwegian continental shelf are past peak production and are in a decline phase. As both computing capabilities and quantitative outcrop analogue studies have increased the understanding of, and the ability to model fluvial reservoirs, so have stochastic modelling techniques continued to provide the most suitable and robust means of building geologically realistic 3D reservoir models that incorporate increased geological understanding and heterogeneity complexity. In the recent past, a multitude of data, such as seismic and production data have been used to condition the stochastic algorithms. This review paper aims to outline the role of stochastic algorithms in building geologically-realistic, 3D fluvial reservoir models and highlight the success of these developments with case studies from both producing fields and ancient outcrop analogue studies. Finally, the paper will allude to possible improvements in stochastic fluvial modelling and future directions in the modelling of fluvial petroleum reservoirs. These include the use of physical or process-based models, high-resolution near wellbore models, and multi-point statistics, that allow for more realistic representations of heterogeneities of fluvial deposits at a variety of scales and by a variety of methods.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic consequences of a glaciation/deglaciation cycle within an intercratonic sedimentary basin on subsurface transport processes is assessed using numerical models. In our analysis we consider the effects of mechanical ice sheet loading, permafrost formation, variable density fluids, and lithospheric flexure on solute/isotope transport, groundwater residence times, and transient hydraulic head distributions. The simulations are intended to apply, in a generic sense, to intercratonic sedimentary basins that would have been near the southern limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum (∼20 ka B.P.), such as the Williston, Michigan, and Illinois basins. We show that in such basins fluid flow and recharge rates are strongly elevated during glaciation as compared to nonglacial periods. Furthermore, our results illustrate that steady state hydrodynamic conditions in these basins are probably never reached during a 32.5 ka cycle of advance and retreat of a wet-based ice sheet. Present-day hydrogeological conditions across formerly glaciated areas are likely to still reflect the impact of the last glaciation and associated processes that ended locally more than 10 ka B.P. Our results reveal characteristic spatial patterns of underpressure and overpressure that occur in aquitards and aquifers, respectively, as a result of recent glaciation. The calculated emplacement of low salinity, isotopically light glacial meltwater along basin margins is roughly consistent with observations from formerly glaciated basins in North America. The modeling presented in this study will help to improve the management of groundwater resources in formerly glaciated basins as well as to evaluate the viability on geological timescales of nuclear waste repositories located at high latitudes.

abstract = {Major low-angle normal faults juxtapose different structural levels of the crust that record both brittle and ductile deformation. Field relationships alone cannot establish whether these different responses to deformation represent (1) parts of a single process of exhumation along the detachment or (2) two separate events, with the later, more discrete brittle detachment exhuming a fossil ductile shear zone from depth. These two general models are critically assessed for the low-angle normal Simplon Fault Zone (SFZ) in the central Alps. The SFZ shows a spatial transition from a broad ductile mylonitic shear zone to a discrete brittle detachment with identical kinematics. The age of the ductile shear zone and ductile-brittle transition is controversial. We present a detailed geochronological study based on fission track, 40Ar/39Ar, and Rb/Sr microsampling dating, coupled with structural, petrological, and chemical analyses that provides tight constraints on SFZ timing. Discontinuous mineral cooling ages over a broad range of temperatures across the fault zone argue for fault activity between 20 and 3 Ma. On the basis of synkinematic white mica in low-temperature shear zones and necks of foliation boudinage, the brittle-ductile transition in the footwall could be dated at ∼14.5–10 Ma. Overall, the data presented here are consistent with a continuous transition from ductile shearing to a more localized zone of brittle deformation within the same geological framework, over a period of ∼15 Ma. The SFZ is therefore an example of a telescoped crustal section within a single major low-angle fault, involving a continuous period of exhumation rather than a two-stage structure.},

abstract = {Seventy chalk samples from four formations in the overpressured Danish central North Sea have been analyzed to investigate how correlations of porosity and sonic velocity with burial depth are affected by varying mineralogy, fluid pressure, and early introduction of petroleum. The results show that porosity and sonic velocity follow the most consistent depth trends when fluid pressure and pore-volume compressibility are considered. Quartz content up to 10% has no marked effect, but more than 5% clay causes lower porosity and velocity. The mineralogical effect differs between P-wave and shear velocity so that smectite-bearing chalk has a high Poisson's ratio in the water-saturated case, but a low value in the dry case. Oil-bearing chalk has up to 25 units higher porosity than water-saturated chalk at similar depth but similar velocity, probably because hydrocarbons prevent pore-filling cementation but not pore-structure stiffening cementation in this presumably water-wet chalk. These results should improve the modeling of chalk background velocity for seismic inversion analysis. When describing the porosity-reducing process, pore-volume compressibility should probably be disregarded when correcting for fluid pressure because the cementing ions originate from stylolites, which are mechanically similar to fractures. We find that cementation occurs over a relatively short depth interval.},

abstract = {The discontinuity surface between Earth crust and mantle, the so-called Moho, is commonly estimated by means of seismic or gravimetric methods. Usually these methods do not yield the same result since they are based on different geological and geophysical hypotheses, as well as different data types, also in terms of quality and spatial distribution. In particular, global crust models based only on seismic data (e.g. the CRUST2.0 model) can be locally very accurate since seismic profiles give an almost direct observation of the actual crust structure, but can be quite uninformative in large regions where no data are available or they are too inhomogeneous. On the contrary, when using satellite gravity observations like those provided by the ESA mission GOCE, information on the Moho can be inferred from a uniform and global data set. However, Moho models estimated by gravity data are in general characterized by simplified hypotheses to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution of the inverse gravitational problem. The aim of this work is to attenuate these drawbacks by combining the seismic global model CRUST2.0 with gravity observations from the GOCE satellite mission. More specifically, the used GOCE data are grid values at mean satellite altitude estimated by the so-called space-wise approach. After reducing the data to a two-layer model by removing the effect of topography, bathymetry and sediments, a combined inversion driven by a priori information on the CRUST2.0 accuracy and by the error covariance structure of the GOCE grids is performed. In addition, the observation errors as well as the error due to the data reduction are tentatively taken into account to estimate the accuracy of the final Moho model. The result is an update of the CRUST2.0 Moho model with a 0.5{degrees} x 0.5{degrees} resolution, which at the same time contains seismic and geological information and it is consistent, at 20 mE level, to the actually observed gravity field. A first comparison with the CRUST2.0 Moho shows that in the continental crust the mean difference between the two models is of the order of 1.5 km with standard deviations depending on the considered region. As expected, the main variations (standard deviation of the order of 7 km) are located in South America, Africa and Antarctica where very few data in the CRUST2.0 were originally used. In the rest of the world, differences have a standard deviation of about 4 km. As for the oceanic crust, it can be noted that the corrections to the CRUST2.0 model are of the order of 3 km (mean value) with a standard deviation of 6 km. Finally, the solution computed in this paper has been compared with a set of Moho models at different scales from global to local ones showing that it is reasonably consistent (differences of about 5 km standard deviation) also with seismic observations.},

Giovanni area (Rapolano Terme, Italy). This morphotectonic feature, 250 m long, 30 m wide and 10 m high, formed from supersaturated hot waters (39.9°C) flowing from thermal springs aligned along the trace of the normal fault dissecting travertines not older than Late Pleistocene (24 ± 3 ka). A straight, continuous fissure with a maximum width of 20 cm occurs at the top of the ridge, along its crest. Hot fluids flow from cones mainly located at the extremities of the ridge, where travertine is depositing. The travertine fissure-ridge shows an asymmetrical profile since it buries the fault scarp. The difference in height of slopes corresponds to the vertical displacement of the normal fault. Fissuring of the recent travertine deposits along the strike of the crestal fissure, as well as recent hydrothermal circulation, lead us to believe that the Terme S. Giovanni normal fault may be currently active. On the whole, the Terme S. Giovanni fissure ridge can be defined as a travertine fault trace fissure-ridge, adding a helpful example for studying the relationship between faulting and travertine deposition.},

abstract = {Environmental tracer data is commonly coupled with a simplified analytical model (e.g., exponential model) to interpret the aquifer recharge rate from tracer-based groundwater age. Can we still use this approach if the aquifer is heterogeneous? In this study we use a series of demonstrative numerical simulations to better understand how heterogeneity influences the spatial distribution of groundwater age and the interpretation of the recharge rate within an unconfined aquifer. Eight discontinuous horizontal lenses of contrasting hydraulic conductivity were arbitrarily added to a homogeneous base case. The apparent recharge rate was calculated at each node using the simulated mean age in the exponential analytical solution. The apparent recharge rate in the heterogeneous cases was then compared to the known simulated recharge rate to quantify the magnitude of error and its distribution in the flow field. For demonstration purposes, the reasonable application of the exponential model in heterogeneous aquifers is constrained to the case where the absolute error in the estimated recharge rate is ???25%. From the simulations conducted, lenses with a contrasting hydraulic conductivity of ten times or less had little impact on obtaining useable recharge rate estimates (absolute error ???25% in ???10% of the domain). Conversely, hydraulic conductivity contrasts greater than ten times had a significant impact on perturbing the flow field and inducing geometrically complex and disconnected areas of under and overestimation in the interpreted recharge rate (absolute error ???25% reduced to as low as 39% of the domain). The reduced suitability of the exponential model in this case can be partly overcome by convergence in the average recharge rate obtained from unbiased samples collected from multiple locations. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Hydrogeochemical analyses were used to determine the origin of the water and show that sodium, chloride, and sulfate originate from dissolving evaporites that are influenced by meteoric groundwater. The circulation depths of the Aachen thermal water is estimated to be \textgreater3500 m using SiO2-geothermometry and the regional geothermal gradient of about 30vv°C/km. The deep circulation in Paleozoic sandstones, siltstones and shales and a considerable residence time allow rock water reactions which explain the concentrations of Ba, Sr, F and Si. While the thermal water rises into Upper Devonian limestones carbonates are dissolved. Cooler fresh water from the vicinity contributes to the thermal aquifer depending on the pressure head of the springs. Sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation can be observed as soon as the water temperature is below 65vv°C.},

This has been widely attributed to Paleocene regional uplift resulting from igneous underplating related to the Iceland mantle plume. Our compilation of paleothermal and compaction data reveals spatial and temporal patterns of exhumation showing little correspondence with the postulated influence of underplating, instead being dominated by kilometer-scale variations across Cenozoic compressional structures, which in several basins are demonstrably of Neogene age. We propose that crustal compression, due to plate boundary forces transmitted into the plate interior, was the major cause of Cenozoic uplift in southern Britain, witnessing a high strength crust in western Europe.},

abstract = {This study presents silicon isotope data for rivers and groundwater from the Bengal Basin. Variations of Si isotope ratios were analyzed by means of high-resolution MC-ICP-MS using a NuPlasma HR. The rivers show typical positive $\delta$30Si values between 1.3 and 1.7‰, whereas the groundwater samples show decreasing $\delta$30Si values from 1.3‰ in shallow groundwater to − 0.2‰ in the deeper groundwater. Beside a very distinctive isotope composition, the concentration of dissolved Si in these groundwater samples is 2–3 times higher than in river samples taken during dry season. The resulting Si flux by groundwater (9.3×1010 mol yr−1) is on the order of the combined Ganges–Brahmaputra Si fluxes, and equals 40% of the total (river+groundwater) annual Si flux into the Bay of Bengal. Given the significant large flux and distinctive isotope composition means that the overall isotopic input into the ocean is different from riverine values. However, a sound knowledge of all inputs into the ocean and of how these inputs might vary throughout time is mandatory, in order to correctly interpret palaeo-records of $\delta$30Si variations as recorded in sedimentary diatom opal from the last glacial maximum. We extrapolate our results from the Bengal Basin onto a global scale and assess the ocean's sensitivity to changes in inputs, as triggered by large-scale events, such as glaciation periods, where the hydrological cycle might be out of steady state due to the build-up of large continental ice-shields. In such a glaciation scenario, riverine vs. groundwater inputs can be shifted, favoring isotopically lighter groundwater over heavier river inputs into the ocean. The model proves impossible to change the biogenic output to a significant degree, on time scales of a few thousand years, by just changing the isotope inputs into the ocean.},

abstract = {Determination of true formation temperature from measured bottom-hole temperature (BHT) is important for well log interpretation and geothermal studies, especially with the current realization of the role of temperature in hydrocarbon maturation. A "bulk" thermal diffusivity of the borehole-rock system of approximately 0.003 cm2/sec, initially suggested by Leblanc et al (1982), is confirmed by comparison with a two-media borehole model. In general, time-consecutive BHT measurements exhibit slower stabilization than those predicted by thermal conduction models. A simple model of thermal stabilization of a borehole with continued circulation after cessation of drilling is proposed. By modeling the thermal sink due to continued circulation of drilling mud as an exponentially decaying sink, thermal stabilization curves more consistent with observation are obtained. A good estimate of true formation temperature can be obtained by a curve-matching technique where the observed BHT data are well behaved and the physical conditions in the borehole closely match the assumed model. However, it is virtually impossible in some cases to obtain a precise estimate of true formation temperature with BHT measurements from well log runs with current BHT stabilization models.},

abstract = {To better predict how ocean acidification will affect coral reefs, it is important to understand how biogeochemical cycles on reefs alter carbonate chemistry over various temporal and spatial scales. This study quantifies the contribution of shallow porewater exchange (as quantified from advective chamber incubations) and fresh groundwater discharge (as traced by Rn-222) to total alkalinity (TA) dynamics on a fringing coral reef lagoon along the southern Pacific island of Rarotonga over a tidal and diel cycle. Benthic alkalinity fluxes were affected by the advective circulation of water through permeable sediments, with net daily flux rates of carbonate alkalinity ranging from -1.55 to 7.76 mmol m(-2) d(-1), depending on the advection rate. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) was a source of TA to the lagoon, with the highest flux rates measured at low tide, and an average daily TA flux of 1080 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at the sampling site. Both sources of TA were important on a reef-wide basis, although SGD acted solely as a delivery mechanism of TA to the lagoon, while porewater advection was either a sink or source of TA dependent on the time of day. This study describes overlooked sources of TA to coral reef ecosystems that can potentially alter water column carbonate chemistry. We suggest that porewater and groundwater fluxes of TA should be taken into account in ocean acidification models in order to properly address changing carbonate chemistry within coral reef ecosystems.},

Our purpose is to use this information to determine a continuous profile of the mineralogy with depth. The well-log derived mineralogy is then combined with a petrophysical model to infer continuous permeability and saturation profiles in chlorite-bearing sandstone formations. Our mineralogical inversion algorithm combines a cluster analysis of the raw data and their inversion using the generalized nonlinear inverse method developed by Tarantola and Valette [1982]. A field case is treated concerning a borehole intersecting an alternation of sandstones and shales. The mineralogical logs we obtained are in very good agreement with the mineral proportions measured independently on core samples. Mineralogical profiles are combined with a specific textural model to derive a continuous profile of permeability. We found a very good agreement between this computed permeability log and independent core permeability measurements over 3 orders of magnitude.},

The measured 3He/4He ratios range between 0.40 and 1.02 Ra (Ra is the atmospheric 3He/4He ratio of 1.39 � 10&#8722;6), with 4He/20Ne values between 0.33 and 4.92, revealing a mixture of three components to the total helium: (1) atmospheric helium, (2) helium with a crustal signature, and (3) mantle-derived helium. The air-corrected 3He/4He ratios fall between 0.2 Ra and 0.9 Ra. Samples from the 2117&#8211;3196 m depth show a relatively constant helium isotope composition (0.35&#8211;0.46 Ra), indicating that &#8764;5% of the helium in this section the Pacific Plate is derived from the mantle. The contribution of mantle-derived helium increases slightly in the transition from the Pacific Plate to the North American Plate and reaches maximal values of &#8764;12% on the North American Plate (below &#8764;3500 m borehole depth). On the basis of our observations, we suggest that the San Andreas Fault plays a role for fluid flux from greater depths, but higher amounts of mantle-derived fluids rise up through other, more permeable faults, situated on the North American Plate of the San Andreas Fault Zone (SAFZ). Lateral fluid dispersion at shallow depths through permeable country rock of the North American Plate may explain the observed increase in 3He/4He ratios with increasing distance to the SAF.},

Permeabilities were measured at different effective consolidation stresses ranging from 2.5 to 60 MPa with a 30,000 mg L&#8722;1 NaCl solution. Samples represent a wide spectrum of mudstone types with clay size particle contents ranging from 13 to 66%. Porosities range from 6 to 27%; pore size data show that porosity loss is driven primarily by collapse of the largest pores. Our results confirm and considerably extend previously reported results indicating the influence of clay content on pore size distributions and the way they evolve as a result of compaction. Vertical permeabilities, measured using the transient pulse decay technique, range from 2.4 � 10&#8722;22 m2 to 1.6 � 10&#8722;19 m2. Horizontal permeabilities range from 3.9 � 10&#8722;21 m2 to 9.5 � 10&#8722;19 m2, overlapping with but generally higher than vertical permeabilities. In general, permeability decreases logarithmically with porosity. The relationship between permeability and porosity is strongly influenced by clay content, especially at higher porosities. Ratios of horizontal to vertical permeability measured on four samples range from 1.7 to 11.8, implying the influence of both particle alignment and sedimentological heterogeneity. We have used the data to calibrate two permeability models. For the Kozeny-Carman model, values of 200 and 1000 for the product of shape and tortuosity factors provide the best fit for the vertical and horizontal permeabilities, respectively. The calibrated Yang-Aplin model predicts the permeability of almost all the samples to within a factor of �3 over a 4 orders of magnitude range of permeability.},

abstract = {The Jurassic-Cenozoic structural evolution of the eastern North Sea Basin is influenced by the central North Sea Dome, the Danish Megablock, the Tornquist Zone and the South Swedish Dome. The central North Sea Dome is a composite dome comprising the Triple Junction Dome, the Central Graben Dome and the Friesland Dome. The Danish Megablock, newly recognized here, is a first-order tectonic element between the Central Graben and the Tornquist Zone. In Jurassic-Cretaceous time it was tilted towards the east during uplift of the Central Graben Dome, whereas the movement was reversed during the Cenozoic post-rift subsidence. Contemporaneous with the westward tilting of the Danish Megablock, the South Swedish Dome was uplifted to the east. The uplift-subsidence reversal across the eastern North Sea Basin links the collapse of the Central Graben Dome and the tilt reversal of the Danish Megablock with the uplift of the South Swedish Dome. The uplift followed by subsidence probably involved mass flow in the asthenosphere to account for the observed balance between post-rift subsidence and marginal uplift. The model explains the uplift of both the South Swedish Dome and southern England as the result of Cenozoic post-rift subsidence of the Mesozoic Central Graben Dome.},

abstract = {Abstract Two chalk data sets from the Central North Sea (UK/Norway and Denmark) with a similar lithological classification and porosity values (5-20%) have a difference in permeability of up to three orders of magnitude. The method of measuring permeability was different for the two data sets: samples from UK/Norway were measured by transient pulse decay (TPD), while the Danish samples were measured by routine core analysis. Petrological and petrophysical characterization of samples from the two data sets have revealed that all samples display a similar range of rock properties; the differences are not due to regional facies variations. It is likely that the low permeability values reported by TPD have more validity than routine core analyses in measuring lower porosity and permeability chalk (5-20% porosity, \textless0.01 mD). The fact that large sections of North Sea chalk potentially have much lower permeability than previously reported has widespread implications for petroleum migration and entrapment, and overpressure generation.},

However, heat flow data in the southern rift cannot be explained simply in terms of extension.

abstract = {Numerical models that solve governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport are commonly applied to analyze quantitatively the effects of heterogeneity. These models require maps of spatially variable hydraulic properties. Because complete three-dimensional information about hydraulic properties is never obtainable, numerous methods have been developed to interpolate between data values and use geologic, hydrogeologic, and geophysical information to create images of aquifer properties. Image creation approaches fall into three general categories: structure-imitating, process-imitating, and descriptive. Structure-imitating methods rely on one or more of the following to constrain the geometry of spatial patterns in geologic media: correlated random fields, probabilistic rules, and deterministic constraints developed from facies relations. Structure-imitating methods include spatial statistical algorithms and geologically based sedimentation pattern-matching approaches. Process-imitating models include aquifer model calibration methods and geologic process models. Aquifer model calibration methods use governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport to relate hydraulic properties to heads and solute information through history and steady state data matching. Geologic process models combine fundamental laws of conservation of mass and momentum with sediment transport equations to simulate spatial patterns in grain size distributions. At the sedimentary basin scale, multiprocess models include thermomechanical mechanisms of basin subsidence. Descriptive methods couple geologic observations with facies relations to divide an aquifer into zones of characteristic hydraulic properties. All approaches are capable of reproducing heterogeneity over a range of scales and considering some types of geologic information. Some approaches are strictly spatial while some are linked to the time evolution of sedimentation. Some approaches can be conditioned on measurements. Recent advances aimed at infusing geologic information into images of the subsurface include extracting more information from sedimentological facies models, incorporating qualitative geologic information into random field generators and simulating depositional processes. Classes of research missing from the literature include multiprocess models that incorporate diagenesis and three-dimensional surface water flow, hybrid methods that combine features of existing approaches, and approaches that can make use of all available geologic, geophysical, and hydrologic data.},

abstract = {Compaction and fluid flow in sedimentary basins are usually modelled as mechanical compaction assuming that the main driving force is the effective stress. However, in the deeper part of sedimentary basins (> 2–3 km, 70–100°C), compaction also involves dissolution and precipitation of minerals, and these processes are strongly controlled by temperature and to a lesser extent by variations in effective stress. The total pore-water flux is relatively independent of the permeability and pressure gradients because it is controlled by the rate of compaction. The main effect of permeability variations is the focusing of the compaction-driven flow. Fluids are also released by petroleum generation and dehydration of clay minerals; both these processes are also essentially temperature dependent. If the minimum permeability in one sedimentary layer (seal) falls below a critical value and there is little lateral drainage, the pressure will build up to fracture pressure. Pore pressures and fluid flow cannot be calculated from the matrix permeability of the rock when fracture pressures are reached, because much of the flow occurs along the generated fractures. The permeability produced by fracturing is a dynamic variable adjusting itself to the flux; it is not a rock property like the intergranular permeability. The intergranular permeability of shale samples before fracturing is also difficult to measure reliably in the laboratory as a result of unloading. This makes pressure prediction using one-dimensional pressure modelling uncertain. The prediction of permeability distributions in three dimensions is much more difficult.},

We investigated topographic evolution in the archetypal glacial landscape of Fiordland, New Zealand, using (U-Th)/He thermochronometry. We find that erosion during the past 2 million years removed the entire pre-Pleistocene landscape and fundamentally reshaped the topography. Erosion focused on steep valley segments and propagated from trunk valleys toward the heads of drainage basins, a behavior expected if subglacial erosion rate depends on ice sliding velocity. The Fiordland landscape illustrates complex effects of climate on Earth's surface morphology.},

abstract = {A variety of geological, hydrochemical and isotopic techniques were applied to explain the origin of exceptionally high radon levels in the St.Placidus spring near the city of Disentis in the Swiss Alps, where an average of 650 Bq/(LRn)-Rn-222 was measured. Rn-222 is a radioactive noble gas with a half-life of 4 days, which results from the disintegration of radium (Ra-226). The high radon levels can neither be explained by generally increased radium content in the fractured aquifer rock (orthogneiss), nor by the radium concentration in the spring water. It was possible to show that there must be a productive radium reservoir inside the aquifer but very near to the spring. This reservoir mainly consists of iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides, which precipitate in a zone where reduced, iron-rich groundwaters mix occasionally with oxygen-rich, freshly infiltrated rainwater or meltwater. The iron, as well as the reduced and slightly acid conditions, can be attributed to pyrite oxidation in the recharge area of the spring. Radium cations strongly adsorb and accumulate on such deposits, and generate radon, which is then quickly transported to the spring with the flowing groundwater.},

abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology is based on progressive resetting of (U-Th)/He ages by heating, with total loss of helium occurring at temperatures around 80 to 90°C (over geological timescales). Using this technique, Thermal History Reconstructions derived from AFTA and vitrinite reflectance can be further refined, allowing improved precision on the timing information of paleo-thermal events at relatively low temperatures (\textless80°C). Published apatite (U-Th)/He ages from Otway Basin wells have been interpreted by other workers as suggesting inconsistencies between measured data and thermal histories derived from AFTA. However, the thermal histories used in those studies were not sufficiently well-defined to provide a meaningful comparison. In this study, detailed thermal history reconstructions in seven wells, based on new AFTA data combined with vitrinite reflectance data, provide a more rigorous framework. Results show excellent agreement between predicted and measured ages. As well as demonstrating that helium diffusion behaviour in laboratory conditions can be extrapolated to geological conditions with confidence, these results confirm that many parts of the Otway Basin have undergone Late Tertiary exhumation, beginning at \textasciitilde10 Ma. This is highly consistent with the recognition of a major Late Miocene unconformity across SE Australia, with a recent synthesis of geological evidence suggesting that this represents a major erosional episode. The improved definition of the timing and magnitude of paleo-thermal episodes provided by this integrated approach results in enhanced definition of areas where timing of oil generation post-dates formation of structures, resulting in more efficient exploration. Results from the Otway Basin illustrate this point well.},

Present-day background must now include diffuse sources of such as disruption of soils and oxidation of organic matter, and atmospheric inputs from products of combustion and evaporation of ammonia from fertilizer and livestock waste. Anomalies can be defined as derived from nitrogen (N) inputs to the environment from anthropogenic activities, including synthetic fertilizers, livestock waste, and septic effluent. Cumulative probability graphs were used to identify threshold concentrations separating background and anomalous NO3-N concentrations and to assist in the determination of sources of N contamination for 232 spring water samples and 200 well water samples from karst aquifers. Thresholds were 0.4, 2.5, and 6.7 mg/L for spring water samples, and 0.1, 2.1, and 17 mg/L for well water samples. The 0.4 and 0.1 mg/L values are assumed to represent thresholds for present-day precipitation. Thresholds at 2.5 and 2.1 mg/L are interpreted to represent present-day background concentrations of NO3-N. The population of spring water samples with concentrations between 2.5 and 6.7 mg/L represents an amalgam of all sources of in the ground water basins that feed each spring; concentrations >6.7 mg/L were typically samples collected soon after springtime application of synthetic fertilizer.

abstract = {The theory of the fission-track method and its application to sedimentary basin analysis is illustrated by a case study in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California. Fission tracks provide a powerful tool for studying the thermal history of sedimentary basins because the two minerals most commonly used in fission-track studies, apatite and zircon, occur as detrital constituents in many sedimentary rocks, and their annealing temperatures span the main temperature range for oil generation. Fission tracks also provide information on the sedimentation record and provenance of rocks in a basin. We have used fission-track analysis to study the thermal and depositional history of the subsurface Tertiary sedimentary rocks on both sides of the active White Wolf reverse fault in the southern San Joaquin Valley. The distinctly different thermal histories of the rocks in the two structural blocks are clearly reflected in the apatite fission-track data, which suggest that rocks in the rapidly subsiding basin northwest of the fault have been near their present temperature for only about 1 m.y. compared with about 10 m.y. for rocks southeast of the fault. These estimates of heating time agree with previous estimates for these rocks. Zircon fission-track data indicate that the Tertiary sediments were derived from parent rocks of more than one age. However, from at least the Eocene to late Miocene or Pliocene, the major sediment source was rocks related to the youngest Sierra Nevada Mesozoic intrusive complexes, which are presently exposed east and south of the southern San Joaquin Valley.},

This observation is in general agreement with predictions based on the comparison of kinetic models for annealing of fission tracks in apatite and the evolution of vitrinite reflectance.

Temperature measurements can be analyzed for recharge and discharge rates, the effects of surface warming, interchange with surface water, hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments, and basin-scale permeability. Temperature data are also used in formal solutions of the inverse problem to estimate ground water flow and hydraulic conductivity. The fundamentals of using heat as a ground water tracer were published in the 1960s, but recent work has significantly expanded the application to a variety of hydrogeological settings. In recent work, temperature is used to delineate flows in the hyporheic zone, estimate submarine ground water discharge and depth to the salt-water interface, and in parameter estimation with coupled ground water and heat-flow models. While short reviews of selected work on heat as a ground water tracer can be found in a number of research papers, there is no critical synthesis of the larger body of work found in the hydrogeological literature. The purpose of this review paper is to fill that void and to show that ground water temperature data and associated analytical tools are currently underused and have not yet realized their full potential.},

abstract = {The roughness of fault surfaces is important in the mechanics of fault slip and could play a role in determining whether sliding occurs via earthquakes or fault creep. We have made preliminary measurements of the power spectral density of several fault surfaces over the wavelength range from 10&#8722;5 to 1 m, using field and laboratory scale profilimeters. The fault surfaces are strongly anisotropic; profiles parallel to the slip direction have amplitudes about one order of magnitude lower than those perpendicular to the slip direction over most of the wavelength interval measured. Fault roughness perpendicular to the slip direction is similar to the roughness of natural joints; the greater smoothness in the slip direction presumably represents wear resulting from slip. Combining our data with previous measurements of the roughness spectrum of the San Andreas fault shows that fault surfaces are fractal over nearly eleven orders of magnitude in wavelength. },

@article{Choudhury1988,
abstract = {The model is an explicit solution of the equations which define the conservation of heat and water vapour in the system consisting of uniform vegetation and soil. The vegetation has two layers, the first extending from a reference height in the atmosphere to the virtual sink for momentum and the second from the virtual sink to the soil surface. Soil between the surface and the damping depth is divided into an upper, completely dry layer and a lower wet layer. Throughout the system, differences of potential per unit flux are specified by resistances, notably the conventional surface resistance governing the loss of vapour from foliage and a new soil resistance, assumed proportional to the accumulated loss of water by evaporation from the soil surface, which is proportional to the square root of elapsed time. Since the total energy available to the system is limited by absorption of radiation, the increase of transpiration from foliage as it expands decreases evaporation from the soil. Conversely, as soil dries, transpiration rate per unit of foliage area increases. This interaction of vapour fluxes is governed by the behaviour of the saturation vapour pressure deficit within the vegetation, identified as a major variable. General implications of the model are consistent with observations and estimates of evaporation rate from a stand of wheat grown in Arizona agree well with measurements from lysimeters. The model is applicable to a wide range of problems in agricultural meteorology and hydrology. With simplification, it could be used to obtain surface exchanges of sensible and latent heat in atmospheric general circulation models.},

abstract = {We present a revised estimate of Earth's surface heat flux that is based upon a heat flow data-set with 38 347 measurements, which is 55% more than used in previous estimates. Our methodology, like others, accounts for hydrothermal circulation in young oceanic crust by utilising a half-space cooling approximation. For the rest of Earth's surface, we estimate the average heat flow for different geologic domains as defined by global digital geology maps; and then produce the global estimate by multiplying it by the total global area of that geologic domain. The averaging is done on a polygon set which results from an intersection of a 1 degree equal area grid with the original geology polygons; this minimises the adverse influence of clustering. These operations and estimates are derived accurately using methodologies from Geographical Information Science. We consider the virtually un-sampled Antarctica separately and also make a small correction for hot-spots in young oceanic lithosphere. A range of analyses is presented. These, combined with statistical estimates of the error, provide a measure of robustness. Our final preferred estimate is 47±2 TW, which is greater than previous estimates.},

abstract = {Fluid flow patterns due to free thermal convection in permeable rock masses have been investigated for the 3D geological architecture around the Mount Isa lead-zinc-silver and copper deposits. Key results for the range of parameters explored here are: (1) Flow pattern and temperature distribution in stratigraphic units with homogeneous permeability are similar to those in units with the same average permeability in a heterogeneous distribution. (2) The geometry of one highly permeable stratigraphic unit governs fluid flow to an extent where it spatially attracts a convection cell, irrespective of the volume of adjacent permeable units. (3) Even in a complex and heterogeneous system with patches of low permeability along the fluid pathways, the Rayleigh number can be used to determine whether free convection will occur or not. Numerical simulations in 3D of coupled fluid flow and heat transfer were carried out using the finite difference computer code SHEMAT. Two different levels of permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Firstly, heterogeneity introduced by stratigraphy and secondly, various heterogeneous permeability distributions within geological units. Further complexity was created by defining patches with very low permeability within those stratigraphic units. The results show that free convection in hydrothermal systems is highly sensitive to the 3D permeability distribution in the geological architecture.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 1142013131 At many subduction zones, accretionary complexes form as sediments are offscraped from the subducting plate, and excess pore pressures commonly develop as low-permeability marine sediments undergo rapid tectonically driven loading. Mechanical models demonstrate that pore pressure controls the overall geometry of these systems by modifying shear strength both within the accretionary wedge and along its base. At the Nankai margin offshore SW Japan, the taper angle of the accretionary wedge varies markedly along-strike, from 223C4� along an eastern (Muroto) transect, to 8201310�along a western (Ashizuri) transect. Sediment stratigraphy on the subducting plate also varies: along the Ashizuri transect, the lowermost part of the section includes abundant sandy turbidites, whereas along the Muroto transect it is composed of monotonous hemipelagic mudstone. Here, I use a numerical model of fluid flow, together with laboratory measurements that constrain the bulk mudstone permeability, to quantitatively test the hypothesis that the turbidite-rich section along the Ashizuri transect allows drainage at the base of the accretionary complex, resulting in differences in mechanical strength sufficient to cause the differences in taper angle. My results demonstrate that if the turbidite-rich units are 22013100 times more permeable than the mudstone units, the variation in stratigraphy can indeed explain the observed taper angles. In contrast, permeability anisotropy within the turbidite-rich units has only a minor effect; anisotropy ratios of 223C1000:1 would be required to cause the differences in taper angle. Along the Ashizuri transect, simulated pore pressures result in a basal shear strength ranging from a few MPa at the trench to 223C20�MPa by 30�km arcward; along the Muroto transect shear strength is substantially lower, reaching only 223C5�MPa by 30�km. This work shows that lithostratigraphy can strongly influence the mechanical behavior of subduction zone faults, through its control on the distribution and magnitude of excess pore pressure.},

abstract = {The Otway Basin is one of a number of basins formed along Australia's southern continental margin during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting of Australia from Antarctica. It lies on a transitional area of extended lithosphere between the margin to the west, where continental separation took place close to the Australian craton, and the region to the east where separation failed to develop through Bass Strait, but instead switched to the south of Tasmania. Seven AGSO regional deep seismic profiles recorded during 1992 across onshore parts of the basin provide images of synrift basin bounding faults that dip predominantly towards the continent, basin sequences in half-graben rift segments at two-way times greater than 4 s, and mid-crustal detachments with ramp and flat geometry at mid-crustal levels. When combined with industry seismic data, trend variations on faults indicate that extensional strain direction varied along the rift system, probably locally controlled by pre-existing Palaeozoic geology but consistent with general north-south lithospheric extension. Basement highs between some of the rift segments are interpreted as accommodation (or transfer) zones. Multiple basin-bounding faults in some places mirror features within basement and may indicate a component of local strike-slip during early rifting. The syn-rift segments form part of the first-stage Early Cretaceous failed rift system in the Otway-Bass Strait region. Crustal thickness is interpreted to be 31 km (10.310.5 s TWT) near the northern basin margin, thinning to about 25 km (9 s TWT, 40% reduction in thickness of Palaeozoic crust) seaward of the Tartwaup fault zone. This fault zone, and the Timboon fault system farther east, are interpreted to be headwall faults (landward limit) of a Late Cretaceous second-stage rifting system along a lower plate margin which ultimately separated Australia from Antarctica.},

abstract = {The development of transient thermal stress in suboceanic mantle is investigated on the basis of two-dimensional thermoviscoelastic models incorporating composite rheology appropriate for dry oceanic lithosphere. Thermal stress is shown to be sufficiently high to deeply fracture the coldest part of lithosphere, e.g., to the depth of at least 30 km (and possibly down to $\sim$50 km) in 100-Ma-old lithosphere. The release of thermal stress by tension cracking is limited to the vicinity of cracks, and the cascade crack system is suggested to be required given the finite fracture strength of mantle materials. Possible physical and chemical consequences of deep thermal cracking are also discussed. The rheological evolution of oceanic lithosphere is likely to be affected by thermal cracking and subsequent serpentinization, which introduces the localized zones of weakness in the otherwise stiffest part of lithosphere. This localized weakening may help to explain why plate tectonic convection, not stagnant lid convection, operates in Earth's mantle.},

abstract = {Abstract Deformation along faults in the shallow crust (<1km) introduces permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy, which has an important impact on processes such as regional groundwater flow, hydrocarbon migration, and hydrothermal fluid circulation. Fault zones have the capacity to be hydraulic conduits connecting shallow and deep geological environments, but simultaneously the fault cores of many faults often form effective barriers to flow. The direct evaluation of the impact of faults to fluid flow patterns remains a challenge and requires a multidisciplinary research effort of structural geologists and hydrogeologists. However, we find that these disciplines often use different methods with little interaction between them. In this review, we document the current multi-disciplinary understanding of fault zone hydrogeology. We discuss surface- and subsurface observations from diverse rock types from unlithified and lithified clastic sediments through to carbonate, crystalline, and volcanic rocks. For each rock type, we evaluate geological deformation mechanisms, hydrogeologic observations and conceptual models of fault zone hydrogeology. Outcrop observations indicate that fault zones commonly have a permeability structure suggesting they should act as complex conduit–barrier systems in which along-fault flow is encouraged and across-fault flow is impeded. Hydrogeological observations of fault zones reported in the literature show a broad qualitative agreement with outcrop-based conceptual models of fault zone hydrogeology. Nevertheless, the specific impact of a particular fault permeability structure on fault zone hydrogeology can only be assessed when the hydrogeological context of the fault zone is considered and not from outcrop observations alone. To gain a more integrated, comprehensive understanding of fault zone hydrogeology, we foresee numerous synergistic opportunities and challenges for the discipline of structural geology and hydrogeology to co-evolve and address remaining challenges by co-locating study areas, sharing approaches and fusing data, developing conceptual models from hydrogeologic data, numerical modeling, and training interdisciplinary scientists.},

abstract = {The Dead Sea rift valley is a left-lateral transform, along which several rhomb-shaped grabens were formed. At the Sea of Galilee, which is one of these rhomb-shaped grabens, ambiguous heat fluxes were measured: 70&#8211;80 mW&#47;m2 at the central part of the lake, 36 mW&#47;m2 at the lake&#39;s southern coast (10 km apart), and most surprising, about 135 mW&#47;m2 at the southern Golan Heights, 6&#8211;8 km east of the graben margin. A detailed geologic cross section, traversing the entire sedimentary basin, was constructed. The hydrodynamics in this cross section were analyzed quantitatively using a two-dimensional finite element code that solves the coupled variable-density ground-water flow and conductive-convective heat transfer equations. On the basis of numerical simulations, different mechanisms of basin-scale ground-water convection are suggested for the two sides of the rift that could influence the transport of heat: (1) forced convection (gravity-driven flow) of hot brines from deeper aquifers to the land surface at the western side; and (2) large-scale free convection (buoyancy-driven flow) of deep ground water at the eastern side. The different heat fluxes within the rift valley are attributed to the different lithologies and to the locations of specific conduits through which the hot ground waters ascend from deeper horizons. These simulations also explain the different salinities of the hot springs on the two sides of the rift.},

abstract = {Natural fault damage zones (FDZs) are characterized by complex geometries and topologies, and by strongly-contrasting material properties. Accurate simulation of fluid flow in such systems is dependent on the method of discretization and the mathematical representation of the flow. In this paper, we focus on the conceptual and methodological issues that link a model of a heterogeneous system and its flow response. We study FDZs as our example, where each thin fault strand is a barrier to flow. We examine two contrasting discretization schemes and apply them to 2D FDZ models that contain a realistic array of linear fault traces. Both schemes produce results that are generally in good agreement, and agree with the results calculated by a more accurate (but computationally less efficient) reference scheme. However, differences occur when the discretization approach fails to maintain the fault connectivity (topology) of the input model. It is important to guide the modelling by identifying any continuous flow pathways in the matrix linking fluid inlets and outlets (Through-Going Regions, TGRs). We illustrate a new scheme that identifies all TGRs and determines a grid that is just fine enough to resolve them.},

abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He and fission-track thermochronometers are combined to constrain models of denudation and escarpment development of the high elevation Eritrean margin along the southern Red Sea. (U-Th)/He ages have been determined for apatites from two coast-perpendicular transects that were previously used for apatite fission-track analysis [E. Abbate, M.L. Balestrieri, G. Bigazzi, Morphostructural development of the Eritrean rift flank (southern Red Sea) inferred from apatite fission track analysis, J. Geophys. Res., 107, B11, doi: 10.1029/2001JB001009, (2002)]. In central Eritrea near Asmara, He ages increase from c. 7 Ma at the coast to 152 Ma on the plateau along a transect. Further south, He ages from the margin border to the base of the escarpment span a narrower range (7 to 12 Ma). One sample from the top of a marginal high (2950 m) yields older ages (22-43 Ma). Forward modeling suggests that the He age distribution across the margin should allow scarp retreat and downwearing mechanisms to be distinguished in the case of a margin formed in the last twenty million years. The distribution of He ages suggests that the escarpment evolved by downwearing and that post-break up erosion of the escarpment was facilitated by in situ excavation rather than parallel retreat. This implies the existence of an inland drainage divide located seaward of the present day escarpment rim. We envisage that the inland divide formed during or immediately after continent break up, and that the eastern marginal belt represents a remnant of the apex structure. The short distance between the eastern marginal belt and the rim (c. 10 km) represents the total retreat of the escarpment. Comparison of the measured He ages from the coastal plain with those predicted from forward modelling indicates that the main phase of post-break up erosion started at about 15 Ma, closer to the initiation of seafloor spreading in the Red Sea than was thought previously.},

abstract = {At subduction zones, fluid flow, pore pressure, and tectonic processes are tightly interconnected. Excess pore pressure is driven by tectonic loading and fluids released by mineral dehydration, and it has profound effects on fault and earthquake mechanics through its control on effective stress. The egress of these overpressured fluids, which is in part governed by the presence of permeable fault zones, is a primary mechanism of volatile and solute transport to the oceans. Recent field measurements, new constraints gained from laboratory studies, and numerical modeling efforts have led to a greatly improved understanding of these coupled processes. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of fluid flow and pore pressure in subduction forearcs, and focus on recent advances that have quantified permeability architecture, fluxes, the nature and timing of transience, and pressure distribution, thus providing new insights into the connections between fluid, metamorphic, mechanical, and fault slip proc...},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing, used to economically produce natural gas from shale formations, has raised environmental concerns. The objective of this study is to assess one of the largely unexamined issues, which is the potential for slow contamination of shallow groundwater due to hydraulic fracturing at depth via fluid migration along conductive faults. We compiled publically available data of shale gas basins and hydraulic fracturing operations to develop a two-dimensional, single-phase, multispecies, density-dependent, finite-element numerical groundwater flow and mass transport model. The model simulates hydraulic fracturing in the vicinity of a permeable fault zone in a generic, low-recharge, regional sedimentary basin in which shallow, active groundwater flow occurs above nearly stagnant brine. A sensitivity analysis of contaminant migration along the fault considered basin, fault and hydraulic fracturing parameters. Results show that specific conditions are needed for the slow contamination of a shallow aquifer: a high permeability fault, high overpressure in the shale unit, and hydrofracturing in the upper portion of the shale near the fault. Under such conditions, contaminants from the shale unit reach the shallow aquifer in less than 1000 years following hydraulic fracturing, at concentrations of solutes up to 90% of their initial concentration in the shale, indicating that the impact on groundwater quality could be significant. Important implications of this result are that hydraulic fracturing should not be carried out near potentially conductive faults, and that impacts should be monitored for long timespans. Further work is needed to assess the impact of multiphase flow on contaminant transport along natural preferential pathways.},

abstract = {Chlorine in the Earth is highly depleted relative to carbonaceous
chondrites and solar abundances(1). Knowledge of the Cl concentrations
and distribution on Earth is essential for understanding the origin of
these depletions. Large differences in the stable chlorine isotope
ratios of meteoritic, mantle and crustal materials have been used as
evidence for distinct reservoirs in the solar nebula(2) and to
calculate the relative proportions of Cl in the mantle and crust(3).
Here we report that large isotopic differences do not exist, and that
carbonaceous chondrites, mantle and crust all have the same Cl-37/Cl-35
ratios. We have further analysed crustal sediments from the early
Archaean era to the Recent epoch and find no systematic isotopic
variations with age, demonstrating that the mantle and crust have
always had the same delta Cl-37 value. The similarity of mantle, crust
and carbonaceous chondrites establishes that there were no nebular
reservoirs with distinct isotopic compositions, no isotopic
fractionation during differentiation of the Earth and no late
(post-core formation) Cl-bearing volatile additions to the crustal
veneer with a unique isotopic composition.},

abstract = {The North Sea is a major continental basin filled with early Paleozoic to Recent sediments. Though graben formation started in the Triassic, the last major period of extension occurred between the Middle Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous. Following the faulting and graben formation associated with this extension, subsidence within the central North Sea was widespread and uniform and has created a saucer-shaped sedimentary basin. This was filled successively by chalks, sandstones, and finally, during most of the Tertiary, by shales and mud-stones. We examined the subsidence of six wells down the middle and two on the flanks of the Central Graben. In the period of widespread steady subsidence the water-loaded basement depth in the middle increased by 1100-1400 m. On the flanks the basement subsided 600-700 m. We suggest that most of this subsidence results from the thermal relaxation of the lithosphere which was thinned during a Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous stretching of the crust. Assuming a crustal stretching and associated lithospheric thinning of between 50 and 100% in the middle and decreasing on either side, we obtained a good match to the observed amplitude and rate of subsidence. The Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous subsidence which is found within the graben proper we relate to the fault-controlled initial subsidence which occurred during the actual stretching. The measurd heat flow is compatible with such a stretching model. Though there is no seismic refraction data across the Central Graben, this model is strongly supported by evidence of a thinner crust under the Viking Graben to the north and the Witchground/Buchan Graben complex to the east. Using the above observations as the basis for a geological interpretation, we examined the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon potential of certain sedimentary horizons in the northern section of the Central Graben. In analyzing the various wells we extended previous work on the compaction correction to handle overpressuring and mixed lithologies in backstripping studies. Further, we expanded these methods to include the variation of thermal conductivity, and calculations of the degree of thermal maturation of the deposited sediments, through time.},

abstract = {Annealing rates for fission tracks in apatite vary markedly as a complex function of composition, based on an experimental study of 15 well-characterized, compositionally diverse apatites. Extensive annealing data were obtained in 69 experiments (durations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 h at temperatures from 75 to 400 °C) on each of four apatites, three with near end-member occupancy of the halogen site by F, Cl, and OH, plus the well-known apatite from Durango, Mexico. These results were supplemented by less-comprehensive annealing data from 12 experiments over the same range of time and temperature on each of the remaining 11 apatites. Measurements of initial fission-track length, a parameter of considerable importance to the derivation of time-temperature paths from fission-track data, reveal substantial variations from one apatite to another; initial lengths are best predicted from etch figures. Interlaboratory comparisons of data on annealing kinetics highlight discrepancies that appear to result largely from differences in the precision and accuracy of experimental temperatures. None of the factors previously proposed as the dominant compositional controls on annealing rates can account completely for annealing behavior over the full range of compositions studied. Nevertheless, relative rates of annealing among all apatites are highly systematic, which allows this data set to be used in its entirety to constrain multikinetic annealing models that predict fission-track lengths as a function of time and temperature.},

abstract = {Detailed investigations of the temperature distribution in the Rhine Graben indicate a regular pattern of graben-parallel thermal anomalies following major north-south striking faults. These faults, which might imply north-south convection pattern due to higher permeability, have been ignored in conventional models based on 2D east-west striking sections. The present study investigates small-scale temperature anomalies in the Rhine Graben, focusing on its north-south striking major faults and their important permeability structures. Analytical solutions for convective flow in vertical faults were applied to a clearly observable anomalous temperature pattern. Through these calculations the fault geometry, minimal fault permeability and time to convective onset were derived from observed distances between anomalies. Since analytical solutions are limited to simple model geometries, further improvement was achieved through numerical model simulations, which allow the assumption of more complex initial and boundary conditions. Using the finite volume code TOUGH2 we investigated in detail the convective fluid flow pattern along the [Gamma]-fault in the Landau region through a 3D model. There, regions of alternatively higher and lower temperatures follow each other at an average distance of 1800 m. Focusing on the predominant north-south permeability structure, our model consists of a vertical north-south striking fault and surrounding matrix with fault geometries based on analytical predictions. The observed temperature could be explained by a numerical model indicating fluid velocities in the fault of 10-9 m s-1 and an anomaly whose minimal age is 77,000 years. The study proves that the observed small-scale graben-parallel temperature anomalies can be explained only by convection systems within north-south striking fault zones. The regional flow regime is therefore significantly influenced by the convective fluid flux in major north-south striking faults. Investigations of temperature anomalies in the Rhine Graben must take into account this north-south flow. Since the presented results correlate with findings from other geothermal anomalies in the Rhine Graben such as the one at Soultz, we suspect this to be a general feature of the major north-south striking faults there. Moreover, since in most grabenlike structures thermal anomalies are associated with the Graben master faults, the present study may provide common clues for investigating other graben-parallel temperature anomalies.},

@article{Plenefisch1997,
abstract = {Altogether 98 focal mechanisms of micro to moderate earthquakes (ML = 0.5-5.9) have been used to analyze the state of stress in the Rhine Graben and adjacent areas. Due to dense networks in the investigated area fault plane solutions determined by the first motion method can be fixed with an accuracy better than 10[degree sign]. The majority of the focal mechanisms is characterized by strike-slip and normal faulting movements; only a few events are of reverse faulting type. To calculate the orientations of the principal stress axes and the shape of the stress tensor we applied the inversion method of Gephart and Forsyth (1984) to three subsets of the data, each of which has been chosen taking into account the local tectonic units (northern Alpine foreland, southern Rhine Graben, northern Rhine Graben including Rhenish Massif and lower Rhine Embayment). For all of the data subsets, the inversions revealed a stable axis of minimum principal stress [sigma]3, oriented horizontally to subhorizontally and striking in a WSW-ENE to SW-NE direction. The azimuth of [sigma]1, the maximum principal stress, is about 150[degree sign]. However, the confidence regions show that horizontal and vertical orientations of [sigma]1, as well as orientations in between, are of the same probability. Therefore, an unequivocal distinction between strike-slip and extensional regimes is not possible. When comparing the results from the data subsets, a slight counterclockwise rotation from south to north of about 30[degree sign] of the [sigma]1-[sigma]2 plane plane as well as of the direction of [sigma]3, can be observed. The relative stress magnitude R (R = ([sigma]2 - [sigma]1)/([sigma]3 - [sigma]1)) has a value of about 0.5 for all subsets, indicating that for the deviatoric part of the stress tensor, [sigma]1 and [sigma]3 are of the same magnitude but of opposite sign. The directions of the horizontal stresses, SHmax and Shmin, inferred from the analysis of focal mechanisms are in good agreement with the general features for western Europe in the European Stress Map. More detailed investigations have been performed for the southern Rhine Graben area. A division into an upper crustal (\textless15 km) and a lower crustal (\textgreater15 km) dataset makes possible the resolution of an individual stress regime for each subset: a strike-slip regime for the upper and an extensional regime for the lower crust, with the same azimuths of the principal stress axes for both depth ranges. Such a change of the stress tensor with depth fits into the tectonic model of detachment zones in the lower crust in the northern front of the Alps, a detachment caused by south-plunging subduction of the European plate beneath the Alps and the Adriatic plate. On the basis of the resolved orientations of the principal stress axes and the shape of the stress tensor, we furthermore estimated absolute stress magnitudes and the ranges of frictional parameters acting on the individual faults. Assuming hydrostatic pore pressure on the faults, frictional coefficients between 0.10 and 0.64 are required to enable slip. On the other hand, when the frictional coefficient has been fixed to 0.65, the required pore pressure values range from 0.38 to 0.62 of lithostatic with an average of 0.48. The absolute stress magnitudes inferred from the analysis of the focal mechanisms compare favourably with the in-situ measurements of absolute stresses from the KTB borehole at Windischeschenbach (German continental deep drilling program).},

abstract = {PECUBE is a three-dimensional thermal–kinematic code capable of solving the heat production–diffusion–advection equation under a temporally varying surface boundary condition. It was initially developed to assess the effects of time-varying surface topography (relief) on low-temperature thermochronological datasets. Thermochronometric ages are predicted by tracking the time–temperature histories of rock-particles ending up at the surface and by combining these with various age-prediction models. In the decade since its inception, the \{PECUBE\} code has been under continuous development as its use became wider and addressed different tectonic–geomorphic problems. This paper describes several major recent improvements in the code, including its integration with an inverse-modeling package based on the Neighborhood Algorithm, the incorporation of fault-controlled kinematics, several different ways to address topographic and drainage change through time, the ability to predict subsurface (tunnel or borehole) data, prediction of detrital thermochronology data and a method to compare these with observations, and the coupling with landscape-evolution (or surface-process) models. Each new development is described together with one or several applications, so that the reader and potential user can clearly assess and make use of the capabilities of PECUBE. We end with describing some developments that are currently underway or should take place in the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {Fault-related host rock deformation and dilation control fluid flow and mineralization in many world-class mineral deposits. This numerical modelling study explores the interactions between deformation, faulting, dilation, fluid flow and chemical processes, which are suggested to result in this control, with special attention to fault dilatant jog structures. Our two-dimensional numerical models focus on faulting-related deformation, dilation and permeability enhancement, fluid flow patterns and fluid focusing/mixing locations, while three-dimensional models examine several different cases of fault underlap and overlap. The results show that fault-dilation and faulting-induced permeability enhancement, which are closely associated with tensile failure, represent important ways to generate fluid flow conduits for more effective fluid flow and mixing. Dilation during strike–slip faulting is localized near fault tips (wing crack locations) and jog sites, where fluids are strongly focused and mixed. These locations are the tensile domains of the strike–slip regime. In overlapping-fault (dilatant jog) cases, the magnitude of dilation and the extent of the dilatant region are closely related to the extent of fault overlap. These results provide insight into the transport of fluids through low-permeability rocks with isolated, but more permeable, faults. Gold and quartz precipitation patterns as a result of the coupling of chemical reactions to deformation induced fluid flow velocities are also computed. The rates of precipitation depend on structural and fluid flow conditions and on the geometrical relation between local fluid velocity and chemical concentration gradients generated by mixing. Maximum precipitation rates for gold occur in the dilation zones and in faults where high fluid flow rates, sufficient fluid mixing and high concentration gradients of critical chemical species are all present, while the quartz precipitation rate is predominantly controlled, in this iso- thermal situation, by the rate of fluid flow across concentration gradients in the aqueous silica concentration.},

@article{Haywood2000,
abstract = {The paleoclimate of the middle Pliocene (ca. 3 Ma) was generally warmer than present, particularly at middle to high latitudes. It has been suggested that this period may represent an analogue for future climate change. Mechanisms that have been proposed to account for this warming are enhanced thermohaline circulation and/or greater concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. We present new climate model simulations, supported by geological data that suggest that in the European and Mediterranean region the climate was warmer (by 5 degreesC), wetter (by 400-1000 mm/yr), and less seasonal than present. Modeling results suggest that an intensification of the Icelandic low-pressure system and the Azores high-pressure system occurred during the middle Pliocene as a direct result of higher annual sea-surface temperatures and reduced ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere. This change increased the surface pressure gradient over the region and strengthened annual westerly wind velocity by 4 m/s-1. Associated increases in wind stress (by 20 N/m-2) over the North Atlantic Ocean may have enhanced the flow of surface currents such as the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current, which in turn would have sustained the higher sea-surface temperatures. These changes to the regional climate system would have driven greater atmospheric and oceanic transport of heat from equatorial regions to the North Atlantic Ocean, particularly during winter. Such conditions are proposed as a likely cause of the warming indicated for Europe and the Mediterranean ca. 3 Ma.},

abstract = {Abstract The western Lower Saxony Basin is characterized by magnetic and gravity anomalies and an unusually strong coalification of surface-near sedimentary rocks, indicating that high temperatures were reached in the past. The temperature history of the basin has been disputed for many years leading basically to two different hypotheses: one proposes igneous intrusion during Mid Cretaceous time, causing the high maturity in this area, whereas the other theory explained the coalification as a result of deep burial during late Jurassic and early Cretaceous times. Petrographical data are summarized which show the maturity distribution within the basin, reflecting maximum palaeotemperature conditions. This maturity distribution is visualized along three cross sections of up to 50 km length, as well as the palaeotemperature distribution for six time steps. Furthermore, geochemical data on petroleum source rocks are presented which indicate early mature/immature type I/II kerogen in Wealden and Posidonia Shales and mature/overmature type III kerogen in the coal-bearing Upper Carboniferous. Fluid inclusion compositions in quartz crystals are highly variable ranging from liquid to gaseous, and gas compositions are also variable. These data were interpreted in the context of burial history. This study provides new data and numerical models with the intention to clarify the cause of the high coalification in the basin. 2D structural and basin modelling along three cross sections, combined with new fluid inclusion measurements and results of previous coalification studies, 1D modelling, and fission track dating demonstrate high heat flow during the Late Jurassic extension stage followed by a deep burial of the basin during the Early Cretaceous, associated with only moderate heat flows. The presence of an igneous intrusion of Cretaceous age is not supported. Furthermore, timing of hydrocarbon generation from the three major source rocks is discussed.},

On the basis of 228Ra and 226Ra mass-balance models, we estimated the advective flux of 226Ra through SGD to be ∼270×1012 dpm yr−1 in the Yellow Sea. Using this 226Ra flux and the measured 226Ra activity in coastal groundwater, the submarine discharge of groundwater (mostly brackish groundwater) was calculated to be at least 40% of the river-water input (∼2.3×1011 m3 yr−1). Then, on the basis of the SGD and the concentration of Si in coastal groundwater, we estimated the flux of Si through SGD to be 20–100% of that associated with river discharge (∼23×109 mol yr−1). This large SGD is likely to be due to the high tidal range (up to 10 m) and the wide distribution of sandy sediments in the Yellow Sea, favorable for the recirculation of seawater through bottom sediments and rocks. This result from such a large area implies that the Si flux through SGD may be significant on a global scale.},

abstract = {Heat flow in active tectonic zones as the Baikal rift is a crucial parameter for evaluating deep anomalous structures and lithosphere evolution. Based on the interpretation of the existing datasets, the Baikal rift has been characterized in the past by either high heat flow, or moderately elevated heat flow, or even lacking a surface heat flow anomaly. We made an attempt to better constrain the geothermal picture by a detailed offshore contouring survey of known anomalies, and to estimate the importance of observed heat flow anomalies within the regional surface heat output. A total of about 200 new and close-spaced heat flow measurements were obtained in several selected study areas in the North Baikal Basin. With an outrigged and a violin-bow designed thermoprobe of 2-3-m length, both the sediment temperature and thermal conductivity were measured. The new data show at all investigated sites that the large heat flow highs are limited to local heat flow anomalies. The maximum measured heat flow reaches values of 300-35000 mW/m2, but the extent of the anomalies is not larger than 2 to 4 km in diameter. Aside of these local anomalies, heat flow variations are restricted to near background values of 50-70 mW/m2, except in the uplifted Academician zone. The extent of the local anomalies excludes a conductive source, and therefore heat transport by fluids must be considered. In a conceptual model where all bottom floor heat flow anomalies are the result of upflowing fluids along a conduit, an extra heat output of 20 MW (including advection) is estimated for all known anomalies in the North Baikal Basin. Relative to a basal heat flow of 55-65 mW/m2, these estimations suggest an extra heat output in the northern Lake Baikal of only 5%, corresponding to a regional heat flow increase of 3 mW/m2. The source of this heat can be fully attributed to a regional heat redistribution by topographically driven ground water flow. Thus, the surface heat flow is not expected to bear a signal of deeper lithospheric thermal anomalies that can be separated from heat flow typical for orogenically altered crust (40-70 mW/m2). The new insights on the geothermal signature in the Baikal rift once more show that continental rifting is not by default characterized by high heat flow.},

abstract = {In the western Eger Rift (ER) area along the Po{\v{c}}atky–Plesn{\'{a}} fault zone (PPZ) CO2 degassing occurs predominantly within two mofette fields Bubl{\'{a}}k and Hartou{\v{s}}ov. We studied 27 wet mofettes belonging to these mofette fields for gas emission rates repeatedly between 2007 and 2009 and selected mofettes for gas composition and isotope ratios ($\delta$13C, 3He/4He). Detailed ground mapping along the PPZ provided further two separated diffuse degassing structures (DDS) within the mofette fields Hartou{\v{s}}ov and Bubl{\'{a}}k. The DDS Hartou{\v{s}}ov was studied in detail by measurements of 682 CO2 soil gas concentrations, 762 CO2 soil gas fluxes (max. 10 grid spacing) and partly by analyses of isotope ratios (13C/12C, 3He/4He) of soil gas. At the DDS Hartou{\v{s}}ov the total CO2 soil flux yielded 1.559 t m− 2 d− 1 in spring 2009 and the CO2 emission rate at the wet mofettes of Hartou{\v{s}}ov mofette field yielded 0.62 t d− 1. The total CO2 discharge of the 27 wet mofettes was 3.75 t d− 1.  At sites with high CO2 soil flux, the portion of mantle-derived helium is in the same range as the releasing at wet mofettes; both cover the signature of the subcontinental mantle. Also, the $\delta$13C values analysed in the gas releasing from wet mofettes and those analysed in soil gas are nearly the same. Taking in account a biogenic soil CO2 flux of 25 g m− 2 d− 1 as background, the mantle-derived CO2 flux yielded approximately 1566 t m− 2 d− 1. As a result of the CO2 flux mapping of the DDS Hartou{\v{s}}ov, it could be proved that 97.4% of the released soil CO2 (1.518 t m− 2 d− 1) stems from sites with CO2 fluxes higher than 500 g m− 2 d− 1‐pointing to dominantly fault-related CO2 release.  At the central mofette Bubl{\'{a}}k (B2), the gas emission rate was determined for the first time in 1993. Measurements repeated between 2007 and 2009 showed a clear increase in the gas emission rate of more than 40%, correlating well with the increase of the 3He/4He ratios from 5 Ra to approximately 6 Ra between 1993 and 2008 at this location (Br{\"{a}}uer et al., 2009).  The Bubl{\'{a}}k mofette field is characterised by the highest CO2 emission rate along the PPZ, and in combination with the helium isotope signature of the European subcontinental mantle, this area was identified as a deep-reaching fluid injection zone.},

abstract = {The whole Earth geohydrologic cycle describes the occurrence and movement of water from the clouds to the core. Reservoirs that comprise the conventional hydrologic cycle define the exosphere, whereas those reservoirs that are part of the solid Earth represent the geosphere. Exosphere reservoirs thus include the atmosphere, the oceans, surface water, glaciers and polar ice, the biosphere, and groundwater. Continental crust, oceanic crust, upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and the core make up the geosphere. The exosphere and geosphere are linked through the active plate tectonic processes of subduction and volcanism.\nWhile the storage capacities of reservoirs in the geosphere have been reasonably well constrained by experimental and observational studies, much uncertainty exists concerning the actual amount of water held in the geosphere. Assuming that the amount of water in the upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle represents only 10%, 10%, and 50% of their storage capacities, respectively, the total amount of water in the Earth's mantle (1.2 × 1021 kg) is comparable to the amount of water held in the world's oceans (1.37 × 1021 kg).\nFluxes between reservoirs in the geohydrologic cycle vary by $\sim$7 orders of magnitude, and range from 4.25 × 1017 kg/yr between the oceans and atmosphere, to 5 × 1010 kg/yr between the lower mantle and transition zone. Residence times for water in the various reservoirs of the geohydrologic cycle also show wide variation, and range from 2.6 × 10-2 yr ($\sim$10 days) for water in the atmosphere, to 6.6 × 109 yr for water in the transition zone.},

annote = {The relationship between reduced track density, [varrho]/[varrho]0, and reduced mean confined track length, L/L0, during annealing has been studied for both spontaneous and induced tracks in four apatite samples with different chemical composition, compositional range, and origin, and with spontaneous tracks giving mean confined track lengths varying from \textasciitilde 14.5 [mu]m down to 12.3 [mu]m. In all four apatites, induced tracks show a relationship between L/L0 and [varrho]/[varrho]0 composed of two regions; at higher values the two appear to be equal, while at lower values L/L0 is greater than [varrho]/[varrho]0. This can be understood qualitatively in terms of the anisotropy of annealing and the bias against revelation of short tracks. Data from three apatites of uniform composition show near-identical relationships. In a sample showing a range of apatite compositions, the point of divergence from the 1:1 relationship is somewhat higher than in the uniform composition apatites, because individual grains anneal at different rates, and the presence of highly annealed grains affects the track density more strongly than the mean track length. Spontaneous tracks show similar relationships to those observed for induced tracks in each sample, when the data are renormalised to allow for the natural annealing present in the spontaneous tracks. Previous studies which led to the idea of length reduction without density reduction for spontaneous tracks did not renormalise density data as well as length data, thereby distorting the apparent relationship. Data for the multi-compositional apatite sample where annealing has taken place in geological conditions also agrees with the laboratory annealing data for both spontaneous and induced tracks. This consistency suggests that a single process is responsible in all three cases, implying that a laboratory-based description of annealing can be applied to geological conditions with confidence. Recognition that spontaneous tracks in apatite are commonly annealed suggests that, in general, the fission track age should be interpreted as a reflection of both the time over which tracks have been retained and the distribution of etchable track lengths. Since the latter is a manifestation of the thermal history, the fission track age should be interpreted in similar terms.},

abstract = {The Tertiary development of the Norwegian continental margin was dominated by the opening of the Arctic-North Atlantic Ocean. The correct identification of magnetic anomalies and their ages and the analysis of spreading rates during the formation of this ocean are important in understanding the development of the region and specifically the history of its passive margins. Three ocean domains, the Aegir, Reykjanes and Mohns regions, were investigated in an effort to understand the lateral changes in structural development of the passive margin after continental break-up. Spreading rates generally slowed down from 2 cm a-1 after Early Eocene initiation of sea-floor spreading, to values around 0.5 cm a-1 in Oligocene time. An increase in spreading rates to around 1 cm a-1 coincided with the positioning of the Iceland hotspot under the North Atlantic mid-ocean ridge. At the same time, the European plate changed its absolute plate motion from a north-directed drift to a motion more towards the east. The location of inversion structures in the Voring and Faeroes Basin rather than in the More Basin is related to differences in spreading rates. The Mohns and the Reykjanes Ridges produced more ocean floor than the Aegir-Kolbeinsey Ridges. Asymmetric ocean-floor formation in the Aegir Ridge led to differential stress at the base of the lithosphere, which probably explains the absence of inversion features in the More Basin (less mantle drag). Furthermore, upper plate margins such as the Voring Basin and possibly the Faeroe Basin have a lower compressional strength than lower plate margins such as the More Basin, and therefore preferentially developed inversion structures. Along the transform boundaries separating the domains, additional stress probably built up along extension of the transform zones into the extended continental crust. This additional stress probably also assisted initiation of the inversion structures in the Voring Basin and the Faeroes area. The amplification of the inversion structures in the Voring Basin and the Faeroes Basin was subsequently caused by a variety of processes related to sedimentation and uplift-erosion.},

abstract = {The properties of sandstones as potential reservoirs and shales as source rocks depend on primary facies relationships and diagenesis. Porostiy loss due to mechanical compation and pressure solution is essentially a function of grain parameters (sorting, packing and composition) and net overburden stress. The porosity loss can be predicted to a certain extent. The importance of secondary porosity caused by dissolution of framework grains and cements has been fully recognized. The discussion has focused on the processes causing such dissolution and to what extent it can cause net increase in porosity. The most critical factor in clastic diagenesis is the nature of porewater flow and the degree of mass transfer taking place as a result of this. In the North Sea reservoir rocks, petrographic and geochemical evidence suggest that most of the leaching of feldspar and mica resulting in the formation of kaolinite occurred early during fresh wather flushing. Recent calculations indicate that »acids« derived from source rocks are inadequate to explain the secondary porosity observed in reservoir rocks. Mathematical modelling suggests that thermal convection is of limited importance in sedimentary basins, except where there are high lateral changes in geothermal gradients. Evidence from porewater geochemistry suggests that porewaters in sedimentary basins are often stratified or compartmentalized in a way which is inconsistent with large scale convection or compactional flow, making it necessary to assume that diagenetic reactions are relatively isochemical during deeper burial. A better understanding of the diagenetic reactions will help us to improve our predictions about porosity/depth relations, pore size, and pore geometry distribution in reservoir rocks. Porosity depth trends from offshore Norway and published data from other basins are discussed. Empirical linear best fit lines are found to illustrate the relationship quite well for depths between one and five km. Within a specific region, the linear porosity gradient is a function of mineral composition and of temperature and pressure gradients. Primary porosity tends to be best preserved in sandstones with high proportions of stable grains (e. g. in quartz arenites) down to about 3 or 4 km. At greater depth, porosity loss is accelerated due to increased pressure solution. Secondary and primary porosity adjacent to feldspar grains then tends to be selectively preserved relative to primary pores between quartz grains.},

In Belgium, the Boom Clay is a candidate host rock for deep geological disposal. In this study, we analyze the effects of fractures and spatially variable hydraulic conductivity on radionuclide migration through the clay. Fracture geometry and properties are simulated with Monte Carlo simulation. The heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity is simulated by direct sequential co-simulation using measurements of hydraulic conductivity and four types of secondary variables. The hydraulic conductivity and fracture simulations are used as input for a transport model. Radionuclide fluxes computed with this heterogeneous model are compared with fluxes obtained with a homogeneous model. The output fluxes of the heterogeneous model differ at most 8% from the homogeneous model. The main safety function of the Boom Clay is thus not affected by the fractures and the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity.},

MVT leachates from the Illinois-Kentucky and Cincinnati arch districts and from cubic galena in the Viburnum Trend have Na/Br and Cl/Br ratios that extend to values significantly above that of seawater, which are characteristic of evaporite-dissolution brines. MVT leachates from Polaris and octahedral galena in the Viburnum Trend have Na/Br and Cl/Br ratios that plot below seawater and along the compositional trend formed by evaporation. Solubility-volume constraints require that brines formed by seawater evaporation had high dissolved metal contents. Preliminary correlation of leachate compositions allows delineation of two brine provinces in the midcontinent United States: (1) an early, high-Br province found only in southeastern Missouri, and (2) a later, low-Br province of probable Permian age that extended from the Cincinnati arch to the Tri-State district. These observations, along with Na-Cl-Br data for modern brines from the Illinois basin, argue against models for single-stage midcontinent MVT brine flow based on recharge from late Paleozoic (Arkoma) foreland basins to the south.},

The quantities of fluid involved are such that significant hydrothermal mineralisation may result from each seismically induced fluid pulse, and the mechanism provides an explanation for the textures of hydrothermal vein deposits associated with ancient faults, which almost invariably indicate that mineralisation was episodic.},

abstract = {Mathematical modeling is used in this study to assess how tectonic movement of fault blocks and fault permeability influence the present-day and paleohydrogeology of the Rio Grande Rift near Socorro, New Mexico. Our analysis focuses on active and ancient groundwater flow patterns and hot spring development within the southern La Jencia and Socorro subbasins. The best agreement between model results and present-day and paleoheat flow data was achieved by representing faults as passive surfaces and incorporating 2 km of moderately permeable (10 -14.0 m 2) fractured crystalline rocks into the hydrogeologic model. Quantitative results indicate that changes in groundwater flow patterns across the basin are primarily generated by the truncation/reconnection of aquifers and confining units. Calculated flow patterns help to explain the annealing of apatite fission tracks within Eocene Baca Formation clasts to the east of Socorro, potassium metasomatism mass balance constraints within Oligocene volcanics and overlying Santa Fe Group deposits, and the timing of barite/fluorite ore mineralization within the Gonzales prospect on the eastern edge of the Rio Grande Rift. We estimate that about 5% of mountain front recharge penetrates to a depth of 2.8 km below the sedimentary pile. This may have implications for water resource planners who have historically focused on groundwater resource development within the shallow alluvial deposits along the Rio Grande Rift valley.},

abstract = {Fluid flow and deformation in regions of fractured rock around extensional faults have been modelled using distinct element methods (UDEC code). The basic methodology is described in terms of a simple model of a planar normal fault zone, at the Earth's surface. The model is then modified to simulate deformation at greater depths and to investigate irregularities in fault shape (including dilational and anti-dilational fault jogs). The results obtained show that the deformation of a faulted region resulted in significant variation in fracture dilation (porosity), stress distribution, fluid pressure and fluid flow. The geometry of models and the applied boundary conditions had important effects on deformation and fluid flow. At shallow depth, dilation and fluid flow occurred both in the fault zone and the hangingwall, with little change in the footwall. At greater depth, the higher compressive stresses tended to close all fractures, except within the fault zone where the shear displacements caused local dilation. The presence of anti-dilational bends reduced the dilation and fluid flow in the fault zone, but promoted greater deformation in parts of the hangingwall. The dynamic response of fracture aperture, pore pressure and shear displacement to fault slip was also studied. The modelled results are in reasonable correspondence with observed natural examples and have practical significance for evaluating fluid flow and deformation in regions which exhibit normal faulting.},

In this paper a simple method is presented to determine heat production from normal gamma ray logs which are readily available from a vast number of boreholes. This method is based on a linear relationship between the gamma ray GR and the heat production A. For a wide variety of lithologies extending from granite through gneiss, carbonate and amphibolite to basaltic rocks, it is shown, that this relation is valid in the range 0-350 API and 0.03-7 [mu]W/m3 respectively with an error lower than 10%.

abstract = {Groundwater is a primary source of fresh water in many parts of the world. Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly. Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India, but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 +/- 1.0 cm yr(-1) equivalent height of water (17.7 +/- 4.5 km(3) yr(-1)) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km(3) of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses.},

abstract = {Variations in rock magnetic properties are responsible for the many linear, short-wavelength, low-amplitude magnetic anomalies that are spatially associated with faults that cut Neogene basin sediments in the Rio Grande rift, including the San Ysidro normal fault, which is well exposed in the northern part of the Albuquerque Basin. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements from 310 sites distributed through a 1200-m-thick composite section of rift-filling sediments of the Santa Fe Group and prerift Eocene and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks document large variations of magnetic properties juxtaposed by the San Ysidro fault. Mean volume magnetic susceptibilities generally increase upsection through eight map units: from 1.7 to 2.2E-4 in the prerift Eocene and Cretaceous rocks to 9.9E-4–1.2E-3 in three members of the Miocene Zia Formation of the Santa Fe Group to 1.5E-3–3.5E-3 in three members of the Miocene–Pleistocene Arroyo Ojito Formation of the Santa Fe Group. Rock magnetic measurements and petrography indicate that the amount of detrital magnetite and its variable oxidation to maghemite and hematite within the Santa Fe Group sediments are the predominant controls of their magnetic property variations. Magnetic susceptibility increases progressively with sediment grain size within the members of the Arroyo Ojito Formation (deposited in fluvial environments) but within members of the Zia Formation (deposited in mostly eolian environments) reaches highest values in fine to medium sands. Partial oxidation of detrital magnetite is spatially associated with calcite cementation in the Santa Fe Group. Both oxidation and cementation probably reflect past flow of groundwater through permeable zones. Magnetic models for geologic cross sections that incorporate mean magnetic susceptibilities for the different stratigraphic units mimic the aeromagnetic profiles across the San Ysidro fault and demonstrate that the stratigraphic level of dominant magnetic contrast changes with different exposure levels into the fault. These data indicate that tectonic juxtaposition of primary variations of magnetic properties of strata across the fault is the source of the associated magnetic anomaly. This study indicates that magnetic anomalies over faults and folds can be generated by sediments (1) deposited within tectonic basins having volcanic or basement source areas rich in magnetite, (2) having depositional environments with sufficient but varying energy to transport dense magnetic minerals and cause stratigraphic changes of magnetic properties, and (3) having magnetic minerals preserved owing to their youth or nonreactive geochemical environments.},

Lateral viscosity variations generally do not change the direction of shear tractions, but deeply penetrating continental roots increase traction magnitudes by a factor of 2-5 compared to 100 km thick lithosphere. A low-viscosity asthenosphere decreases traction magnitudes by a smaller amount, and is important only if >100 km thick. Increased plate-mantle coupling beneath thick continental lithosphere may increase plate-driving forces, surface deformation, and mantle-derived lithospheric stresses in these regions. By contrast, a low-viscosity asthenosphere does not decouple the lithosphere from mantle flow, highlighting the geological importance of mantle tractions on the lithosphere.},

Surface and tunnel (U-Th)/He ages (17–9 Ma and 13–5 Ma, respectively) are consistently younger than the equivalent fission track ages. (U-Th)/He ages vary systematically along the tunnel with older ages at the northern and southern tunnel portals and younger ages in the central section. Geological factors (faulting, lithology) appear to have had little effect on this age distribution. The (U-Th)/He age pattern is inconsistent with rock cooling underneath the present-day Hochalm-Ankogel Dome topography. The age minimum is interpreted to coincide with a paleotopographic maximum in the Hochalm-Ankogel Dome and suggests that the 40–60�C isotherms were warped sufficiently to affect apatite (U-Th)/He ages. The tunnel apatite (U-Th)/He ages match synthetic He ages derived from a two-dimensional numerical model of landscape evolution. Integrating the thermal model results with the data allows the relief development to be constrained and we calculate that the present-day Hochalm-Ankogel Dome topography was formed at 7 to 10 Ma.},

abstract = {The McKenzie model proposed in 1978, which is widely used in calculating the thermal history of rift basins and other extensional basins, incorrectly assumes that all heat passing through the lithosphere originates below the lithosphere. In reality, heat from radiogenic sources within the lithosphere, especially in the upper crust, may represent more than half the heat flow at the top of basement. Thinning of the lithosphere during extension does indeed result in an increase of heat flowing from the asthenosphere, but this thinning also reduces the radiogenic heat from within the lithosphere. Because these two effects cancel to a large degree, the direct effects of lithospheric extension on heat flow at the top of basement are smaller than those predicted by the McKenzie model. Because of permanent loss of radiogenic material by lithospheric thinning, the heat flow at the top of basement long after rifting will be lower than the pre-rift heat flow.},

Furthermore, Ceres was designed to handle changing geometry through time as results of sedimentation, erosion, salt or mud creeping and block displacement along fault. The classical flow chart to perform a case study is composed of three main steps. The first step is the building of the present day section. This is generally done with data coming from the seismic interpretation, well data, field data and core data. The second step is the restoration of the section. Thus from the section at present day, the section is restored back in the past for each of the defined layer, and until the substratum is reached. The last step is the forward simulation. And, in order to solve the coupled equations that are generally used in basin models, we had to develop original numerical methods based on domain decomposition techniques. The Ceres prototype has now been used to study petroleum systems. It has been used to perform sensitivity studies on fault permeability in the Bolivian foothills and the Congo offshore. In the Gulf of Mexico, it allowed to study the impact of the salt tectonics on the hydrocarbon migration. More recently, the Ceres prototype has been tested, within the frame of the SubTrap consortium, in thrust areas such as the Canadian foothills and the Eastern Venezuelan foothills. For these last case studies, it has been beneficial that structural geologists were involved at all stages of the process.},

Despite the large fraction of unconsolidated sediments on Earth's surface with a wide range of permeability values, current global, high-resolution permeability maps distinguish solely fine-grained and coarse-grained unconsolidated sediments. Representative permeability values are derived for a wide variety of unconsolidated sediments and applied to a new global map of unconsolidated sediments to produce the first geologically constrained, two-layer global map of shallower and deeper permeability. The new mean logarithmic permeability of the Earth's surface is −12.7 ± 1.7 m2 being 1 order of magnitude higher than that derived from previous maps, which is consistent with the dominance of the coarser sediments. The new data set will benefit a variety of scientific applications including the next generation of climate, land surface, and hydrology models at regional to global scales.},

abstract = {As numerous studies have demonstrated, groundwater flow can have a significant impact on subsurface temperatures, and therefore also on exhumation histories derived from thermochronological studies. Our research aims to quantify this influence by including fluid flow in numerical models for the thermal behaviour of the crust and sediments. These models will be applied to the Roer Valley Graben in the southern Netherlands. One of the parameters to consider in this research are variations in recharge and discharge rates in the area. Commonly, numerical simulations of groundwater flow on basin scales represent the upper model boundary by a fixed hydraulic head at the position of the water table. This approach does not impose any constraints on recharge and discharge rates at the upper model boundary and could therefore lead to unrealistic estimates of the thermal effects of groundwater flow. To evaluate the potential effect of recharge on subsurface temperatures a parameter sensitivity study was conducted using a 2D numerical model of groundwater and heat flow. As a first step, the sensitivity analysis was conducted on a synthetic 20 km wide and 12 km deep basin, with a variation in water table elevation of 100 m. Preliminary results indicate that recharge can have a significant effect on subsurface temperatures. Using best estimates of recharge and permeability, the simulated advective cooling reaches values of up to 10 °C, and is mainly confined to the upper 2 km of the model domain. A fixed hydraulic head boundary condition can lead to values of groundwater recharge which are unrealistic given best estimates of the bandwith of recharge during geological history. Permeabilties of the upper part of the model of ≤10-14 m2 result in unrealistically low values of recharge (less than 10 mm/yr), while permeabilities of ≥10-11 m2 can result in recharge values in excess of 1000 mm/yr. These recharge rates can lead to underestimation or overestimation of advective cooling that exceed a factor of 4. Both recharge and the thermal effects of recharge are highly sensitive to the variation of permeability with depth. The sensitivity of recharge to anisotropy and water table elevation is much lower, although both parameters can still have a large impact on subsurface temperatures. The preliminary conclusion is that we will have to incorporate a more realistic representation of recharge in the model for our research-objectives. In addition to an improved description of recharge, we will incorporate the influence of faults and of groundwater salinity gradients on fluid flow. The models will be used to quantify to what extent fluid flow can explain subsurface temperatures as well as paleo-geothermal gradients inferred from apatite fission tracks from several borehole samples. Constraints will be based on a large geological dataset including approximately 100 boreholes and over 1000 km of seismic lines, as well as data and a large number of previous studies on stratigraphy, fluid flow during geological history and subsurface temperatures. The effects of groundwater flow on the thermal structure of the crust will be compared to the effect of other thermal processes, such as conduction, advection, heat production, topographic changes, fault movements, erosion and sedimentation.},

This review presents the state of knowledge in SI research, compares classes of methods for assessing and managing SI, and suggests areas for future research. We subdivide SI research into categories relating to processes, measurement, prediction and management. Considerable research effort spanning more than 50. years has provided an extensive array of field, laboratory and computer-based techniques for SI investigation. Despite this, knowledge gaps exist in SI process understanding, in particular associated with transient SI processes and timeframes, and the characterization and prediction of freshwater-saltwater interfaces over regional scales and in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings. Multidisciplinary research is warranted to evaluate interactions between SI and submarine groundwater discharge, ecosystem health and unsaturated zone processes. Recent advances in numerical simulation, calibration and optimization techniques require rigorous field-scale application to contemporary issues of climate change, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic and ecological factors that are inseparable elements of SI management. The number of well-characterized examples of SI is small, and this has impeded understanding of field-scale processes, such as those controlling mixing zones, saltwater upconing, heterogeneity effects and other factors. Current SI process understanding is based mainly on numerical simulation and laboratory sand-tank experimentation to unravel the combined effects of tides, surface water-groundwater interaction, heterogeneity, pumping and density contrasts. The research effort would benefit from intensive measurement campaigns to delineate accurately interfaces and their movement in response to real-world coastal aquifer stresses, encompassing a range of geological and hydrological settings. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These values, plus an understanding of the effects of cooling in response to long-term climatic changes, are particularly important when estimating the amount of denudation experienced by the sequences during cooling from maximum palaeotemperatures. In this case study, AFT data have been generated for subsurface samples from eight wells drilled within the North Slope foreland basin of northern Alaska in an effort to study the thermal history of the basin. The combination of Ro and AFT data establish that maximum palaeotemperatures were attained within the North Slope foreland basin prior to cooling beginning in the Palaeocene. Furthermore, they indicate that palaeogeothermal gradients when cooling began were close to the present-day values, and that Cenozoic surface cooling resulted in a significant amount of ‘apparent' denudation. These results suggest that heating throughout the basin was largely due to deeper burial, and that cooling was due to both removal of section by denudation and a drop in the mean annual surface temperature.},

Egeberg (3) AAPG Bulletin Volume 77 (1993) Exploration in deeper parts of sedimentary basins requires a better understanding of the rate and timing of quartz cementation, one of the main factors controlling reservoir quality in well-sorted sandstones. In the recent literature on sandstone diagenesis, quartz cementation is frequently interpreted as having occurred at relatively shallow depths and at low temperatures. In continually subsiding sedimentary basins like the North Sea and the Gulf Coast, however, sandstones buried to less than about 2.5-3.0 km have very little quartz cement. Fluid inclusion data from North Sea reservoirs indicate that most of the quartz cement forms at temperatures exceeding 90-100°C. Fluid inclusion temperatures in quartz overgrowths commonly approach bottom-hole temperatures, suggesting that quartz cementation may continue, probably at a reduced rate, after oil emplacement. Evidence of local dissolution of quartz by pressure solution is usually well developed in North Sea sandstones that contain si nificant quartz cement, but the volume of silica released is difficult to quantify. Amorphous silica and opal CT may be important sources of silica for quartz cementation at 70-80°C, and the existence of such metastable silica phases at lower temperatures is evidence that quartz does not then precipitate for kinetic reasons. Modeling shows that diffusion of silica is insignificant on a large scale (hundreds of meters), but is important on a smaller scale, particularly when amorphous silica and opal CT are present. At higher temperatures, the pore water will approach equilibrium with respect to quartz. Quartz precipitation will then result from upward (cooling) pore water flow. Calculations show that if enough silica to precipitate a significant volume of quartz (1%) from external sources is to be introduced into sandstones by pore water flow, a flux of about 108 cm3/cm2 would be required. Such fluxes could be obtained only on a local scale and by assuming an extreme degree of focusing of compactional water or by thermal convection. Modeling of coupled carbonate and silicate reactions can be useful in constraining our theories of solid transport in sedimentary basins. Calculations indicate that for cooling (rising) pore water, the rate of calcite dissolution exceeds the rate of quartz cementation by a factor of 30 to 300, depending on the pH of the pore water, which is assumed to be buffered by the silicate minerals. If the pore water is buffered by the carbonate system, the rate of calcite dissolution upon cooling is smaller, but still several times higher than for quartz. If significant volumes of quartz cement are introduced by advective flow of cooling pore water, all calcite present should, in most cases, have been dissolved, given the higher reverse solubility/temperature function of carbonates. We suggest that the source of quartz cement in sandstones is predominantly local (<10 m), sourced from within the sandstones, mainly by pressure solution. Therefore, one must predict the porosity loss in reservoirs from internal textural and mineralogical properties of the sandstones in addition to temperature and pressure. INTRODUCTION Quartz cement is responsible for much of the porosity and permeability reduction in well-sorted quartz-rich sandstones that have been buried deeper than 3 km. The percentage of quartz cement vary greatly in the Jurassic Brent Group of the North Sea at depths exceeding 4 km and is then the main factor controlling porosity, which may range from less than 10 to 20% (Bjorlykke et al., 1992; Giles et al. 1992; Harris, 1992). Predicting porosity trends, both on regional and on reservoir scales, recently has become more important as exploration in many basins focuses on deeper reservoirs. Therefore, one must understand the processes controlling quartz End_Page 1538------------------------------ dissolution and precipitation. Identifying the sources of silica that contribute to quartz cementation during diagenesis is the main problem. However, quantifying the volume of dissolved quartz and other silicates petrographically also can be difficult. In cases where there is abundant quartz cement but little evidence of quartz dissolution, the source may be difficult to identify. The timing of quartz cementation relative to temperature and burial depth also is important in terms of predicting porosity loss as a function of progressive burial. We present two end member models. (1) Most of the silica precipitated as quartz cement is derived from local sources and transported mostly by diffusion over distances of a few centimeters up to meters. (2) A large percent of the quartz cement is derived by pore-water flow from sources some distance (>10-100 m) away from the site of precipitation. In the model 1, the rate of quartz cementation will strongly depend on the rate of dissolution of silicate minerals and amorphous silica within the sandstones and adjacent shales. In model 2, the distribution of quartz cement would be primarily a function of pore-water flow. If most of the silica is "imported" from sources several meters away from the sandstones, one must base predictions of the degree of quartz cementation (and porosity) on models for pore-water flow. Assuming that the pore water is in equilibrium with quartz, the rate of cementation is a direct function of the vertical component of the pore water flux and geothermal gradient. In this paper, we discuss these two alternative hypotheses for the source of SiO2 by reviewing data on the distribution of quartz c ment in sandstones from sedimentary basins, mainly the North Sea Basin and the Gulf Coast, and by presenting theoretical models for transport of silica in pore water. TEMPERATURE OF QUARTZ CEMENTATION IN SEDIMENTARY BASINS The timing of quartz cementation relative to burial can be inferred from textural evidence, isotopic analyses, and fluid inclusions. Important information also can be obtained from the distribution of quartz cement with depth in continuously subsiding basins. Several authors have concluded that quartz cementation occurred at intermediate burial depths of 1-2 km (e.g., Gluyas, 1985; Dutton and Land, 1988; McBride, 1989). The main phase of quartz cementation in the Lower Cretaceous Travis Peak Formation (Gulf of Mexico) occurred at a burial depth of 1-1.5 km, with quartz cement derived from circulating meteoric fluids, according to Dutton and Diggs (1990). Several studies in other basins also concluded that quartz cementation occurred relatively early and predated precipitation of kaolinite and illite (Almon and Davis, 1979; Odum et al., 1979; Schmidt and McDonald, 1979; Tillman and Almon, 1979). In older sandstones, now exposed on land, quartz commonly is inferred to have precipitated relatively early at shallow burial. Girard and Deynoux ( 991) interpreted the quartz cement in upper Proterozoic quartzites from west Africa to have precipitated at 0 to 50°C, based on isotopic evidence. Stable isotope analyses of quartz cement also may indicate temperatures of quartz cementation. The separation of quartz cement from the grains, however, is difficult and the isotopic composition of the pore water at the time of precipitation is usually poorly constrained. Frequently, isotopic compositions range from 16 to 20^pmil (Dutton and Land, 1988; Potocki, 1989; Brint et al., 1991; Girard and Deyneoux, 1991), but the range of temperatures inferred varies greatly. In Gulf Coast sandstones, the range Table 1. Temperatures for Quartz Precipitation Measured from Fluid Inclusions in Reservoir Sandstones End_Page 1539------------------------------ observed is between 14-34^pmil (McBride, 1989). Microthermometry is important in terms of constraining the temperature of quartz cementation, and recent studies suggest that, in the case of quartz cement, there is little natural deformation in the fluid inclusions that could lead to erroneous measurements (Robinson and Glyas, 1992). Published fluid inclusion data from the North Sea Basin and Haltenbanken (Table 1) suggest that quartz cementation starts at about 80-100°C, and that the upper temperature limit increases with the present-day burial depth. In the North Sea Basin, we find that sandstones buried to 1.5-2.5 km are still poorly indurated unless carbonate cemented, and have very little quartz cement. The Middle Jurassic Brent Group, which is the main reservoir sandstone in the northern North Sea, is extensively cored at depths between 1.8 and 4.5 km. Very little quartz cement is found in the sandstones buried to less than 2.5 km, and quartz cement generally increases with a burial depth of between 3.0-4.5 km (Bjorlykke et al., 1992; Giles et al., 1992; Ramm, 1992). A similar pattern of quartz cementation is observed in reservoirs from the Haltenbanken area (offshore mid-Norway), (Bjorlykke et al., 1986; Ehrenberg, 1990). In the Miocene sandstones of the Gulf Coast region, quartz cementation seems to start at about 3 km burial depth, whereas the Pliocene sandstones do not show significant quartz cement in depths shallower than 4 km (Harrison and Summa, 1991). Sharp et al. (1988) stated that in the Cenozoic section of the Gulf Coast, quartz cement is found only in rocks heated to greater than 100°C. The higher temperatures required for quartz cementation in the youngest (Pliocene) sediments suggest a kinetic (time-temperature) control on porosity loss and quartz cementation (Bloch et al., 1986, 1990; Harrison, 1989). Early quartz cementation seems to be rare in continuously subsiding basins like the Gulf Coast and the North Sea. SOURCES OF SILICA AND KINETICS OF QUARTZ CEMENTATION Quartz cements in sandstones may be derived from several internal sources: (1) more soluble silica phases, e.g., amorphous sili},

abstract = {For basin modelling purposes, uplift and erosion analysis is as important as subsidence analysis. Within the North Alpine Foreland Basin of Switzerland (NAFB) three major interregional unconformities separate the sedimentary succession: the late Palaeozoic, the base Tertiary and the base Quaternary unconformity. The amount of missing section depends on the palaeogeographic basin position and on different inversion mechanisms (thermal uplift, intraplate stress, tectonic uplift or isostatic rebound movements). Several techniques exist to determine the magnitude and timing of maximum palaeotemperatures and palaeogradients, facilitating direct estimation of missing section. In our study coalification and fission track data are analysed and compared with recently published models concerning erosion in the NAFB. The results indicate that each inversion episode is accompanied by significant erosion (up to several $\sim$rt). The following range of removed section values were reconstructed: (i) late Palaeozoic unconformity: 1000-1200 m; (ii) base Tertiary unconformity: 800-1800 m; (iii) base Quaternary unconformity: 1500-3000 m in the SW, up to 700 m in the NE and 4100-4400 m in parts close to the Alpine front. The reconstruction techniques provide only rough estimates as each approach is based on certain assumptions and calibration uncertainties. Also, the obtained values are higher than those expected from simple evaluation of the preserved stratigraphic record. Calculated palaeo- geothermal gradients are very high (80-90 $\sim$ km -1) during the late Palaeozoic, slightly higher than normal during the late Cretaceous (30-50 $\sim$ km -1) and lower than normal (15-30 $\sim$ km -$\sim$) during the Cenozoic.

A regression analysis of thermal conductivity, bulk density, and sonic velocity yields thermal conductivity with an average accuracy of better than . As a second step, logging data are used to compute a lithological depth profile, which in turn is used to calculate a thermal conductivity profile. From a comparison of the conductivity-depth profile and the laboratory data, it can be concluded that thermal conductivity can be computed with an accuracy of less than from conventional wireline data. The comparison of two different models shows that this approach can be practical even if old and incomplete logging data are used. The results can be used to infer thermal conductivity for boreholes without appropriate core data that are drilled in a similar geological setting.},

Geologically both sites belong to Alpine nappe units and consist of generally low permeable rocks with hydraulic conductivities in the range of 10-10-10-8 m s-1. Elevation of topography attains 2.4-3.1 km, and the mountain water table exhibits a correspondingly high relief. The geothermal regime of the area is characterized by relatively high values of measured heat flow on the order of 80-100 mW m-2. The results reveal well developed subsurface fluid circulation systems in both cases. The vertical fluid velocities reach some cm/yr, which is higher by more than one order of magnitude than the flow rates in flat terrain. In mountainous terrain, flow systems may penetrate to depths of 2-3 km below sea level. The discharge zones in areas with high relief and steep slopes are rather narrow and concentrate at and near the valley bottoms. Such zones are the regions of heating where positive disturbances may reach up to 1.5-1.8 times the basal heat flow value. In the recharge areas at ridges, heat flow may in turn become quite low. The calculated thermohydraulic models have been validated by measured temperature distributions in drillholes. Reasonably good agreement between the measured and the calculated temperatures exists for both sites.},

abstract = {The Patos-Mirim Lagoon system along the southern coast of Brazil is linked to the coastal ocean by a narrow mouth and by groundwater transport through a Holocene barrier. Although other groundwater systems are apparently active in this region, the hydraulic head of the lagoon, the largest in South America, drives groundwater transport to the coast. Water levels in wells placed in the barrier respond to changing water level in the lagoon. The wells also provide a measure of the nutrient concentrations of groundwater flowing toward the ocean. Additionally, temporary well points were used to obtain nutrient samples in groundwater on the beach face of the barrier. These samples revealed a subterranean freshwater-seawater mixing zone over a ca. 240 km shoreline. Previously published results of radium isotopic analyses of groundwater and of surface water from cross-shelf transects were used to estimate a water flux of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to nearshore surface waters of 8.5 × 107 m3/day. Using this SGD and the nutrient concentrations in different compartments, nutrient fluxes between groundwater and surface water were estimated. Fluxes were computed using both average and median reservoir (i.e. groundwater and surface water) nutrient concentrations. The SGD total dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and silicate fluxes (2.42, 0.52, 5.92 × 106 mol day- 1, respectively) may represent as much as 55% (total N) to 10% (Si) of the nutrient fluxes to the adjacent shelf environment. Assuming nitrogen limitation, SGD may be capable of supporting a production rate of ca. 3000 g C m2 year- 1in the nearshore surf zone in this region. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Bolivian Sub-Andean Zone (SAZ) corresponds to a Neogene thrust system that affects an about 10-km thick Palaeozoic to Neogene siliciclastic succession. The analysis of macro and microstructures and cement distribution in thrust fault zones shows that they are sealed by quartz at depths \textgreater 3 km, due to local silica transfer by pressure-solution/precipitation activated at temperatures \textgreater70-90 [degree sign]C. At shallower depths, faults have remained open and could be preferential drains for lateral flow of carbonate-bearing fluids, as shown by the occurrence of carbonate cements in fractures and their host-sandstone. Due to decreasing burial, resulting from foothill erosion during fault activity, critically buried fault segments can be affected by non-quartz-sealed structures that post-date initial quartz-sealed structures. The integration of textural, fluid inclusion and isotopic data shows that carbonates precipitated at shallow depth (\textless3 km), low temperature (\textless80 [degree sign]C) and relatively late during the thrusting history. Isotopic data also show that precipitation occurred from the mixing of gravity-driven meteoric water with deeper formation water bearing carbonate carbon derived from the maturation of hydrocarbon source rocks (Silurian and Devonian shales). The combined microstructural and isotopic analyses indicate that: (i) fluid flow in fault zones often occurred with successive pulses derived from different or evolving sources and probably related to episodic fault activity, and (ii) at a large-scale, the faults have a low transverse permeability and they separate thrust sheets with different fluid histories.},

abstract = {This contribution proposes a number of methodological refinements for accounting for ejection of energetic particles, most particularly in the case of long alpha-particle stopping distance effects in (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronometry. Recent stopping-distance estimates for minerals commonly used for thermochronometry are up to 1.5$\mu$m shorter than previously thought, which directly affects the magnitude of the ejection correction parameter FT. The revision in stopping distances necessitates re-fitting the empirical polynomials that have been used to calculate FT corrections for various crystal forms. Reformulation and re-parameterization of these polynomials enables them to account for present and any future change in stopping distances without needing to be recalibrated. The library of shapes described with these polynomials to accommodate habits is expanded for all crystal systems and also ellipsoids, thus covering all minerals currently used and under development for (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronometry. In addition, the inaccuracy caused by characterizing a set of alpha particles from a decay chain with a single mean stopping distance is examined, and a simple method for compensation is recommended. A new method of using FT parameters to calculate corrected ages by applying them to parents instead of daughters or age is presented, which maximizes accuracy for old specimens such as meteorites. Altogether, the refinements proposed will affect (U–Th–Sm)/He ages by ∼1–5%, depending on size and age. Finally, the concept of an FT-equivalent sphere is introduced as a sphere with the same effective FT value as a given mineral grain. Testing indicates that the FT-equivalent sphere is of comparable or superior accuracy to a sphere of the same surface to volume ratio for diffusion modeling. This finding greatly facilitates utilization of (U–Th–Sm)/He data from standard data tables for forward and inverse modeling.},

abstract = {In spite of the fact that thermal conductivity is a key factor in basin modelling, knowledge regarding the thermal conductivity of sedimentary rocks is scarce. In particular, hardly any information exists about claystones and mudstones which can make up 70-80% of a sedimentary basin. For the Upper Jurassic sediments of a section across the northern North Sea, basin modelling programs, using the geometric mean model, gave a deviation of 50degreesC for the present-day temperature, simply because the matrix conductivity was estimated by two different models. These uncertainties in the determination of thermal conductivities are partly due to problems in measuring, and partly to difficulties in modelling the thermal conductivity. Future work should concentrate on comparative studies and tests on all types of sedimentary rocks, directed towards improved measurement methods. This is of particular importance for clays, mudstones and shales, as measurements on these are associated with the greatest uncertainties. Standardized procedures that include detailed descriptions of sampling, sample preparation and measurement techniques are important to ensure that the thermal conductivity measured is unaffected by factors related to the measurement method. In thermal conductivity modelling it is our experience that the influence of sediment texture is underestimated by most models currently applied. Estimates based on the geometric mean model seem to be most reliable when the determination of matrix conductivity is restricted to the sediment type, mineralogy and texture of the sediments.},

abstract = {Neogene-to-Recent deformation is widespread on and adjacent to Australia's ‘passive' margins. Elevated historical seismic activity and relatively high levels of Neogene-to-Recent tectonic activity are recognized in the Flinders and Mount Lofty Ranges, the SE Australian Passive Margin, SW Western Australia and the North West Shelf. In all cases the orientation of palaeostresses inferred from Neogene-to-Recent structures is consistent with independent determinations of the orientation of the present-day stress field.Present-day stress orientations (and neotectonic palaeostress trends) vary across the Australian continent. Plate-scale stress modelling that incorporates the complex nature of the convergent plate boundary of the Indo-Australian Plate (with segments of continent–continent collision, continent–arc collision and subduction) indicates that present-day stress orientations in the Australian continent are consistent with a first-order control by plate-boundary forces. The consistency between the present-day, plate-boundary-sourced stress orientations and the record of deformation deduced from neotectonic structures implicates plate boundary forces in the ongoing intraplate deformation of the Australian continent.Deformation rates inferred from seismicity and neotectonics (as high as 10−16 s−1) are faster than seismic strain rates in many other ‘stable' intraplate regions, suggestive of unusually high stress levels imposed on the Australian intraplate environment from plate boundary interactions many thousands of kilometres distant. The spatial overlap of neotectonic structures and zones of concentrated historical seismicity with ancient fault zones and/or regions of enhanced crustal heat flow indicates that patterns of active deformation in Australia are in part, governed, by prior tectonic structuring and are also related to structural and thermal weakening of continental crust. Neogene-to-Recent intraplate deformation within the Australian continent has had profound and under-recognized effects on hydrocarbon occurrence, both by amplifying some hydrocarbon-hosting structures and by inducing leakage from pre-existing traps due to fault reactivation or tilting.},

abstract = {At many subduction zones, accretionary complexes form as sediment is off-scraped from the subducting plate. Mechanical models that treat accretionary complexes as critically tapered wedges of sediment demonstrate that pore pressure controls their taper angle by modifying basal and internal shear strength. Here, we combine a numerical model of groundwater flow with critical taper theory to quantify the effects of sediment and d{\'{e}}collement permeability, sediment thickness, sediment partitioning between accretion and underthrusting, and plate convergence rate on steady state pore pressure. Our results show that pore pressure in accretionary wedges can be viewed as a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). We find that sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. For our base case model scenario, as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable taper angles to increase from ∼2.5° to 8°–12.5°. With increased sediment thickness in our models (from 100 to 8000 m), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable taper angle from 8.4°–12.5° to <2.5–5°. In general, low-permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Our model results compare favorably with available data from active accretionary complexes. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin taper angles, whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have steep taper angles. Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing taper angle (from >15° to <4°) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km). One key implication is that hydrologic properties may strongly influence the strength of the crust in a wide range of geologic settings.},

These events leave higher temperature signatures in affected basins than predicted from burial under conditions of vertical conductive heat transfer, and should be considered during hydrocarbon appraisal of a prospective basin. The Rathlin Basin displays a thermal history influenced by one or more such hot fluid flow events, with fluid palaeotemperatures in excess of 170degreesC recorded in the Permo-Triassic and Carboniferous section, and is typical of other Atlantic margin basins affected in this way.},

abstract = {Exploration in deeper parts of sedimentary basins requires a better understanding of the rate and timing of quartz cementation, one of the main factors controlling reservoir quality in well-sorted sandstones. In the recent literature on sandstone diagenesis, quartz cementation is frequently interpreted as having occurred at relatively shallow depths and at low temperatures. In continually subsiding sedimentary basins like the North Sea and the Gulf Coast, however, sandstones buried to less than about 2.5-3.0 km have very little quartz cement. Fluid inclusion data from North Sea reservoirs indicate that most of the quartz cement forms at temperatures exceeding 90-100°C. Fluid inclusion temperatures in quartz overgrowths commonly approach bottom-hole temperatures, suggesting that quartz cementation may continue, probably at a reduced rate, after oil emplacement. Evidence of local dissolution of quartz by pressure solution is usually well developed in North Sea sandstones that contain si nificant quartz cement, but the volume of silica released is difficult to quantify. Amorphous silica and opal CT may be important sources of silica for quartz cementation at 70-80°C, and the existence of such metastable silica phases at lower temperatures is evidence that quartz does not then precipitate for kinetic reasons. Modeling shows that diffusion of silica is insignificant on a large scale (hundreds of meters), but is important on a smaller scale, particularly when amorphous silica and opal CT are present. At higher temperatures, the pore water will approach equilibrium with respect to quartz. Quartz precipitation will then result from upward (cooling) pore water flow. Calculations show that if enough silica to precipitate a significant volume of quartz (1%) from external sources is to be introduced into sandstones by pore water flow, a flux of about 108 cm3/cm2 would be required. Such fluxes could be obtained only on a local scale and by assuming an extreme degree of focusing of compactional water or by thermal convection. Modeling of coupled carbonate and silicate reactions can be useful in constraining our theories of solid transport in sedimentary basins. Calculations indicate that for cooling (rising) pore water, the rate of calcite dissolution exceeds the rate of quartz cementation by a factor of 30 to 300, depending on the pH of the pore water, which is assumed to be buffered by the silicate minerals. If the pore water is buffered by the carbonate system, the rate of calcite dissolution upon cooling is smaller, but still several times higher than for quartz. If significant volumes of quartz cement are introduced by advective flow of cooling pore water, all calcite present should, in most cases, have been dissolved, given the higher reverse solubility/temperature function of carbonates. We suggest that the source of quartz cement in sandstones is predominantly local (<10 m), sourced from within the sandstones, mainly by pressure solution. Therefore, one must predict the porosity loss in reservoirs from internal textural and mineralogical properties of the sandstones in addition to temperature and pressure.},

This paper describes the steps taken in a recent integrated assessment and evaluation of the geothermal potential of the most populated areas of Switzerland. The methodology accounts for individual utilization scenarios and is based on temperature data that have been systematically collected over many years. The state-of-the-art compilation involves comprehensive 3-D regional geological and thermal models of 20-40 km extent. Zones of significant convective flow or preferential sites for borehole heat exchanger systems (BHE) can then be identified.

abstract = {This article is concerned with chemical reactions that occur between two interacting parallel fluid flows using mixing in vertical faults as an example. Mineral precipitation associated with fluid flow in permeable fault zones results in mineralization and chemical reaction (alteration) patterns, which in turn are strongly dependent on interactions between solute advection (controlled by fluid flow rates), solute diffusion/dispersion and chemical kinetics. These interactions can be understood by simultaneously considering two dimensionless numbers, the Damk�hler number and the Z-number. The Damk�hler number expresses the interaction between solute advection (flow rate) and chemical kinetics, while the Z-number expresses the interaction between solute diffusion/dispersion and chemical kinetics. Based on the Damk�hler and Z-numbers, two chemical equilibrium length-scales are defined, dominated by either solute advection or by solute diffusion/dispersion. For a permeable vertical fault zone and for a given solute diffusion/dispersion coefficient, there exist three possible types of chemical reaction patterns, depending on both the flow rate and the chemical reaction rate. These three types are: (i) those dominated by solute diffusion and dispersion resulting in precipitation at the lower tip of a vertical fault and as a thin sliver within the fault, (ii) those dominated by solute advection resulting in precipitation at or above the upper tip of the fault, and (iii) those in which advection and diffusion/dispersion play similar roles resulting in wide mineralization within the fault. Theoretical analysis indicates that there exists both an optimal flow rate and an optimal chemical reaction rate, such that chemical equilibrium following focusing and mixing of two fluids may be attained within the fault zone (i.e. type 3). However, for rapid and parallel flows, such as those resulting from a lithostatic pressure gradient, it is difficult for a chemical reaction to reach equilibrium within the fault zone, if the two fluids are not well mixed before entering the fault zone. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the three possible types of chemical reaction patterns.},

abstract = {Surface-water bodies are integral parts of groundwater flow systems. Groundwater interacts with surface water in nearly all landscapes, ranging from small streams, lakes, and wetlands in headwater areas to major river valleys and seacoasts. Although it gener- ally is assumed that topographically high areas are groundwater recharge areas and topographically low areas are groundwater discharge areas, this is true primarily for regional flow systems. The superposition of local flow systems associated with surface-water bodies on this regional framework results in complex interactions between groundwater and surface water in all landscapes, regardless of regional topographic posi- tion. Hydrologic processes associated with the surface- water bodies themselves, such as seasonally high surface-water levels and evaporation and transpiration of groundwater from around the perimeter of surface- water bodies, are a major cause of the complex and seasonally dynamic groundwater flow fields associated with surface water. These processes have been docu- mented at research sites in glacial, dune, coastal, mantled karst, and riverine terrains.},

Numerical simulations are matched against well-established oxygen isotope gradients on the kilometer scale along the thrust. At internal southern locations, strongly channelized thrust-parallel fluid flow requires a high permeability contrast of >100:1 between the mylonite zone and country rocks and a high hydraulic head in the hinterland and footwall. In contrast, isotopic patterns similar to5-10 km farther north indicate a predominantly vertical, upward drainage of fluids. We propose a situation in which the Glarus thrust evolved northward across the boundary between the lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid-pressure regimes-the "impermeable cap." A cyclic behavior of fluid-pressure buildup, fracturing, channelized fluid escape, and seating explains structural and geochemical observations and the best-fit three-dimensional fluid-flow model parameters.},

abstract = {One of the future issues in the forensic application of the haploid Y-chromosome (Y-chr) is surveying the distribution of the Y-chr variation on a micro-geographical scale. Studies on such a scale require observing Y-chr variation on a high resolution, high sampling efforts and reliable genealogical data of all DNA-donors. In the current study we optimised this framework by surveying the micro-geographical distribution of the Y-chr variation in the central-western European region named Brabant. The Duchy of Brabant was a historical region in the Low Countries containing three contemporary Belgian provinces and one Dutch province (Noord-Brabant). 477 males from five a priori defined regions within Brabant were selected based on their genealogical ancestry (known pedigree at least before 1800). The Y-haplotypes were determined based on 37 Y-STR loci and the finest possible level of substructuring was defined according to the latest published Y-chr phylogenetic tree. In total, eight Y-haplogroups and 32 different subhaplogroups were observed, whereby 70% of all participants belonged to only four subhaplogroups: R1b1b2a1 (R-U106), R1b1b2a2* (R-P312*), R1b1b2a2g (R-U152) and I1* (I-M253*). Significant micro-geographical differentiation within Brabant was detected between the Dutch (Noord-Brabant) vs. the Flemish regions based on the differences in (sub)haplogroup frequencies but not based on Y-STR variation within the main subhaplogroups. A clear gradient was found with higher frequencies of R1b1b2 (R-M269) chromosomes in the northern vs. southern regions, mainly related to a trend in the frequency of R1b1b2a1 (R-U106).},

abstract = {Water exchange between the coastal ocean and underlying aquifers provides a newly-recognized source of materials to the ocean. The flux of materials into the ocean from this process is termed submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Both surficial and semi-confined aquifers contribute to SGD. Here we use 226Ra and 228Ra to quantify fluxes of SGD to Port Royal Sound, South Carolina, and to separate fluxes from the Upper Floridan (UFA) and surficial aquifers. Higher activity ratios of 228/226Ra in the surficial aquifer make this separation possible. We estimate total SGD fluxes of about 100 m3 s-1 with about 80% being derived from the surficial aquifer. The SGD flux provides about1.8 × 106 mol d-1 of NH4 with almost 90% from the surficial aquifer. Because of strong differences in the concentration of PO4 within the UFA, PO4 fluxes areless certain. Using the UFA wells with low PO4 concentrations yields a flux of 1.2 × 105 mol d-1; using wells with high concentrations yields a flux of 2.0 × 105 mol d-1. In the first case virtually all of the PO4 flux is from the surficial aquifer; in the second case, 40% is from the UFA.},

abstract = {Advective flows rapidly transport water, solutes, and particles into and out of permeable sand beds and significantly affects the biogeochemistry of coastal environments. In this paper, we reviewed the drivers of porewater and groundwater advection in permeable shelf sediments in an attempt to bridge gaps among different disciplines studying similar problems. We identified the following driving forces: (1) terrestrial hydraulic gradients, (2) seasonal changes in the aquifer level on land moving the location of the subterranean estuary, (3) wave setup and tidal pumping, (4) water level differences across permeable barriers, (5) flow- and topography-induced pressure gradients, (6) wave pumping; (7) ripple and other bed form migration, (8) fluid shear, (9) density-driven convection, (10) bioirrigation and bioturbation, (11) gas bubble upwelling, and (12) sediment compaction. While these drivers occur over spatial scales ranging from mm to km, and temporal scales ranging from seconds to years, their ultimate biogeochemical implications are very similar (i.e., they are often a source of new or recycled nutrients to seawater and transform organic carbon into inorganic carbon). Drivers 2-12 result in no net water input into the ocean. Taking all these mechanisms into account, we conservatively estimate that a volume equivalent to that of the entire ocean is filtered by permeable sediments at time scales of about 3000 years. Quantifying the relative contribution of these drivers is essential to understand the contribution of sediments to the global cycles of matter. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of high-resolution reflection seismic surveys carried out between 1989 and 1996 along rivers and canals in northern Belgium. The seismic data penetrate down to 900 m in the sedimentary cover or to the Paleozoic basement. The reflection response of the acoustic basement provides clear indications with regard to the top of the Paleozoic: crystalline basement and Lower Paleozoic metasediments and volcanics of the London-Brabant Massif and NE-dipping Devonian and Carboniferous strata. The subhorizontal Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary cover comprises 20 unconformity-bound seismic units: 5 in the Cretaceous and 15 in the Cenozoic. Based on borehole information, these units are correlated with lithostratigraphically defined formations or groups. Some of the unit-bounding unconformities are of regional importance. They are attributed i) to eustatic sea-level changes causing regional flooding during the Late Cretaceous or incision of deep valleys during the Late Oligocene and Late Miocene, ii) to regional tectonic tilting between Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, or iii) to a combination of eustasy and tectonics causing valley incisions during the Lutetian. Faults of the Roer Valley Graben have offset different stratigraphic levels by sometimes considerable amounts (up to 230 m in the Oligocene to Quaternary succession). Although the main tectonic phase took place during the Miocene, the activity has varied considerably through time, and also from fault to fault. Most faults seem to have a 10 to 30-m displacement since the Late Pliocene.},

abstract = {This paper presents a 2D computational model which combines (U-Th)/He thermochronometry and U-Pb geochronology data with numerical modeling techniques to quantitatively constrain the thermal and exhumation history of igneous intrusions and associated magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits. The model considers various parameters related to the cooling of intrusive bodies (conduction cooling, latent heat of crystallization and fusion, thermal convection within magma bodies, hydrothermal circulation induced by magma intrusion, exhumation and erosion) and quantifies the thermal and exhumation history of a given igneous intrusion directly from measured geo-/thermochronometry data. The complete thermal history of igneous bodies includes magmatic cooling and exhumation cooling. Numeric modeling indicates that the magmatic cooling of igneous bodies is complicated but can be further divided into two distinct stages. In the first stage the igneous body cools rapidly while the ambient country rock is simultaneously heated, and this stage is characterized by a very high cooling rate; during the second, longer duration cooling stage, both the igneous body and the ambient country rock cool slowly until they reach a final thermal equilibrium. The exhumation cooling stage is primarily controlled by erosion and exhumation processes. The cooling of igneous bodies is affected by many factors but intrusion size and emplacement depth are the principal controls on the cooling rate and the duration of the two magmatic cooling stages. Combined models for magmatic and exhumation cooling provide a complete digitized thermal history curve which can then be constrained using apatite (U-Th)/He, zircon (U-Th)/He, and zircon U-Pb age data. The digitized temperature-age curve defines the time and depth of emplacement, crystallization age intervals for mineralised zones, cooling rate, "cooled" and exposure ages, and exhumation/erosion rate for the ore deposit. The validity of the curve generated by the inverse thermal modeling routine is demonstrated using age data obtained from the Sar Cheshmeh porphyry copper deposit in Iran. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The study concentrates on a quantitative evaluation of the processes controlling late-orogenic extension and destruction of the Variscides, particularly the gravitational instability of thickened crust. Modelling results suggest that gravitational forces along cannot reproduce the observed timing and amount of Permo-Carboniferous crustal thinning. Tensile plate-boundary forces are required in addition to gravitation to restore a crustal thickness of approximately 30rkm in the Variscan Internides. Stresses as little as 10rMPa result in up to 28% extension and a good fit between observed data and model predictions. It is concluded that the Stephanian to Rotliegend evolution in the vicinity of the modelled traverse resulted not from gravitational forces inherited from Variscan crustal thickening, but was related to a change in orientation of the plate-boundary stresses at the end of the Westphalian.},

Regional heat flow increases from a value of 66 +/- 4 mW/m2 to the north of Menorca to 88 +/- 4 mW/m2 in the southern part of the rift between Valencia and Ibiza. A simple rifting model, assuming uniform stretching of the lithosphere during a single rifting event from 28 to 22 Ma ago, satisfactorily describes the observed heat flow and depth to sea floor in the northern part of the trough. In contrast, the southern Valencia trough has high heat flow and shallow sea floor that are difficult to reconcile with predictions of a uniform lithospheric stretching model even allowing for an initial elevation, a thin, hot lithosphere or a multi-episode history of rifting. Non-homogeneous lithospheric stretching models, assuming for example large-scale dike intrusion or a greater extension of the mantle than in the crust, provide potential explanations of the high heat flow and shallow sea floor in the southern Valencia trough.

Motivation, course, and timing of this transformation, however, remain debatable. Here we present annually resolved and absolutely dated dendroarchaeological information from four wooden water wells of the early Neolithic period that were excavated in Eastern Germany. A total of 151 oak timbers preserved in a waterlogged environment were dated between 5469 and 5098 BC and reveal unexpectedly refined carpentry skills. The recently discovered water wells enable for the first time a detailed insight into the earliest wood architecture and display the technological capabilities of humans $\sim$7000 years ago. The timbered well constructions made of old oak trees feature an unopened tree-ring archive from which annually resolved and absolutely dated environmental data can be culled. Our results question the principle of continuous evolutionary development in prehistoric technology, and contradict the common belief that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions.

abstract = {This paper provides a summary overview of the current state-of-art in the radiocarbon dating of groundwater. While the use of natural 14C measurements in applied hydrogeology still presents a difficult challenge, meaningful dates can be achieved if they are determined and interpreted in conjunction with the analyses of other isotopic species that occur in the natural environment. Although 14C dating of groundwater can be, and often is, carried out as a matter of routine, any specific case study requires its own scientific design and effort. As is widely recognized, and discussed in considerable detail through- out the scientific literature, there are many hydrogeochemical reactions and/or physical processes that can alter the natural 14C enrichment measured in environmental materials. Fortunately, for fresh groundwater resources such effects are in general well defined and therefore of limited significance. The primary challenge in applied groundwater dating is with the develop- ment of the appropriate theoretical background against which 14C dates can be used to calibrate numerical analogues of the groundwater system. The hydraulic properties of each of the widely used finite-element models can be well estimated from numerous piezometric data and extrapolations. In contrast, only a few groundwater ages can be provided for the calibration of those models that are complex functions of aging mixture and sometimes also hydrochemical reactions.},

(2002)) are expanded to accommodate the effects of a- emission and zonation of U and Th as relevant for (U–Th)/He thermochronology. Expressions for the required coefficients are derived for spheres, finite and infinite cylinders and rectangular blocks, for parent nuclide distributions, which are either uniform or have stepwise zoning. We show that the effects of a-emission and zonation on the He retention in a nonspherical crystal of modest aspect ratio can be approximated by a sphere of identical surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) if the zonation is transposed on to the sphere. The currently usual correction method is to perform first a diffusive calculation without considering a-emission and zonation and to multiply afterward with a correction factor that has been derived originally for nondiffusive calculations. Our results demonstrate that more accurate calculations yield different results and that the differences are often too large to be ignored in practice. Especially for thermal histories that include a protracted residence in the partial retention zone, the difference between the usual correction and our correction can be as high as f20% for homogeneous sources. For zoned crystals, the difference can be even larger.},

abstract = {The Pliocene-Holocene Newer Volcanic Province in Victoria, southeast Australia, is a wide volcanic field site of the most recent volcanic activity of Australia. The intraplate signature and the localization on the northern side of the Southern Ocean have been used in the past to ascribe the volcanic activity either to the presence of a mantle hot spot or to thermal anomalies inherited from the seafloor spreading that separated Australia from Antarctica during the Gondwana breakup. The spacing and distribution of groups of eruption points suggests the presence of a 32 km deep mantle thermal anomaly. Alignments of eruption points indicate a strong tectonic control on magma emplacement mainly along NW-SE Mesozoic-Cenozoic structures and along N-S Palaeozoic and E-W Late Cretaceous structures. This volcano tectonic setting relates to the interference of the left-lateral kinematics of the major N-S trending faults associated with the Tasman Fracture Zone and the extensional structures of the Otway basin. This interpretation is also coherent with stress in situ data and focal mechanisms of earthquakes (SHmax oriented N150°). This interpretation enhances the role of the Tasman Fracture Zone, a major sinistral transform, on the reactivation of transtensional structures, and on triggering the magmatism of the Newer Volcanic Province.},

abstract = {Constraints on the structure of rifted continental margins and the
magmatism resulting from such rifting can help refine our understanding
of the strength of the lithosphere, the state of the underlying mantle
and the transition from rifting to seafloor spreading. An important
structural classification of rifts is by width(1), with narrow rifts
thought to form as necking instabilities(2) ( where extension rates
outpace thermal diffusion(3)) and wide rifts thought to require a
mechanism to inhibit localization, such as lower-crustal flow in high
heat-flow settings(1,4). Observations of the magmatism that results
from rifting range from volcanic margins with two to three times the
magmatism predicted from melting models(5) to non-volcanic margins with
almost no rift or post-rift magmatism. Such variations in magmatic
activity are commonly attributed to variations in mantle temperature.
Here we describe results from the PESCADOR seismic experiment in the
southern Gulf of California and present crustal-scale images across
three rift segments. Over short lateral distances, we observe large
differences in rifting style and magmatism - from wide rifting with
minor synchronous magmatism to narrow rifting in magmatically robust
segments. But many of the factors believed to control structural
evolution and magmatism during rifting ( extension rate, mantle
potential temperature and heat flow) tend to vary over larger length
scales. We conclude instead that mantle depletion, rather than low
mantle temperature, accounts for the observed wide, magma-poor margins,
and that mantle fertility and possibly sedimentary insulation, rather
than high mantle temperature, account for the observed robust rift and
post-rift magmatism.},

abstract = {Uplift of sedimentary rocks is accompanied by a wide range of physical and chemical changes that contribute to diagenesis and modify fluid flow regimes. Topography becomes a major driving force behind fluid flow patterns, and meteoric water may penetrate to several kilometres below the surface. Typical diagenetic processes include alteration and leaching of feldspars and other unstable minerals, precipitation of iron oxides and kaolin, and leaching of carbonate and sulphate cements. Reservoired oil may be degraded by near-surface waters, but reservoir rocks may become more oil-wet.Brittle fracturing is enhanced near the surface, and fluid flow may become predominantly fracture-bound as fractures dilate. Uplift also causes tilting of fluid contacts and remigration of hydrocarbons. Exsolution and expansion of gas similarly causes remigration of oil to peripheral traps.Although basin uplift is generally regarded as being detrimental to hydrocarbon prospectivity, especially as a result of breaching of traps, there is also an enhanced potential for hydrocarbon plays based on reserves of exsolved gas, condensate dropout, peripheral traps and fractured reservoirs. },

abstract = {on the erroneous conception, borrowed from the theory of the flow of the ideal frictionless fluids of classical hydrodynamics, that ground-water motion is derivable from a velocity potential. This conception is in conformity with the principle of the conservation of matter but not with that of the conservation of energy. In the present paper it is shown that a more exceptionless analytical theory results if a potential whose value at a given point is defined to be equal to the work required to transform a unit mass of fluid from an arbitrary standard state to the state at the point in question is employed. Denoting this function by 4, it is shown that the differential equation of fluid flow in an isotropic medium is given by q = -o grad 4, where q is the flow vector whose magnitude is equal to the volume of fluid crossing a unit of area normal to the flow direction in unit time, and a a specific conductivity parameter depending upon both the properties of the fluid and the medium. This is an expression of Darcy's law and is physically, as well as mathematically, analogous to Ohm's law in electricity and leads to the same deductions in analogous situations. The existing analytical treatments of ground-water flow have mostly been founded law as just expressed, with particular regard for the practical problems of ground- water hydrology. the geometrical properties of the medium only and p and t are the density and viscosity, respectively, of the fluid. The remainder of the paper is devoted to deducing the consequences of Darcy's},

Since a significant proportion of the crustal complement of HPEs is contained within granites, granite generation and emplacement should lead to significant long-term changes in the thermal structure of the crust. Using HPE concentrations appropriate to representative Australian Proterozoic granites we show that granite segregation leads to changes in the temperature field of the crust of up to c. 50 oC, producing long-term cooling in the source regions and heating at emplacement levels, relative to the pre-granite conductive thermal regime. Because of the intimate connection between thermal regime and lithospheric strength, granite-assisted redistribution of HPEs is likely to be fundamental to cratonisation.},

abstract = {Northwestern Europe is tectonically more active, in terms of seismicity, vertical motions and volcanism, than would be expected from its location far from any plate boundaries. In the context of the Netherlands Earth System Dynamics Initiative, we investigated the implications of two recent modeling efforts, of Eurasian plate forces and European mantle structure, for our understanding of the dynamics of these intraplate tectonics. We find that: (1) a simple balance between ridge push and collision forces along the southern European boundary does not seem sufficient to explain the observed direction of maximum horizontal compression in northwestern Europe. Our stress model, which imposes dynamical equilibrium on the full Eurasian plate, predicts that collision forces along the African-European boundary are relatively weak and have only a minor effect on the stress field in northwestern Europe; (2) seismic velocity anomalies in the shallow mantle imply 100-300[degree sign]C variations in temperature under northwestern Europe. This regional mantle structure probably plays a significant role in the high level of intraplate tectonic activity and the regional variations in stress and tectonic style. For most tectonically active areas in Europe, observed surface heat flow anomalies coincide with anomalies in mantle velocity. Low velocity anomalies under northwestern Europe coincide with areas of recent volcanism and uplift, but are offset from the regions of maximum surface heat flow. This suggests that the thermal regime of the central European lithosphere is not in a steady state, probably due to changing mantle conditions. The effect of strong variations in lithospheric strength, predicted from the modeled thermal gradients in the shallow mantle, and of dynamic stresses induced by proposed active mantle upwellings may account for (some of) the differences between the observed and modeled stress field and will be investigated in future stress models.},

abstract = {Regional geological studies in southeastern Missouri have made a significant contribution to knowledge of the origin of Mississippi Valley-type mineralization and the late diagenetic history of sedimentary rocks throughout this part of the Midcontinent. In addition to mineral exploration, investigations such as these provide insights into basinal processes such as migration and distribution of petroleum, dolomitization, and porosity modification of carbonate petroleum reservoir rocks. Cathodoluminescent microstratigraphies of epigenetic dolomite cements indicate that mineralizing basinal fluids altered carbonate rocks over a much larger area than was affected by sulfide mineralization. Trace element distributions in southeast Missouri also indicate that sedimentary rocks, over a large region, were altered by basinal fluids from both a southern (Arkoma Basin) and a northern or northeastern (possibly the Illinois Basin) source. Fluid inclusions in sphalerites and dolomites throughout southern Missouri and northern Arkansas indicate that mineralizing basinal brines were very saline (≈16 wt % equiv. NaCl] and warm (≈80° to 150°C). The lack of discernible thermal gradients in fluid inclusion temperatures from regionally extensive epigenetic dolomites and the range of fluid inclusion salinities indicate that more than one basinal fluid was involved in dolomitization and associated Pb−Zn ore deposition. Carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of dolomites show that basinal fluids evolved in chemical compositions with time and indicate interactions of fluids from at least two sources. Studies of strontium compositions of dolomite cements south and east of the Viburnum Trend subdistrict provide further evidence of an Arkoma-Ouachita source of one of these fluids. Lead isotope compositions of galenas, however, indicate multiple sources: 1) the Illinois Basin, 2) the Arkoma Basin, 3) and the underlying local granitic basement. Distinct northern and southern basinal sources are postulated for sulfur based on sulfur isotope data from galenas. Taken as a whole, available geochemical and petrographic evidence indicate that dolomitization and Pb−Zn mineralization in southeast Missouri were the result of a more complex, multiple-basin fluid interaction than previously recognized.},

abstract = {Abstract The sediments of the Upper Cretaceous to lower Palaeogene Chalk Group were deposited through a wide range of depositional processes. Chalk was originally formed by settlement of coccolithophorid skeletal remains from suspension in the water column, with bottom currents redistributing the sediment shortly after deposition. Locally, tilting of the sea-floor resulted in mass-movement of chalk at scales varying from decimetre-thick turbidites to slumps and slide sheets that were up to hundreds of metres thick. Syn-depositional tectonic activity, therefore, constituted an important control on chalk facies. To study this relation in more detail, a three-dimensional (3D)-seismic stratigraphical analysis was carried out, comparing two study areas that experienced contrasting syn-depositional tectonic evolutions. The Vlieland offshore area, which underwent gradual subsidence and westward tilting during deposition of the Chalk Group, is characterised by parallel and continuous reflections thought to represent pelagic chalk deposits. In the Dutch Central Graben, which was tectonically inverted during the Late Cretaceous to early Palaeogene, discontinuous and irregular seismic reflections that indicate large-scale reworking of sediment are found. The improved image quality of 3D- vs. 2D-seismic data allowed us to study the detailed geometry of allochthonous chalk bodies and aided the identification and tracing of the often subtle intra-Chalk Group unconformities, resulting in a subdivision of the Chalk Group into seven seismic sequences.},

abstract = {The forces that drove rock uplift of the low-relief, high-elevation, tectonically stable Colorado Plateau are the subject of long-standing debate(1-5). While the adjacent Basin and Range province and Rio Grande rift province underwent Cenozoic shortening followed by extension(6), the plateau experienced similar to 2km of rock uplift(7) without significant internal deformation(2-4). Here we propose that warming of the thicker, more iron-depleted Colorado Plateau lithosphere(8-10) over 35-40 Myr following mid-Cenozoic removal of the Farallon plate from beneath North America(11,12) is the primary mechanism driving rock uplift. In our model, conductive re-equilibration not only explains the rock uplift of the plateau, but also provides a robust geodynamic interpretation of observed contrasts between the Colorado Plateau margins and the plateau interior. In particular, the model matches the encroachment of Cenozoic magmatism from the margins towards the plateau interior at rates of 3-6 km Myr(-1) and is consistent with lower seismic velocities(13) and more negative Bouguer gravity(14) at the margins than in the plateau interior. We suggest that warming of heterogeneous lithosphere is a powerful mechanism for driving epeirogenic rock uplift of the Colorado Plateau and may be of general importance in plate-interior settings.},

abstract = {Steady and transient flow models for regional brine migration have been constructed for quantifying the role of groundwater in the genesis of carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits in the U.S. Midcontinent region. Earlier theor. studies suggested that ores of the Mississippi Valley type formed as deep groundwater was driven out of basins and onto platform margins by elevated topog. (G. Garven and R. A. Freeze, 1984a, b). Several basins surround the major ore districts of the Midcontinent region, but it was the tectonic uplift after the Alleghenian orogeny of Late Pennsylvanian time that created the topog. necessary for driving brines out of the basins and onto the adjacent domes where the ore deposits formed. A typical paleohydrol. reconstruction extending across the Arkoma basin and onto the Ozark dome shows that Cambrian-Ordovician strata acted as regional aquifers in focusing metal-bearing brines at Darcy flow rates of 1.0 to 5.0 m/yr in topog.-driven flow systems. Ore mineralization assocd. with topog.-driven flow occurred in less than a few million years at 80¬∞-130¬∞ in broad discharge areas in southeastern Missouri, although much warmer thermal transients may have lasted for ‚{\`{a}}{\textordmasculine}100,000 yr. Geothermal gradients in discharge areas were strongly elevated by regional flow assocd. with foreland uplift, yet lateral temps. gradients are predicted to have been very small in the platform aquifers. Other hydrogeol. simulations predicted similar broad discharge areas in southern Wisconsin and southern Illinois with transient temps. of ore formation of 150¬∞-220¬∞ because of brine movement through the deep Illinois Basin and Reelfoot Rift, resp. Alleghenian uplift of the Appalachians evolved such that paleorelief probably reached a max. first in the northeast and then migrated south, culminating with subaerial exposure of the Ouachita fold belt and Arkoma platform. Based on this tectonic interpretation, fluid migration pathways are likely to have varied considerably throughout the Late Paleozoic.},

abstract = {A key component of sedimentary basin evolution is the spatial distribution and temporal variation of stress and deformation. The many deformation processes (poroelasticity, fracturing, irreversible nonlinear viscosity, and pressure solution) are inextricably bound in a tightly coupled network which, in turn, is coupled to a myriad of basin diagenetic, thermal and hydrologic processes. In the approach presented here, the various deformation processes are integrated through an incremental stress approach. Together with mass, momentum and energy conservation, this approach yields a complete, fully coupled basin model that captures basin and fault phenomena that are beyond the scope of simpler or decoupled models. Many of the most interesting basin phenomena are not only dependent on multiple, coupled processes but also are fundamentally three-dimensional. To address this three-dimensional complexity, we have developed a numerical simulator using a moving, adapting, accreting finite element grid which is allowed to deform and to grow and adapt with the addition of sediment to capture smaller sedimentary features. As a result, our fully coupled, comprehensive model allows one to solve a number of key problems in basin and fault dynamics. These include compaction, fractured reservoir and compartment genesis and dynamics. Examples illustrating these applications are presented for idealized systems and the Piceance Basin (Colorado) and the Permian Basin (West Texas). The incremental stress rheology is found to be a powerful formalism for integrating basin hydrology, diagenesis and mechanics.},

abstract = {A land surface hydrology parameterization for use in atmospheric GCMs is presented. The parameterization incorporates subgrid scale variability in topography, soils, soil moisture and precipita- tion. The framework of the model is the statistical distribution of a topography-soils index, which controls the local water balance fluxes, and is therefore taken to represent the large land area. Spatially variable water balance fluxes are integrated with respect to the topography-soils index to yield our large scale parameterizations: water balance calculations are performed for a number of intervals of the topography-soils distribution, and interval responses are weighted by the probability of occurrence of the interval. Grid square averaged land surface fluxes result. The model functions independently as a macroscale water balance model. Runoff ratio and evapotranspiration efficiency parameterizations are derived and are shown to depend on the spatial variability of the above mentioned properties and processes, as well at the dynamics of land surface-atmosphere interactions.},

abstract = {It is well known that significant corrections to measured heat-flow values are required in limited areas that have been subjected to the advance and retreat of ice sheets. However, important activities such as the Wisconsin glacial cycle must have been accompanied by temperature changes of global extent. Therefore, even those continental areas that were not subject to glaciation may have suffered important mean surface temperature changes, thus leading to the need to correct heat-flow measurements made in such areas. Furthermore, there have been significant widespread changes in climate during the Holocene, leading to a need to correct for short-term temperature changes as well. Applying corrections to existing data for a surface thermal history of the Holocene and Pleistocene, it is found that correlation between heat-flow values and borehole depths are significantly reduced, that both positive and negative correlations of heat flow with conductivity may be due to neglect of climatic corrections, and that many heat-flow values, particularly from shallow holes (less than 400 meters deep), may need corrections of several tenths of a heat-flow unit (several mW m-2). It is concluded that mean heat-flow values for heat-flow provinces, and continents as a whole, may be too low by as much as 20 or 30% and that the mean oceanic and continental heat-flow values may not be equal.},

abstract = {A mathematical framework for quantitative evaluation of alpha-stopping effects on (U-Th)/ He ages has been developed. Alpha stopping ranges in the 238U, 235U, and 232Th chains vary between >10 and ???30 ??m, depending on decay energy and density/composition of the stopping medium. In the case of U-and Th-rich accessory minerals (e.g. apatite, zircon, titanite), the dominant effect of long stopping distances is alpha ejection to adjacent minerals. For grains smaller than a few hundred microns in minimum dimension, ejection effects will cause measured helium ages to substantially underestimate true ages. For example, a sphere of 100 ??m radius retains only ???82% of its alphas. For a homogeneous distribution of parent nuclides, the fraction of alphas ejected is ???1/4 of the mean alpha range multiplied by the crystal surface to volume ratio, independent of geometry. Removal of the outer 20 ??m of a crystal prior to dating eliminates the region which has experienced alpha loss, but may lead to erroneous ages when crystals are strongly zoned with respect to uranium and thorium. By careful characterization of four sieved apatite separates from a single sample, we show that it is possible to accurately correct (U-Th)/He ages for alpha ejection even when ejection exceeds 35% of total decays. Our results are useful for identifying the size and shape of grains which are best suited for (U-Th)/He dating and provide the basis for correcting ages when ejection effects are significant. This work underscores that meaningful (U-Th)/He ages require either large crystals, or correction of measured ages for alpha ejection.},

This chapter considers seismicity‐induced fault‐permeability changes and their effects on hot‐spring/geyser isotopic composition over timescales of 103 years within the Beowawe geothermal system, Nevada, USA. In order to interpret the stable‐isotope history of the sinter deposit and the present‐day temperature trends, the chapter also considers a relatively simple, cross‐sectional, single‐phase hydrothermal model of the Beowawe geothermal system. In this model, permeability is instantaneously increased along the Muleshoe and Malpais fault zones to create a single‐pass hydrothermal system. The pollen 14C age and oxygen isotopic composition of siliceous sinter deposits from the former Beowawe geyser field reveal evidence of two hydrothermal discharge events that followed relatively low‐magnitude (<M5) earthquakes of Holocene and Late Pleistocene age along the Malpais fault zone in Whirlwind Valley, Nevada.},

abstract = {The Central European Basin System (CEBS) is composed of a series of subbasins, the largest of which are (1) the Norwegian-Danish Basin (2), the North German Basin extending westward into the southern North Sea and (3) the Polish Basin. A 3D structural model of the CEBS is presented, which integrates the thickness of the crust below the Permian and five layers representing the Permian-Cenozoic sediments. Structural interpretations derived from the 3D model and from backstripping are discussed with respect to published seismic data. The analysis of structural relationships across the CEBS suggests that basin evolution was controlled to a large degree by the presence of major zones of crustal weakness. The NW-SE-striking Tornquist Zone, the Ringkobing-Fyn High (RFH) and the Elbe Fault System (EFS) provided the borders for the large Permo-Mesozoic basins, which developed along axes parallel to these fault systems. The Tornquist Zone, as the most prominent of these zones, limited the area affected by Permian-Cenozoic subsidence to the north. Movements along the Tornquist Zone, the margins of the Ringkobing-Fyn High and the Elbe Fault System could have influenced basin initiation. Thermal destabilization of the crust between the major NW-SE-striking fault systems, however, was a second factor controlling the initiation and subsidence in the Permo-Mesozoic basins. In the Triassic, a change of the regional stress field caused the formation of large grabens (Central Graben, Horn Graben, Gluckstadt Graben) perpendicular to the Tornquist Zone, the Ringkobing-Fyn High and the Elbe Fault System. The resulting subsidence pattern can be explained by a superposition of declining thermal subsidence and regional extension. This led to a dissection of the Ringkobing-Fyn High, resulting in offsets of the older NW-SE elements by the younger N-S elements. In the Late Cretaceous, the NW-SE elements were reactivated during compression, the direction of which was such that it did not favour inversion of N-S elements. A distinct change in subsidence controlling factors led to a shift of the main depocentre to the central North Sea in the Cenozoic. In this last phase, N-S-striking structures in the North Sea and NW-SE-striking structures in The Netherlands are reactivated as subsidence areas which are in line with the direction of present maximum compression. The Moho topography below the CEBS varies over a wide range. Below the N-S-trending Cenozoic depocentre in the North Sea, the crust is only 20 km thick compared to about 30 km below the largest part of the CEBS. The crust is up to 40 km thick below the Ringkobing-Fyn High and up to 45 km along the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone. Crustal thickness gradients are present across the Tornquist Zone and across the borders of the Ringkobing-Fyn High but not across the Elbe Fault System. The N-S-striking structural elements are generally underlain by a thinner crust than the other parts of the CEBS. The main fault systems in the Permian to Cenozoic sediment fill of the CEBS are located above zones in the deeper crust across which a change in geophysical properties as P-wave velocities or gravimetric response is observed. This indicates that these structures served as templates in the crustal memory and that the prerift configuration of the continental crust is a major controlling factor for the subsequent basin evolution.},

abstract = {Groundwater recharge at Mt. Hood, Oregon, is dominated by spring snow melt which provides a natural large-amplitude and narrow-width pore-fluid pressure signal. Time delays between this seasonal groundwater recharge and seismicity triggered by groundwater recharge can thus be used to estimate large-scale hydraulic diffusivities and the state of stress in the crust. We approximate seasonal variations in groundwater recharge with discharge in runoff-dominated streams at high elevations. We interpolate the time series of number of earthquakes, N, seismic moment, Mo, and stream discharge, Q, and determine cross-correlation coefficients at equivalent frequency bands between Q and both N and Mo. We find statistically significant correlation coefficients at a mean time lag of about 151 days. This time lag and a mean earthquake depth of about 4.5 km are used in the solution to the pressure diffusion equation, under periodic (1 year) boundary conditions, to estimate a hydraulic diffusivity of ?? ??? 10-1 m2/s, a hydraulic conductivity of about Kh ??? 10-7 m/s, and a permeability of about k ??? 10-15 m2. Periodic boundary conditions also allow us to determine a critical pore-fluid pressure fraction, P???/P0 ??? 0.1, of the applied near-surface pore-fluid pressure perturbation, P0 ??? 0.1 MPa, that has to be reached at the mean earthquake depth to cause hydroseismicity. The low magnitude of P??? ??? 0.01 MPa is consistent with other studies that propose 0.01 ??? P??? ??? 0.1 MPa and suggests that the state of stress in the crust near Mt. Hood could be near critical for failure. Therefore, we conclude that, while earthquakes occur throughout the year at Mt. Hood, elevated seismicity levels along pre-existing faults south of Mt.

abstract = {The present paper investigates the hydraulic conditions which could perturb a palaeoclimatically induced temperature signal in the underground. By a series of forward model analysis the behaviour of a Pleistocene Ice-Age-induced surface temperature change is analysed. It is shown that even at high Darcy fluid velocities of 5 x 10-8 m s-1 the transient temperature wave remains preserved although altering its shape with depth and amplitude. The forward results were later on analysed by a backward process which inverts the temperature signal and ideally should reproduce the given temperature history. Since the inversion routine assumes pure diffusive conditions in a 1-D horizontally layered medium, large deviations did show up in the case of an advectively influenced subsurface. A proposed correction strategy, reducing the borehole temperature logs first for their steady-state advective component before applying the inversion process yields much smaller deviations and reasonable climatic signals even for Darcy fluid velocities of 10-8 m s-1. Knowing that a palaeoclimatic temperature signal must be visible in subsurface, an earlier steady-state thermal study of the German Continental Deep Drilling Project has been improved. The actual successful forward fitting process accounts for advection, topography, lithological heterogeneities and a transient temperature signal induced by surface temperature changes. The last temperature log could be excellently fitted with a maximum temperature difference of only 0.3 K between 300 m and 3000 m. The model assumptions required a realistic distribution of the main lithologies. In the considered depth range the temperature field at KTB is strongly dominated by palaeoclimatic effects and by lithological heterogeneities. Thermal advection seems to be visible but of secondary importance only.},

abstract = {The internal structures of the Wattle Gully Fault provide insights about the mechanics and dynamics of fault systems exhibiting fault valve behavior in high fluid pressure regimes. This small, high-angle reverse fault zone developed at temperatures near 300�C in the upper crust, late during mid-Devonian regional crustal shortening in central Victoria, Australia. The Wattle Gully Fault forms part of a network of faults that focused upward migration of fluids generated by metamorphism and devolatilisation at deeper crustal levels. The fault has a length of around 800 m and a maximum displacement of 50 m and was oriented at 60� to 80� to the maximum principal stress during faulting. The structure was therefore severely misoriented for frictional reactivation. This factor, together with the widespread development of steeply dipping fault fill quartz veins and associated subhorizontal extension veins within the fault zone, indicates that faulting occurred at low shear stresses and in a near-lithostatic fluid pressure regime. The internal structures of these veins, and overprinting relationships between veins and faults, indicate that vein development was intimately associated with faulting and involved numerous episodes of fault dilatation and hydrothermal sealing and slip, together with repeated hydraulic extension fracturing adjacent to slip surfaces. The geometries, distribution and internal structures of veins in the Wattle Gully Fault Zone are related to variations in shear stress, fluid pressure, and near-field principal stress orientations during faulting. Vein opening is interpreted to have been controlled by repeated fluid pressure fluctuations associated with cyclic, deformation-induced changes in fault permeability during fault valve behavior. Rates of recovery of shear stress and fluid pressure after rupture events are interpreted to be important factors controlling time dependence of fault shear strength and slip recurrence. Fluctuations in shear stress and transient rotations of near-field principal Stresses, indicated by vein geometries, are interpreted to indicate at least local near-total relief of shear stress during some rupture events. Fault valve behavior has important effects on the dynamics of fluid migration around active faults that are sites of focused fluid migration. In particular, fault valve action is expected to lead to distinctly different fluid migration patterns adjacent to faults before, and immediately after, rupture. These fluid migration patterns have important differences with those predicted by models for dilatancy-diffusion effects and for poroelastic responses around reverse faults.},

abstract = {The width of a mixing zone between freshwater and seawater is important primarily because it directly reflects the extent of mixing and the growth and decay of the mixing zone indicates changes of the flow regime and water exchange between freshwater and coastal seawater. Wide mixing zones have been found in many coastal aquifers all over the world. However, the mechanisms responsible for wide mixing zones are not well understood. This work examines the hypothesis that kinetic mass transfer coupled with transient conditions, which create the movement of the mixing zone, may widen mixing zones in coastal aquifers. The hypothesis is tested by conducting two-dimensional numerical simulations based on a variable-density groundwater model for a scaled-tank model and a field-scale model. Periodic water levels, representing periodic tidal motion and freshwater table fluctuations, are imposed at the seaward and landward boundary, respectively, which cause the movement of the mixing zone. Both the scaled-tank model and the field model show that the combination of the moving mixing zone and kinetic mass transfer may significantly enhance the extent of mixing and create a wider mixing zone than the models without kinetic mass transfer. In addition, sensitivity analyses indicate that a larger capacity ratio (immobile porosity/mobile porosity) of mass transfer leads to a wider mixing zone, and the maximum width of the mixing zone may be reached for a given capacity ratio when the mean retention time scale in the immobile domain (the reciprocal of mass transfer rate) and the period of water level fluctuations are comparable.},

abstract = {The specific time window of apatite fission track thermochronology (AFTT) places it in a unique position to offer continuous time–temperature baseline histories for relatively stable shield, rift and passive margin environments, spanning several geological eras. Fission tracks anneal partially at temperatures between ap110 °C and ap60 °C and thereby provide information on residence times within specific levels of the crust. Most samples collected from these terrains, however, are usually found to have cooled out of the apatite partial annealing zone (APAZ) by the mid-Cenozoic at the latest. Owing to the stability, at geological timescales, of tracks at temperatures \textless60 °C (i.e. within depths of 0–2.5 km at normal geothermal gradients), a significant loss of resolution must therefore be reckoned with at shallow, although geomorphologically crucial, crustal depths. Indeed, the Neogene and Quaternary are understood to have been most influential in generating the scenery of today, and a use of radiometric and stratigraphic techniques in a nested, multisystem approach can assist in bridging the resolution gap. This paper examines and illustrates, mostly with original examples, the uses and limitations of AFTT in addressing the response of Earth surface systems to event patterns in global tectonics, the controls of lithology and structure on denudation rates, the origin and evolution of passive margin escarpments, the mass-balanced reconstruction of palaeoelief, the use of apatites as tracers for understanding provenance in sediment routing systems, and the tempo (or episodicity) of denudation as postulated by W. M. Davis' canons of the ‘geographical cycle'. Alongside efforts towards standardizing the supply of analytically robust AFT results in the laboratory, a more standardized geoscientific interpretation of AFT data is also desirable in order to build a consistent world base of geomorphic rates which can be made available to – and used with confidence by – non-AFTT specialists.},

abstract = {Water availability on the continents is important for human health, economic activity, ecosystem function and geophysical processes. Because the saturation vapour pressure of water in air is highly sensitive to temperature, perturbations in the global water cycle are expected to accompany climate warming. Regional patterns of warming-induced changes in surface hydroclimate are complex and less certain than those in temperature, however, with both regional increases and decreases expected in precipitation and runoff. Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow. These models project 10-40% increases in runoff in eastern equatorial Africa, the La Plata basin and high-latitude North America and Eurasia, and 10-30% decreases in runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and mid-latitude western North America by the year 2050. Such changes in sustainable water availability would have considerable regional-scale consequences for economies as well as ecosystems.},

The presence of a radiogenic helium component leads to 3He4He ratios below that of atmospheric helium (minimum $\delta$3He values ≈ -60%) below about 20 m depth. The 3He profile can be corrected for the nucleogenic 3He component using the neon measurements. Based on the "Vogel" model of a shallow aquifer the tritium/3He distributions are simulated for the years 1987, 2000 and 2025. The model results show that under favourable conditions the tritiogenic 3He peak will be detectable in shallow aquifers for at least the next 4 decades. The influence of the vertical flow velocity and the transversal dispersion coefficient on simulated distributions are estimated. 3He confinement is calculated as a function of the vertical flow velocity and the transversal dispersion coefficient. There is a critical value of the vertical flow velocity (about 0.25-0.5 m/year) below which the 3He loss increases rapidly to high values. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Radiogenic heat production (RHP) represents a significant fraction of surface heat flow, both on cratons and in sedimentary basins. RHP within continental crust—especially the upper crust—is high. RHP at any depth within the crust can be estimated as a function of crustal age. Mantle RHP, in contrast, is always low, contributing at most 1 to 2 mW/m2 to total heat flow. Radiogenic heat from any noncrystalline basement that may be present also contributes to total heat flow. RHP from metamorphic rocks is similar to or slightly lower than that from their precursor sedimentary rocks. When extension of the lithosphere occurs—as for example during rifting—the radiogenic contribution of each layer of the lithosphere and noncrystalline basement diminishes in direct proportion to the degree of extension of that layer. Lithospheric RHP today is somewhat less than in the distant past, as a result of radioactive decay. In modeling, RHP can be varied through time by considering the half lives of uranium, thorium, and potassium, and the proportional contribution of each of those elements to total RHP from basement. RHP from sedimentary rocks ranges from low for most evaporites to high for some shales, especially those rich in organic matter. The contribution to total heat flow of radiogenic heat from sediments depends strongly on total sediment thickness, and thus differs through time as subsidence and basin filling occur. RHP can be high for thick clastic sections. RHP in sediments can be calculated using ordinary or spectral gamma-ray logs, or it can be estimated from the lithology.},

abstract = {Clay minerals are perhaps the most abundant materials in the earth's upper crust. As such, their elastic properties are extremely important in seismic exploration, seismic reservoir characterization, and sonic-log interpretation. Because little exists in the literature on elastic properties of clays, we have designed a method of measuring effective elastic properties of solid clays (clays without pores). In this method, clay minerals are mixed with a material with known elastic properties to make composite samples. Elastic properties of these clay minerals are then inverted from the measured elastic properties of the composite samples using the weighted Hashin-Shtrikman average.Using this method, we have measured 66 samples of 16 types of clays. In this paper, we present a comprehensive data set of elastic properties of solid clays that commonly occur in, or are related to, petroleum reservoirs. Although uncertainties (up to 10%) exist, the data set reported here is by far the most comprehensive set of elastic properties in the literature. These data can be used potentially in modeling the seismic properties of clay-bearing rocks. },

The evolution of the neotectonic strain field deduced from historical seismicity and both onshore and offshore faulting records is used to address the origin of this unusual stress field. Strain rates derived from estimates of the seismic moment release rate (up to ∼10−16 s−1) are compatible with Quaternary fault–slip rates. The record of more or less continuous tectonic activity extends back to the terminal Miocene or early Pliocene (10–5 Ma). Terminal Miocene tectonic activity was characterised by regional-scale tilting and local uplift and erosion, now best preserved by unconformities in offshore basins. Plate-scale stress modelling suggests the in situ stress field reflects increased coupling of the Australian and Pacific Plate boundary in the late Miocene, associated with the formation of the Southern Alps in New Zealand.},

We compare these movements to (a) mean tectonic, isostatic and compaction movements at time scales of millions of years obtained by backstripping of Cenozoic stratigraphy, and (b) estimates of recent ( 100 yr) movements from process modelling of isostasy (glacio- and hydro-isostasy) and compaction. The process rates at time scales of millions of years are insufficient to account for the geodetic observations by an order of magnitude. The isostasy and compaction rates inferred for the last century are also insufficient; they explain less than half of the observed movements. This suggests that the residual – observed rates less isostasy and compaction estimates – which is interpreted to represent tectonic crustal deformation, constitutes an important contribution to present-day movements. The surprisingly high rates of short-term tectonic vertical movements in a region which is relatively inactive, seismically, indicate that correction of tide-gauge records for the glacio-isostatic signal alone does not yield an appropriate measure of eustatic sea-level rise along the Dutch coast.},

abstract = {The late Paleozoic to Tertiary stratigraphic record of much of the African plate reflects the effects of continental rifting and passive margin development. Several short-lived, but widespread and tectonically important, compressional or wrench-dominated events occurred, however, during the Permian to Recent evolution of Africa. We focus here on the best documented of these events, which occurred during the late Santonian. At that time, older sedimentary basins, mostly ENE-WSW trending, were folded and inverted, including some basins along the Tethyan margin from Morocco to the Syrian Arc and the intraplate Benue-southern Chad basins and the Lugh-Mandera basin. In Oman, ophiolites were obducted. Following the Santonian tectonism, an extensive phase of rifting occurred in Central and North Africa and northern Arabia, spanning from Campanian to Maastrichtian or Paleocene times. Rejuvenation or acceleration of subsidence occurred in several basins located along the Tethyan margin, along the Atlantic and Indian Ocean margins, as well as within the intraplate domain. Rifting was sometimes accompanied by magmatic activity, especially in offshore northern Libya and along the Indian Ocean margin. Compressional deformations rejuvenated or developed by latest Maastrichtian times along the Tethyan margin and locally within the intraplate domain. One of the most remarkable attributes of the Santonian tectonic event, which we consider representative of the major trans-African stress field changes, is the rapidity with which the change was reflected stratigraphically across North and Central Africa, and its short duration. The cause of the Santonian compressional event is directly linked to the change in poles of rotation for the opening of the Atlantic at 83-85 Ma, the end of the Cretaceous Normal Magnetic Quiet Zone. This was also synchronous with the obduction of ophiolites along the northeast margin of Arabia (Oman), the onset of separation between India and Madagascar with formation of the Mascarene oceanic basin, and the development of the European Alpine Chain. We interpret these phenomena as causally related aspects of a global tectonic event. The Santonian compressional event, as well as the Campanian-Maastrichtian rifting event and the end Cretaceous compressional event, illustrate the critical connection between intraplate tectonic histories and processes occurring at sometimes very distant plate boundaries.},

abstract = {Pressures of interstitial fluids significantly greater than the normal hydrostatic pressure are known in many parts of the world. Many occurrences are in thick sections of relatively young sediments; some are in areas that have been intensely deformed. Abnormal fluid pressures in the Gulf Coast region are associated with thick bodies of shale or mudstone, and with high hydraulic gradients across bedding. The rocks there have been buried rather rapidly and are evidently not yet fully compacted. The mechanicsm by which clay consolidates under pressure affords a quantitative relationship among the variables--depth, strength of clay, and fluid pressure--and this relationship indicated that the Gulf Coast examples agree fairly well with observations on depth and porosity in Paleozoic shales of Oklahoma and Tertiary shales of Venezuela. Critical data are lacking, but permeability clearly decreases termendously as clay rocks are compacted. This decrease in permeability provides a self-sealing mechanism that greatly retards the escape of pre water from deeply buried clay rocks. The relathionship between rate of compaction and the development of abnormal fluid pressures probably applies not only to clay rocks. Conditions of geosynclinal deposition are, in general, those most favourable to the development of abnormal fluid pressures. The hypothesis that large-scale overthrusting is facilitated by abnormal fluid pressures which, in turn, are associated with geosynclinal deposition is applied to the overthrust belt of western Wyoming and adjacent States. This is a long curving belt of several bedding-plane faults which have an aggregate horizontal displacement across the belt of 50 miles or more. The sedimentary rocks that make up the belt were evidently deposited in a major geosyncline bordered by uplands not far to the west. At any given locality, the rate of deposition of the sediments increased continuously until the beginning of intense deformation and overthrusting. The geosynclinal axis and the bordering uplands probably migrated slowly eastward across the belt. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that abnormal fluid pressures developed in this region during final stages of rapid geosynclinal sinking and that thick plates of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks sheared off from the underlying rocks and moved slowly eastward. Rate of movement probably was controlled by erosion of upfolds that arose at the front of each moving plate. The fundamental cause of the lateral stresses that propelled the overthrusts is not known, but it may be examined instructively in the light of the fluid pressures hypothesis. The thrust sheets might, for example, have slid by simple gravitation down the western limb of the geosyncline on reasonable slopes and not improvavly fluid pressure-overburden ratios. Such large-scale slumping of thrust sheets, however, seems to require gaps at the rear of the thrust sheets. The long intermontane valleys of Idaho and Utah may possibly have originated as such gaps or rifts, but no proof has yet been recognized that they were formed in this manner. An alternative possibility, ragional compression, requires concentration of the lateral stresses within the upper few miles of the earth's crustl in this general region emplacement of the Idaho batholith seems the most likely source of such superficially concentrated stresses. However, this batholith is so far from the front edge of the overthrust belt that it would require extremely high fluid pressure-overburden rations over a wide area. Perhaps some combination of the two forces--pushing wide thrust plates down a gentle slope--is the most likely explanation.},

abstract = {Climate change will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle, creating changes in freshwater resources, land cover and landatmosphere feedbacks. Recent studies have investigated the response of groundwater to climate change but do not account for energy feedbacks across the complete hydrologic cycle1, 2. Although land-surface models have begun to include an operational groundwater-type component3, 4, 5, they do not include physically based lateral surface and subsurface flow and allow only for vertical transport processes. Here we use a variably saturated groundwater flow model with integrated overland flow and land-surface model processes6, 7, 8 to examine the interplay between water and energy flows in a changing climate for the southern Great Plains, USA, an important agricultural region that is susceptible to drought. We compare three scenario simulations with modified atmospheric forcing in terms of temperature and precipitation with a simulation of present-day climate. We find that groundwater depth, which results from lateral water flow at the surface and subsurface, determines the relative susceptibility of regions to changes in temperature and precipitation. This groundwater control is critical to understand processes of recharge and drought in a changingclimate.},

abstract = {Data substantiating perched conditions in layered bedrock uplands are rare and have not been widely reported. Field observations in layered sedimentary bedrock in southwestern Wisconsin, USA, provide evidence of a stable, laterally extensive perched aquifer. Data from a densely instrumented field site show a perched aquifer in shallow dolomite, underlain by a shale-and-dolomite aquitard approximately 25 m thick, which is in turn underlain by sandstone containing a 30-m-thick unsaturated zone above a regional aquifer. Heads in water supply wells indicate that perched conditions extend at least several kilometers into hillsides, which is consistent with published modeling studies. Observations of unsaturated conditions in the sandstone over a 4-year period, historical development of the perched aquifer, and perennial flow from upland springs emanating from the shallow dolomite suggest that perched groundwater is a stable hydrogeologic feature under current climate conditions. Water-table hydrographs exhibit apparent differences in the amount and timing of recharge to the perched and regional flow systems; steep hydraulic gradients and tritium and chloride concentrations suggest there is limited hydraulic connection between the two. Recognition and characterization of perched flow systems have practical importance because their groundwater flow and transport pathways may differ significantly from those in underlying flow systems. Construction of multi-aquifer wells and groundwater withdrawal in perched systems can further alter such pathways.},

abstract = {The first detailed reconstruction of the continental paleoclimate evolution of the Northwest German Tertiary (Late Oligocene to Pliocene) is presented. The paleoclimate data are derived from the paleobotanical record using the coexistence approach, a method recently introduced that employs climatic requirements of the Nearest Living Relatives of a fossil flora. Twenty six megafloras (fruits and seeds, leaves, woods) from the Tertiary succession of the Lower Rhine Basin and neighboring areas are analyzed with respect to ten meteorological parameters. Additionally, two sample sets from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene sediments comprising 396 palynofloras are analyzed by the same method providing a higher temporal resolution. The temperature curves show a comparatively cooler phase in the Late Oligocene, a warm interval the Middle Miocene, and a cooling starting at 14 Ma. The cooling trend persisted until Late Pliocene with a few higher frequency temperature variations observed. From the beginning of Late Miocene to the present, the seasonality increases and climate appears to have been less stable. As indicated by the precipitation data, a Cfa climate with wet summers persisted in NW Germany from Late Oligocene to Late Pliocene. The results obtained are well in accordance with regional and global isotope curves derived from the marine record, and allow for a refined correlation of the Tertiary succession in the Lower Rhine Basin with the international standard. It is shown that the reconstructed data are largely consistent with the continental climate record for the Northern Hemisphere, as reported by various authors. Discrepancies with previous reconstructions are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {The conversion of biogenic silica (opal-A) to opal-CT (cristobalite and tridymite) in biosiliceous sediment causes increased rates of water expulsion because of the reduction in sediment porosity and dehydration of the amorphous opal-A phase. This release of water occurs over large tracts of sedimentary basins during sediment burial within discrete, diagenetic, reaction zones. Analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional seismic data sets from basins in the Northern Hemisphere provides geophysical evidence for a variety of fluid conduits and roughly circular erosional depressions at the contemporaneous seabed. We interpret these features as indicative of water expulsion and focused fluid flow emanating from opal-A to opal-CT reaction zones at burial depths within the range 200-800 m. The rate at which water is expelled depends upon the degree of porosity reduction and the weight fraction of bound water at the reaction zone as well as the rate of advance of the reaction zone. Where the reaction is actively taking place within homogeneous biosiliceous sediment, the rate of water expulsion is independent of the reaction rate. This is because water is released across the entire reaction zone; therefore, slow reaction rates are compensated for by expulsion of water across wider reaction zones. We calculate the rate and volume of water expulsion for the Faeroe-Shetland Basin, where the sediment immediately below the reaction zone contains, on average, [\textasciitilde]30% opal-CT by weight. The estimated volumetric rate of water expulsion per unit surface area at the present day is [\textasciitilde]6 m3 My-1 per square meter, which is greater than the vertical flux of water at the same depth from compaction of the deeper basin fill. The average volumetric rate of water expulsion is [\textasciitilde]120 km3 My-1 across the whole basin. Biogenic silica is particularly rich in Neogene successions in high latitude and equatorial regions, and where silica reaction zones are identified, they should be factored into sediment compaction and fluid-flow histories.},

The helium profile was found to be in steady state with respect to in situ production and diffusive loss into the adjacent limestones where groundwater circulates. From this profile a representative mean value of the apparent diffusion coefficient for helium in the pore water of the whole formation was derived for the first time to be Da = 3.5 × 10−11 m2 {\textperiodcentered} s−1, which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the diffusion coefficient D0 in free water.

An evaluation of the available data of pore fluids indicates an unstable stratification in terms of fluid densities. In order to study the possible physical causes, numerical simulations of coupled fluid, heat and mass flow were carried out at the basin scale. Modelling results suggest a possible presence of thermally induced free convection controlled by spatial heterogeneity in sedimentary-layer thickness and permeability. Specifically, the results point to a situation where the subsurface fluids are generally close to convective instability, with presence of free convection in those regions where a sufficient, vertically continuous permeability exists. Scenarios that allow for a local presence of free convection may be needed to understand the mechanism behind numerous previously unexplained field observations of deep-groundwater occurrences near the basin surface. The potential presence of large-scale convection cells has implications both for the fundamental understanding of basin processes and socio-economic issues.},

Density dependent groundwater flow is modeled in three-dimensions with MOCDENS3D. This computer code is a version of MOC3D (Konikow et al., 1996) that has been adapted to simulate transient density-driven groundwater flow. Results from the model suggests that in this Dutch hydrogeologic system a severe and irreversible salinisation is already occurring. Within a few tens to hundreds of years, the salinity of the shallow aquifer is estimated to increase substantially. This salinisation process is a result of human activities such as the reclamation of the low-lying areas during the past centuries. Without changing the present boundary conditions, seepage into the low-lying areas will decrease slightly because of predicted increases in groundwater salinity. However, the rate in salt load through the Holocene aquitard into the low-lying areas will increase significantly due to an increase in salinity in the shallow aquifer. In addition, a relative sea level rise of 0.5 m per century will intensify the salinisation process, causing an enormous increase in salt load in all low-lying areas in this part of The Netherlands.},

abstract = {A procedure has been devised for predicting the fluid pressures in a sedimentary basin from the distribution of different rock types, and their burial rates. We have calibrated the procedure with case histories from the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Norway and Nile Delta. We show how the procedure is useful for making estimates of the fluid pressures likely to be encountered when drilling a well; the directions of petroleum migration; and the ability of structures to retain oil or gas. The procedure is based on a simple equation which accounts only for the vertical flow of fluids. To include lateral flow, laterally-continuous high permeability layers, such as oil and gas reservoir rocks and aquifers, must be divided into pressure cells. A pressure cell is a part of the layer within which fluids can flow and equalize excess pressures (or overpressures). The fluids of all rocks within the cell are maintained at a nearly constant overpressure (actual pressure minus hydrostatic pressure). Pressure cells which crop out at, or come close to, the surface tend to have very low overpressures, because any excess pressures are dissipated by flow of fluids through the cell to the surface. Deeper pressure cells without a high permeability connection either to the surface or to the shallowest 2 km of sediments tend to be overpressured. The shallower parts of these overpressured cells have higher overpressures than the overlying low permeability rocks. This situation can prevent an accumulation of oil or gas forming. The deeper parts of the same cells have lower overpressures than the overlying permeability rocks, and hence are more likely to contain accumulations of oil and gas.},

Regional-scale analyses of coupled groundwater flow and heat transport in the upper crust typically infer permeabilities in the range of 10 -17 to 10 -14 m 2, so that heat advection is sometimes significant and solute advection should nearly always be significant. Analyses of metamorphic systems suggest that a geochemically significant level of permeability can exist to the base of the crust. In active metamorphic systems in the mid to lower crust, where vertical hydraulic gradients are likely \textgreater10 MPa km -1, the mean permeabilities required to accommodate the estimated metamorphic fluid fluxes decrease from 10 -16 m 2 to 10 -18 m 2 between 5- and 12-km depth. Below 12 km, which broadly corresponds to the brittle-plastic transition, mean k is effectively independent of depth at 10 -18.51 m 2. Consideration of the permeability values inferred from thermal modeling and metamorphic fluxes suggests a quasi-exponential decay of permeability with depth of log k -3.2 log z - 14, where k is in meters squared and z is in kilometers. At mid to lower crustal depths this curve lies just below the threshold value for significant advection of heat. Such conditions may represent an optimum for metamorphism, allowing the maximum transport of fluid and solute mass that is possible without advective cooling.},

abstract = {We propose that zones of transient high permeability around ancient fault systems can be predicted if fault segments and likely locations for paleo-rupture arrest are identified. Lode gold deposits in the Kalgoorlie terrane, Western Australia, are the products of focused fluid flow through faulted crust. Deposits in the Mount Pleasant area are clustered on small-displacement structures over ∼10 km of the >50-km-long Black Flag fault. Field relationships and net slip distribution along the fault indicate that the deposits are adjacent to, but not within, a kilometer-scale dilatant jog, where two segments of the fault are linked. On this basis we infer that the dilatant jog was a long-term rupture-arrest site. The observations are compatible with rupture on segments of the Black Flag fault changing stress in the surrounding crust and bringing specific zones closer to failure. By analogy with active seismogenic fault systems, those zones correspond to regions where aftershocks occur preferentially after failure. Stress-transfer modeling of the system helps explain the location of mineralized small- displacement structures around the Black Flag fault and indicates that gold deposits in the area are located on structures that became transiently permeable and localized fluid flow during repeated aftershock ruptures. Thus, localized through-flow, or mixing of fluids within fault systems, is likely to be controlled by the distribution of aftershocks following rupture events; this distribution is predictable.},

abstract = {Abstract   Carbonate-hosted lead–zinc ore deposits in the Mississippi Valley region of North America and in the central midlands region
of Ireland provide good examples where ancient groundwater migration controlled ore formation deep within sedimentary basins.
Hydrogeologic and geochemical theories for ore genesis are explored in this paper with mathematical models that allow for
complex permeability fields in two or three dimensions, hydrothermal flows in fault systems, and coupled effects of geochemical
reactions. The hydrogeologic framework of carbonate-hosted ores is analyzed with the aim of developing a quantitative understanding
of the necessary and sufficient processes required to form large ore deposits. Numerical simulations of basin-scale hydrodynamics
and of deposit-scale reactive flow are presented to demonstrate the processes controlling low-temperature Pb–Zn ore genesis
in two world-class ore districts, in southeast Missouri, USA, and central Ireland.

The numerical models presented here provide a theoretical basis for the following observations: (1) topography-driven brine
migration was the most effective mechanism for forming the large ore districts of the Mississippi Valley, such as the Viburnum
Trend of southeast Missouri, during the uplift of the Appalachian–Ouachita mountain belt in late Paleozoic time; (2) three-dimensional
flow fields were created by a dolomite facies of the Viburnum Trend, which acted as a giant lens for focusing metal and heat
in southeast Missouri to produce the largest known concentration of lead in the Earth's crust; (3) ore-mineralization patterns
were controlled locally by basement relief, permeability structure, and sandstone pinchouts, because of their effects on cooling
and fluid-flow rates along the Viburnum Trend; (4) both density-driven and topography-driven fluid flow were important for
ore genesis in the Irish midlands, where brines moved northward away from the Variscan orogen, leaked into the Hercynian basement,
and discharged along normal faults up into the sedimentary cover; and (5) mixed convection within northeast–southwest fault
planes elevated heat flow and flow rates that fed ore deposition by fluid mixing, in some cases near the Carboniferous seafloor
in Ireland.},

abstract = {Groundwater is the world's largest accessible source of fresh water. It plays a vital role in satisfying basic needs for drinking water, agriculture and industrial activities. During times of drought groundwater sustains baseflow to rivers and wetlands, thereby supporting ecosystems. Most global-scale hydrological models (GHMs) do not include a groundwater flow component, mainly due to lack of geohydrological data at the global scale. For the simulation of lateral flow and groundwater head dynamics, a realistic physical representation of the groundwater system is needed, especially for GHMs that run at finer resolutions. In this study we present a global-scale groundwater model (run at 6' resolution) using MODFLOW to construct an equilibrium water table at its natural state as the result of long-term climatic forcing. The used aquifer schematization and properties are based on available global data sets of lithology and transmissivities combined with the estimated thickness of an upper, unconfined aquifer. This model is forced with outputs from the land-surface PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) model, specifically net recharge and surface water levels. A sensitivity analysis, in which the model was run with various parameter settings, showed that variation in saturated conductivity has the largest impact on the groundwater levels simulated. Validation with observed groundwater heads showed that groundwater heads are reasonably well simulated for many regions of the world, especially for sediment basins (R2 = 0.95). The simulated regional-scale groundwater patterns and flow paths demonstrate the relevance of lateral groundwater flow in GHMs. Inter-basin groundwater flows can be a significant part of a basin's water budget and help to sustain river baseflows, especially during droughts. Also, water availability of larger aquifer systems can be positively affected by additional recharge from inter-basin groundwater flows.},

The compressional mode of deformation in these sedimentary basins, originally formed by extension in an intraplate setting, is characterized by a spectrum of spatial wavelengths spanning several tens of kilometres up to several hundreds of kilometres. The actual mode of compressional deformation appears to be strongly affected by the rheological structure of the underlying lithosphere, the level of the regional intraplate stress field, and the geometry of the rifted basin configuration prior to late-stage compressional reactivation. The interplay of plumes and intraplate compressional deformation can lead to temporal transitions from basin inversion to lithospheric folding. These modes of deformation lead to substantial differential vertical motions, late-stage anomalies in subsidence and uplift patterns. The development of innovative combinations of numerical and analogue modelling techniques is the key to differentiating different modes of compressional deformation of passive margins and extensional basins.},

abstract = {The inversion of crustal-scale basement grabens is studied here through laboratory experiments on small-scale models and available oil industry seismic lines from the southern North Sea. Two basic configurations are considered. First, both the basement and the sedimentary cover are brittle, and inversion does not involve any potential d{\'{e}}collement between them. Second, the basement and sedimentary cover are separated by a weak ductile layer (e.g., salt), which can allow d{\'{e}}collement of the cover during both extension and later compression and inversion. The second configuration is more complicated and can lead to a large variety of geological structures. Laboratory experiments were carried out on brittle-ductile models built with sand to represent brittle layers (basement and sedimentary cover) and silicone putty to simulate the d{\'{e}}collement layer between basement and cover. A mechanically based classification of inversion structures is proposed. The effects of some crucial parameters are investigated, including obliquity between the direction of shortening and normal faults, as well as strength profiles, and the presence or absence of salt diapirs. The experimental investigation leads to the following conclusions: (1) the inversion of the graben by reactivation of normal faults implies that the angle between the direction of compression and the graben is less than 45°, (2) if there is a superficial d{\'{e}}collement (e.g., basement-cover interface), inversion initiates low dipping thrust faults in the cover, localized at graben borders, (3) salt diapirs or salt walls localized along the graben borders in the cover are preferential sites for the development of thrust faults, and (4) when the cover is decoupled from the basement by a d{\'{e}}collement layer, inversion induced deformation in the cover which is partitioned between thrust faults along the graben borders and strike-slip faults within the graben trending oblique to the graben borders. Experimental results are compared with field examples, in particular from the southern North Sea.},

abstract = {The age of groundwater, the time since the water recharged the subsurface, is a fundamental characteristic of groundwater that impacts diverse geologic processes and practical applications. The distribution of groundwater age depends on many factors including permeability, recharge rate, aquifer geometry, and topography. Seminal work simulated topography-driven regional groundwater flow with various topographies, localized high-permeability zones, and more recently with permeability decreasing with depth, but the role of layered aquifer systems which are common in both consolidated and unconsolidated sediments has not been systematically explored. Here we show that high age zones with predictable locations occur in layered geologic systems across a wide range of hydraulic gradients, basin geometries, and permeabilities. Numerical simulations of a generic three-layer aquifer system indicate that high age zones consistently form in the low-permeability layer near the middle of the basin. The zones of older groundwater result from low groundwater velocities in the low-permeability layer and the rejuvenation of the groundwater through mixing of different flow paths near discharge zones. The high age zones are not hydraulic stagnation points but are associated with areas of low velocity. Formation and location of zones of high groundwater ages in low-permeability units are important as these units are targeted for radioactive waste disposal and shale gas extraction. High age zones are also likely to affect geologic processes that depend on groundwater or solute fluxes and may serve as archives of past hydrological or climatological conditions.},

abstract = {Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites are the most compositionally primitive rocks in the solar system, but the most chemically pristine (CI1 and CM2 chondrites) have experienced pervasive aqueous alteration, apparently within asteroid parent bodies. Unfractionated soluble elements suggest very limited flow of liquid water, indicting a closed-system at scales large than 100's $\mu$m, consistent with data from oxygen isotopes, and meteorite petrography. However, numerical studies persistently predict large-scale (10's km) water transport in model asteroids, either in convecting cells, or via 'exhalation' flow - an open-system at scales up to 10's km. These models have tended to use permeabilites in the range 10- 13 to 10- 11 m2. We show that the permeability of plausible chondritic starting materials lies in the range 10- 19 to 10- 17 m2 (0.1-10 $\mu$D): around six orders-of-magnitude lower than previously assumed. This low permeability is largely a result of the extreme fine grain-size of primitive chondritic materials. Applying these permeability estimates in numerical models, we predict very limited liquid water flow (distances of 100's $\mu$m at most), even in a high porosity, water-saturated asteroid, with a high thermal gradient, over millions of years. Isochemical alteration, with flow over minimal lengthscales, is not a special circumstance. It is inevitable, once we consider the fundamental material properties of these rocks. To achieve large-scale flow it would require average matrix grain sizes in primitive materials of 10's-100's $\mu$m - orders of magnitude larger than observed. Finally, in addition to reconciling numerical modelling with meteorite data, our work explains several other features of these enigmatic rocks, most particularly, why the most chemically primitive meteorites are also the most altered. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Differential stress exerts both static and dynamic effects on rock-mass permeability, modulating fluid flow in the Earth's crust. Static stress fields impose a permeability anisotropy from stress-controlled features such as faults, extension fractures, and stylolites which, depending on the tectonic regime, may enhance, or counteract existing anisotropic permeability in layered rock sequences. Textural evidence from hydrothermal veins suggests, however, that fluid flow in fault-related fracture systems generally occurs episodically and that dynamic stress cycling effects are widespread. In the vicinity of active faults that undergo intermittent rupturing, permeability and fluid flux may be tied to the earthquake cycle through a range of mechanisms, leading to complex interactions between stress cycling, the creation and destruction of permeability, and fluid flow. Mechanisms for fluid redistribution include: (1) various forms of dilatancy (localized to the fault zone or extending through the surrounding rock mass) related to changes in shear stress and/or mean stress that occur during the fault loading cycle; (2) localized post-seismic redistribution around rupture irregularities, especially dilational jogs and bends which act as suction pumps; and (3) post-seismic discharge of fluids from overpressured portions of the crust through fault-valve action when ruptures breach impermeable barriers. All of these processes may be involved in fluid redistribution around active faults, but they operate to varying extents at different crustal levels, and in different tectonic regimes.},

abstract = {Regional geohydrologic characterization of the flow field in the coastal stratified basalt aquifer of the Pearl Harbor area in southern Oahu, Hawaii, is provided by a synthesis of geochemical and isotopic information, collected in vertical profiles, and numerical simulation of the variable-density groundwater flow. The uppermost water layer, 75 m to 125 m thick, consists of water recharged from local rainfall and irrigation over the past few decades. Below this is the core of the freshwater lens, 100 m to 150 m thick, containing waters with an apparent carbon-14 age of 1800 years. The freshwater lens floats on a third saltwater layer that likely extends to the bottom of the aquifer. The apparent carbon-14 age of the saltwater is between 6000 years and 9000 years, and the difference in ages between an inland well and a coastal well suggests that before aquifer development began in the 1880s, saltwater flowed inland at a velocity of about 2 m/yr. Assuming a constant lateral velocity in the saltwater body, the saltwater recharge area may thus be estimated to be 11 km to 24 km from the observation wells, in an area located between 1 km and 14 km offshore of the southern Oahu coast. Post-bomb carbon-14 and tritium data indicate a residence time of water within the freshwater lens of no more than a few tens of years. If total recharge estimates assumed here are correct, the 1800-year apparent age of this water can only be explained by long residence time in recharge area compartments the central plateau of Oahu and the dike zone in the Koolau Mountains before entering the lens, although the storage volume is not sufficient to account for the entire delay. In addition, some of the great apparent freshwater age may be accounted for by a component of old organic carbon introduced in the ground-water recharge area. The simple geochemical reactions in this aquifer system allow clear interpretation of water chemistry and isotopic data. The chemical and stable isotope composition of all samples is wellexplained by simple mixing of the three types of water. The major reaction in the saltwater is sodiumcalcium exchange, which increases calcium concentration over that of seawater, but which has negligible effect on carbon-14 dating. There is no evidence of calcite dissolution affecting the freshwater. Extrapolated aquifer saltwater carbon-13 content is somewhat lighter than oceanic values, probably indicative of oxidation of organic carbon. Assuming this organic carbon was devoid of carbon-14, measured carbon-14 values for saltwater must be adjusted upward by at most a factor of 1.24. Thus, carbon-14 values with or without adjustment give similar absolute ages and travel times of water flow between measurement points. Unfortunately, a number of samples collected show a high degree of scatter suggesting the possibility of contamination by modern carbon-14 during handling or analysis, reducing the quantity of vertical age data available from profiling. The characterization of both the freshwater and saltwater flow field obtained from geochemical analysis is consistent with regional hydrologie behavior of the Pearl Harbor area represented by the cross-sectional variable-density flow and solute transport model of Voss and Souza (1993). This model was based only on analysis of hydraulic data and vertical salinity profiles through the freshwater lens and saltwater transition zone. Thus, the simply-structured numerical model, which included an estimate of regional effective porosity for flow (0.04) that could not be verified on the basis of data existing at that time, can explain all currently-available geochemical and hydraulic field information. This may be the first analysis in which it was possible to corroborate ground-water model-calculated density-driven saltwater velocities in a coastal aquifer with flow velocity determined from chemical and isotopic field data.},

abstract = {The lithosphere thickness in the Variscan belt of central Europe varies between about 60 and 150 km with typical values of 100-120 km. Our estimates, derived from directionally independent representative P-wave residuals, are in good agreement with magnetotelluric determinations of a layer with increased conductivity in the upper mantle. The large-scale anisotropies of the subcrustal lithosphere beneath four seismological stations determined from spatial variations of relative P residuals vary between 6.5 and 15.2% for P velocities; the S-wave anisotropies determined from SKS polarizations vary between 2.2 and 6.7%. These values are in reasonable agreement with the anisotropies of peridotites determined in laboratory. Systematic spatial variations of the directional terms of relative residuals in dependence on azimuths and incidence angles suggest the existence of large dipping anisotropic structures in the subcrustal lithosphere. The residual patterns at most stations in the Saxothuringicum, Rhenohercynicum and in the Massif Central imply northwesterly orientated dips of the anisotropic structures while stations in the Moldanubicum, the Alpine Foredeep and most of the Alps north of the Insubric line, suggest southeasterly orientated dips. In our interpretation the dipping anisotropic structures may represent paleosubductions which retain olivine preferred orientations originating from an ancient oceanic lithosphere. The Variscides of central Europe may thus represent a collision zone characterized by two systems of paleosubductions divergent relative to the suture between the Moldanubicum and the Saxothuringicum.},

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important pathway of trace element and nutrient cycling in the coastal ocean. Since terrestrial and marine SGD driving forces are usually superimposed, it is difficult to separate their relative contributions. This work uses continuous, long-term (∼2 years) records of seawater 222Rn to estimate total SGD rates and hydrological observations to examine the driving forces of SGD at a coastal site on the Gulf of Mexico. While seasonal cycles cannot be clearly identified, short-term fluctuations were ubiquitous. Radon-derived SGD was strongly associated with the neap spring tidal cycle, at least during a period of extreme drought when minimum external disturbances were present. We applied multiple independent approaches to separate the relative contribution of fresh and saline SGD. A salinity mixing model indicated that the contribution of fresh SGD ranged between 3 and 12%. The rate of freshening of water within a seepage meter required vertical freshwater advection of ∼0.9 cm d−1 at low tide, which is <10% of the total SGD estimated from 222Rn (∼11 cm d−1). Darcy's law calculations and water table decline rate also suggested a fresh SGD contribution <5%. The temporal trends in total SGD and the reasonable agreement of our multiple approaches indicate that transient marine forces, likely tidal pumping, dominate benthic advective exchange in these permeable sediments. Compared to regional river inputs, our conservatively extrapolated saline SGD is on the same order of magnitude, but fresh groundwater only represents a small fraction. Future investigations should refine techniques for scaling up local observations.},

The balance between advance of the weathering front by mechanical and chemical processes and mass loss by denudation fixes the thickness of the Critical Zone reactor. The internal structure of this reactor is controlled by physical processes that create surface area, determine flow paths, and set the residence time of material in the Critical Zone.

abstract = {The geological and geophysical phenomena associated with water in the slab can be grouped into three different categories: those related to 1) the storage of water in the oceanic lithosphere at the surface, 2) the subduction of a hydrated slab and 3) its dehydration that ultimately leads to mantle regassing. Widespread hydration of the uppermost oceanic lithosphere occurs at mid-ocean ridges and more pervasively at the trench-rise system in response to bending-related fracturing and faulting. The amount of water stored in the upper lithosphere appears to be proportional to the spreading slowness and amount of bending. Hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic plate may also occur more locally along transform margins, fracture zones and volcanic ridges. Subduction of a hydrated slab should be observed from a reduction of seismic velocities, anomalous Vp/Vs ratios and seismic anisotropy in its uppermost portions, and shift of the main phase transformation boundaries characteristic of the mantle. Because of the increased buoyancy and weakness, hydrated or wet slabs should tend to stagnate over the 660. km discontinuity, favoring layered mantle convection patterns. Slab dehydration takes place according to the plate thermal regime function of the slab age and sinking velocity. Hydrous minerals in the oceanic crust and mantle are stable down to a maximum of 300. km and 1200. km depth, respectively, after which minor amounts of water can be retained in nominally anhydrous minerals. There is abundant geophysical evidence for dehydration of the slab crust and sub-Moho mantle, while fragmentary and often indirect evidence supports the presence of water in the lower plane of the Double Seismic Zone and at depths >. 300. km. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Taranaki Basin is an active-margin basin that has been significantly affected by Miocene subduction tectonics along the Pacific-Australian plate boundary. We have analyzed its present-day thermal state using 354 bottom-hole temperatures (BHTs) from 115 wells distributed throughout the basin. The measured temperatures were corrected using an exact solution to Bullard's equation rather than the Horner approximation, thereby allowing for recovery dependence on well diameter and correction for some BHTs at early time after circulation had ceased. Thermal conductivity measurements were completed on 256 samples from eight wells, and matrix conductivities were determined for six end-member lithologies by inversion. Formation conductivities are based on the conductivity and relative proportion of each end-member component. Corrected BHTs, in situ thermal conductivity, and estimates of sediment heat production were combined to compute the present-day, steady state heat flow. The average heat flow is 60 mW m-2, but important geographic variations are present: heat flow on the Western Platform is remarkably consistent at 53-60 mW m-2, attesting to its relative stability since the Late Cretaceous; heat flow in the southern part of the basin is 65N70 mW m-2 due to as much as 3 km of late Miocene erosion; on the southern onshore and to the south of the peninsula, heat flow is 50+/-3 mW m-2, possibly due to the heat sink effects of crustal thickening; heat flow is highest at 74 mW m-2 on the northern peninsula adjacent to the Taranaki volcanic zone; suggesting a causal relationship between Quaternary volcanism and high heat flow.},

abstract = {Abstract  The Harz Mountains and the adjacent Subhercynian Cretaceous Basin figure as the most prominent surface representative for Late Cretaceous inversion structures in Central Europe. Facies, depositional architecture and provenance of the basin fill reflect mechanisms and timing of the exhumation of the Harz. From Hauterivian to Early Santonian there is no evidence for detrital input from the nearby Harz area. Sediments are mature quartzarenites derived from Paleozoic basement rocks and/or recycled Permian to Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. This situation changed drastically in Middle to Late Santonian when freshly exhumed and eroded Mesozoic sedimentary cover rocks of the Harz were delivered into the basin. Feldspar and lithoclasts reflect erosion of Triassic and, in places, Jurassic to Turonian strata. Apatite and garnet in heavy mineral spectra are derived from largely unweathered Lower Triassic Buntsandstein as indicated by apatite and garnet chemistry. In Early Campanian, Paleozoic lithoclasts indicate erosion cutting down into the basement of the Harz. Simultaneous strong decrease of feldspar, garnet and apatite suggest an almost complete removal of the 2–3 km thick Mesozoic cover of the Harz within only 2–4 Myr. This translates into an exhumation rate of approximately 1 mm/a consistent with apatite fission track data from granitoid rocks of the Harz Mountains.},

abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

abstract = {The subsidence history of Australia's southern margin is shown to consist of two distinct tectonic phases and has important implications for models of sedimentary basin formation. The first phase is characterized by rapid tectonic subsidence (about 50 m/m.y.) which lasted for about 25-30 m.y. during the Early Cretaceous. The period of rapid subsidence represents the rifting phase of margin development. This early stage is correlated with associated rifting phenomena: faulting and extension of the brittle upper crust, formation of grabens and half-grabens, and the rapid accumulation of volcanogenic detritus (Otway Group). The amount of extension (20-50%) is estimated from a comparison of observed and modeled tectonic subsidence at several exploratory wells along the margin The model includes uniform extension and thinning of the continental lithosphere, a prolonged extensional event followed by simple cooling, horizontal and vertical conduction of heat, and radioactive heat production by the crust. The rift phase may have begun earlier, but the most rapid and widespread subsidence occurred during the Early Cretaceous. The end of rapid and widespread subsidence occurred during the Early Cretaceous. The end of rapid subsidence coincides closely with the age of the oldest sea floor spreading magnetic anomaly (about 90 Ma) adjacent to the continent-ocean boundary (COB). The second stage of margin development is the post-rift (or drift) phase, a period of much slower rates of subsidence and relative tectonic quiescence. Subsidence during the post-rift stage is modeled as cooling and contraction of extended continental lithosphere. Estimates of extension and thinning from subsidence modeling agree with seismic refraction measurements of the thickness of continental crust near the COB. Estimates of extension from the geometry of basement blocks near the COB do not agree with the analysis from subsidence modeling. Upper crustal extension seems to record only a small proportion of total lithospheric extension. Alternative or supplementary mechanisms of extension are explored, with emphasis on implications from a model that includes localized shear along a lithospheric detachment system.},

abstract = {There is little doubt that sediments of Upper Jurassic to lowermost Lower Cretaceous age, particularly those of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation and its equivalents, are the source of the vast bulk of the oil in the Central and Northern North Sea. This is true both of oil in conventional Mesozoic plays and in Tertiary clastic reservoirs. The timing of oil generation and migration ranges from the Late Cretaceous through to the present. The oil productivity of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation in the Central Graben, Moray Firth and South Viking, Graben areas of the North Sea is estimated to be in excess of 250 billion barrels, of which about 25% is accounted for in accumulations discovered to date. There is strong areal differentiation between oil trapped in Mesozoic reservoirs as opposed to Upper Cretaceous Chalk and Tertiary reservoirs. This paper is particularly concerned with hydrocarbons in Tertiary reservoirs, which have a wide range of compositions and appear to have complex accumulation and degradation histories. Migration to Chalk and younger Tertiary reservoirs occurs often through thick shale sequences. The evidence for the timing and mechanism of this process is considered and a preferred model for the vertical migration and subsequent lateral migration, mixing and degradation is proposed.},

abstract = {The European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) transects Variscan basement, Permo-Carboniferous troughs and Late Permian to Mesozoic series, deposited in thermal sag basins, which are exposed on rift-related arches. We have analysed processes governing the transformation of the orogenically destabilized Variscan lithosphere into end-Cretaceous stabilized cratonic lithosphere, prior to its renewed Cenozoic rift-related destabilization. In the ECRIS area, crustal and lithospheric thicknesses at present are in the range of 24-35 km and 60-120 km, respectively. The Variscan orogen was characterized at the time of its end-Westphalian consolidation by 45-60 km deep crustal roots, marking major sutures. During the Stephanian-Early Permian wrench-induced collapse of the Variscan orogen, subducted lithospheric slabs were detached, causing upwelling of the asthenosphere, thermal thinning and/or partial delamina-tion of the lithospheric mantle, and regional uplift. By mid-Permian times, the crust was thinned to 28-35 km owing to its regional erosional unroofing, localized mechanical stretching and the interaction of mantle-derived melts with its basal parts. By mid-Permian times, when the temperature of the asthenosphere returned to ambient levels, thermal subsidence of the lithosphere commenced, controlling development of a system of Late Permian and Mesozoic intracratonic basins. These experienced repeated minor subsidence accelerations, related to the build-up of far-field stresses, which did not involve renewed lithospheric destabilization. Modelling of observed subsidence curves indicates that during the mid-Permian lithospheric thicknesses ranged in the ECRIS area between 40 and 80 km, but had increased by the end of the Cretaceous to 100-120 km. Cenozoic rifting and mantle-plume activity caused renewed lithospheric thinning.},

abstract = {Rifting activity is probably mainly governed by frictional forces exerted on the base of the lithosphere by the convecting sub-lithospheric upper mantle, combined with deviatoric tensional stresses developing over upwelling branches of the asthenospheric convection system, and by far-filed stresses controlling the interaction of lithospheric plates moving relative to each other. Mantle plumes rising from the deep mantle do not appear to be a major driving force of rifting. Therefore, it is questioned whether a distinction between "active" and "passive" rifts is still justified. Lithospheric extension triggers by decompression partial melting of the lower lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. Magmatic processes contribute materially to thinning of the subcrustal lithosphere and probably also of the lower crust. This could explain the frequently observed discrepancy between upper crustal extension by faulting and lower crustal attenuation as defined by refraction and deep reflection seismic data. The duration of the rifting stage of palaeorifts and passive margins is highly variable. Depending on plate interaction, crustal separation can be achieved after as little as 7 Ma and as much as 280 Ma of rifting activity. The availability of crustal discontinuities does not appear to play a significant role in the time required for crustal separation to be achieved. The structural style of rifts is controlled by the physical state of the lithosphere, the mode and amount of its extension and the lithological composition of pre- and syn-rift sediments. Subsidence of rift basins is controlled by the balance between isostatic adjustment of the crust to lithospheric stretching and uplift induced by mechanical and thermal attenuation of the subcrustal lithosphere. Post-rift basin subsidence is mainly governed by the decay of rift-induced thermal anomalies; densification of the lower crust and intra-plate stresses provide overprinting effects. In view of this it is unlikely that quantitative analyses of post-rift basin subsidence give a direct measure of lithospheric extension. Tectonically active rifts, palaeorifts and passive margin basins contain major hydrocarbon provinces. Their hydrocarbon charge can rely exclusively on pre-rift, syn-rift or post-rift sedimentary sequences or a combination thereof. Maturation of source-rocks can be achieved during the syn- and/or post-rift stage of basin evolution. During rifting, conductive and convective heat transfer accounts for elevated geothermal gradients; these play an important role in the maturation of pre and syn-rift source-rocks; thermal gradients decrease asymptotically during the post-rift stage.},

Three source rocks are considered in the modelling: Lower Jurassic oil-prone shales,Westphalian gas-prone coal deposits, and Lower Namurian oil-prone shales.The Lower Namurian hydrocarbon system of the basin is discussed for the first time. According to the modelling results of the Early Jurassic oil system, the oil accumulations were filled just after the main inversion event. Their predicted locations are in agreement with exploration results. Modelling results of the Westphalian gas system, however, show smaller and larger sized accumulations at unexplored locations. The gas reservoirs were filled during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting phase. Results of modelling of the Lower Namurian oil system indicate that gas formed by secondary cracking of the oils can have mixed with the Westphalian coal-derived gas. Such a mixing is inferred from geochemical analyses. The existence of a Lower Namurian hydrocarbon system in the West Netherlands Basin implies that hydrocarbons are possibly trapped in the Westphalian and Namurian successions. These potential traps in the basin have not yet been explored.},

abstract = {The evolution of an orogen is marked by phases of topographic growth, equilibrium, and decay. During these phases erosion rates vary in response to temporal and spatial changes in climate, topographic relief and slope, and deformation. Detrital thermochronometer cooling-age data collected from syntectonic basin deposits are a promising tool for quantifying erosion histories during orogenic evolution. Previous studies typically assume steady-state erosion for interpreting detrital data, although in many situations this assumption is not justified. Here we present a new numerical modeling approach that predicts thermochronometer cooling ages in a stratigraphic section where sediment is sourced from a region with a temporally variable erosion history. Multiple thermochronometer cooling ages are predicted at different stratigraphic horizons as a function of variable erosion histories, rock cooling rates in the hinterland, and thermophysical material properties and boundary conditions. The modeling approach provides the context for the interpretation of natural data, including geologically realistic situations with a temporally varying erosion rate. The results of three end-member hinterland erosion histories are explored: (1) steady-state erosion; (2) increasing erosion rate with time; and (3) decreasing erosion rate with time. Results indicate that for steady erosion rates between 0.2 and 1.0 mm/yr, up to 30 m.y. will pass following a change in erosion rate before the detrital ages have adjusted to reflect a new erosion regime. In simulations with transient erosion, the estimation of erosion rates from a detrital record using assumption of thermal steady-state will generally be in error, often by as much as - 25 to 100%. These results highlight that assumptions of steady erosion in mountain belts should be used with caution. Application of the model to thermochronometer cooling ages preserved in syntectonic sediments sourced from the Nanga Parbat region, Himalaya, illustrates how the transient catchment averaged erosion history can be quantified with detrital thermochronology. In this example, we found that erosion rates increased over the past 20 Ma, from about 1.0 mm/yr to modern rates in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 mm/yr.},

The most common—like kaolinite, illite, chlorite, and smectite—are found in various amounts in mudstones and are also often found in clastic and nonclastic reservoir rocks. Their presence alters the elastic behavior of reservoir rocks significantly as a function of mineral type, volume and distribution. Thus, two sandstones with the same clay amount might have different elastic properties due to differences within the clay population. The elastic properties of clay minerals are therefore important in rock physics modeling to understand the seismic and sonic log responses of shaley sequences and clay-bearing reservoir rocks.},

On the average, velocity decreases, increases and attenuation roughly with increasing total porosity. Velocity and attenuation values are related to the variation of grain contact structure, and two samples with the same porosity and permeability may exhibit different velocities and attenuations. The clear correlation between hydraulic properties and porosity is related to constant grain size, while the lack of correlation for acoustic properties emphasizes the importance of the microstructure.},

abstract = {While initial studies showed a high degree of consistency between AFTA and apatite (U-Th)/He dating, an increasing number of studies are reporting apatite (U-Th)/He ages which are older than expected on the basis of apatite fission track data from the same region. We present data from a range of geological settings to document a systematic discrepancy between the two systems, which becomes more pronounced in samples with older fission track ages (except for samples with very low uranium contents). Results from a granite pebble and enclosing volcanogenic sandstone provide a well-controlled test case in which independent constraints are available on the underlying thermal history. These demonstrate that the progressive discrepancy between the two techniques arises not from anomalous fission track annealing behaviour, as has been suggested, but as a result of a change in the He retention properties of apatite. This change appears to be linked to the degree of accumulated radiation damage within the crystal lattice, although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We suggest detailed experiments should be performed to delineate and quantify the processes responsible. Until this is achieved, we suggest that apatite (U-Th)/He studies should also incorporate apatite fission track data, as well as other low temperature indicators, in order to monitor the (U-Th)/He system response and to guard against the anomalous behaviour described here.},

abstract = {Pronounced changes in clay mineral assemblages are preserved along the Moab Fault (Utah). Gouge is enriched up to ∼40% in 1Mdillite relative to protolith, whereas altered protolith in the damage zone is enriched ∼40% in illite-smectite relative to gouge and up to ∼50% relative to protolith. These mineralogical changes indicate that clay gouge is formed not solely through mechanical incorporation of protolith, but also through fault-related authigenesis. The timing of mineralization is determined using40Ar/39Ar dating of size fractions of fault rocks with varying detrital and authigenic clay content. We applied Ar dating of illite-smectite samples, as well as a newer approach that uses illite polytypes. Our analysis yields overlapping, early Paleocene ages for neoformed (1Md) gouge illite (63±2 Ma) and illite-smectite in the damage zone (60±2 Ma), which are compatible with results elsewhere. These ages represent the latest period of major fault motion, and demonstrate that the fault fabrics are not the result of recent alteration. The clay fabrics in fault rocks are poorly developed, indicating that fluids were not confined to the fault zone by preferentially oriented clays; rather we propose that fluids in the illite-rich gouge were isolated by adjacent lower permeability, illite-smectite-bearing rocks in the damage zone. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A dramatic increase in sediment flux since ca. 5 Ma has been inferred for the European Alps and worldwide, and is interpreted to reflect a climatically driven increase in erosion rates. However, detrital thermochronology data from the Alpine forelands suggest steady Miocene-Pliocene exhumation, contradicting the sediment budget data. We present new detrital apatite fission-track (AFT) data from the foreland of the Western Alps to better resolve Miocene to present-day exhumation rates and to determine sediment provenance. A shift in AFT lag time from <3 m.y. before 13 Ma to [$\sim$]6 m.y. from 10 Ma on reflects reorganization of the drainage pattern within the Alps. AFT lag times are constant since then. Thermal modeling reveals that our detrital AFT data set is sufficiently sensitive to detect an increase in erosion rate, but our data record overall steady exhumation of the Western Alps since 10 Ma. Hence, increasing climatically controlled erosion may have been balanced by decreasing tectonic activity since ca. 5 Ma.},

While this system has only minor freshwater inputs of nutrients or radium, it is an extremely productive ecosystem. In addition, there are significant exports of these dissolved species to the coastal ocean. Saline groundwater in this estuarine system contains nutrient and radium concentrations more than an order of magnitude greater than surface waters. Using a radium mass balance, we estimate the groundwater discharge necessary to support the export of radium to the coastal ocean and the corresponding flux of nutrients from the groundwater. From these calculations, we show that the underlying aquifer supplies nutrients sufficient to support the net primary productivity of the salt marsh ecosystem and to account for the known export of nutrients from the marsh. We conclude that the major nutrient source to the North Inlet, South Carolina, salt marsh is the saline aquifer lying just beneath the surface of the marsh. Furthermore, extrapolation of the nutrient export to include other South Carolina marshes suggests that nutrient fluxes from salt marshes to the coastal ocean rival riverine nutrient fluxes for the region.},

Terrains were locally bounded by thrust packages, by NW-SE trending strike-slip -- transform faults parallel to the accretion direction, and by NE-SW trending strike-slip faults defining localized oblique collision or, more generally, boundaries to zones of lateral continental extrusion and escape. Close analogies can be made with the Tertiary Makran-Himalaya-Tibet collisional zones.

abstract = {SUMMARY Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) observations are generally influenced by drilling-induced thermal disturbances which must be corrected for. This paper presents a correction method based on a 1-D conductive finite element model and an inverse procedure for parameter estimation. While the technique may be applied to any section of the borehole this paper focuses on the correction of bottom hole temperatures. Model parameters are mud temperature during drilling and circulation at the depth of BHT observations, borehole radius, thermal parameters of mud and formation, and the equilibrium formation temperature. Data are one or more successive BHTs and their standard deviations. Prior to inversion the model parameters are assigned reasonable values and standard deviations that reflect the confidence in those values. A high level of confidence implies small standard deviations and vice versa. The process of inversion extracts the most likely values of all free parameters including the equilibrium formation temperature. Furthermore, the initial uncertainties in all parameters and data are propagated into uncertainties in the final parameter estimates. The formation temperature estimate is an unbiased estimate of the true formation temperature when the a priori parameter estimates and their standard deviations are consistent with the actual physical conditions in the borehole and the formation. The method on average yields 5-10 per cent higher equilibrium temperature estimates than does the Horner plot method and displays a strong consistency with temperature obtained during production tests. This is of importance to the understanding of terrestrial heat flow density patterns, and thermal structure of sedimentary basins, and to the modelling of hydrocarbon generation. The theory and results from the processing of 41 BHT series from 27 industrial wells in the North Sea Central Graben are presented.},

abstract = { A review of basin studies for which both apatite fission track and vitrinite reflectance data are available suggests that total annealing of fission tracks in detrital apatite grains generally occurs at Romax values in the range 0.7 to 0.9% for effective heating times between 106 and 108 years. This observation is in general agreement with predictions based on the comparison of kinetic models for annealing of fission tracks in apatite and the evolution of vitrinite reflectance. The integration of apatite fission track thermochronology and vitrinite reflectance is therefore not only favored by the complementary nature of the two techniques, it is also enhanced by the ability to predict a response in one system with data from the other. },

abstract = {The two German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB) boreholes provided samples for studies of fluid inclusions (paleofluids), “free fluids” of the crystalline basement, and their fingerprints on the chemical and isotopic composition of minerals and rocks to 9101 m depth, which allowed reconstruction of the evolution of fluids, their migration pathways, and their sources. Aqueous fluids were largely lost during the Devonian amphibolite facies metamorphism. Thereafter, radiogenic, nucleogenic, and fissiogenic gases, together with NH4-fixed nitrogen, were released from host rocks and partly enclosed in secondary inclusions. During the Hercynian uplift, Na-Cl fluids (formation water) infiltrated and dissolved noble gases and N2 largely originating from the host rocks. In the course of the Cretaceous denudation, high-salinity Ca-Na-Cl brines, possibly derived from Permo-Carboniferous sediments but altered by fluid/rock interaction, migrated into their present position. This fluid introduced low-maturity hydrocarbons released together with nitrogen from early metamorphic organic-rich sediments. The 4000-m fluid from the KTB pilot hole pumping test, which was analyzed chemically and isotopically, seems to be a mixture of an ascending basement brine and a descending paleometeoric water, from which the late alteration minerals calcite and laumontite precipitated in fractures. The calcite is neither chemically nor isotopically in equilibrium with the recovered “free fluid.” Hydraulic tests indicate a communicating system of fractures between the boreholes with a distinct matrix and fracture porosity.},

abstract = {Cold, dense subducting lithosphere provides the primary force driving tectonic plates at Earth's surface. The force available to drive the plates depends on a balance between the buoyancy forces driving subduction and the mechanical and buoyancy forces resisting subduction. Because both the buoyancy and rheology of the slab and mantle depend on temperature, composition, grain size, water content, and melt fraction, unraveling which of these processes exert a first-order control on slab dynamics and under what circumstances other processes become first-order effects can be challenging. Laboratory and numerical models of slab dynamics provide a powerful method for testing the combined effects of buoyancy and strength changes that accompany the slab evolution in the upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle. Recent studies have focused on understanding how rheologic variations (Newtonian versus non-Newtonian viscosity or water content), geometry (2D versus 3D), and plate motions (trench roll-back or ad...},

abstract = {A reconnaissance apatite fission track study was undertaken in eastern Ireland to evaluate the low temperature thermal history of Palaeozoic basement rocks outcropping adjacent to the Irish Sea basin. On a sampling transect across the lapetus suture zone the distributions of single grain ages and track lengths indicate cooling after maximum palaeotemperatures of between 80 and 100-110[deg]C at various times during the Early Tertiary (about 30-45 Ma). Although a significant component of Tertiary uplift and erosion is inferred in eastern Ireland from geological observations, maximum palaeotemperatures are interpreted as principally due to heat advection by gravity-driven groundwater flow following Early Tertiary uplift at about 60 Ma. This phase of fluid flow produced the localized remagnetization of the Palaeozoic basement and overlying Carboniferous limestones in north Co. Dublin. Limited sampling in eastern Ireland indicates extreme local heterogeneity in apatite age, also characteristic of apatite fission track results from northern England. Thus heterogeneity requires an annealing control, independent of the sample's thermal history, suggested to be the individual crystal uranium content and indirectly the effects of fluid flow.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity can be dealt with by defining homogeneous equivalent properties, known as averaging, or by trying to describe the spatial variability of the rock properties from geologic observations and local measurements. The techniques available for these descriptions are mostly continuous Geostatistical models, or discontinuous facies models such as the Boolean, Indicator or Gaussian-Threshold models and the Markov chain model. These facies models are better suited to treating issues of rock strata connectivity, e.g. buried high permeability channels or low permeability barriers, which greatly affect flow and, above all, transport in aquifers. Genetic models provide new ways to incorporate more geology into the facies description, an approach that has been well developed in the oil industry, but not enough in hydrogeology. The conclusion is that future work should be focused on improving the facies models, comparing them, and designing new in situ testing procedures (including geophysics) that would help identify the facies geometry and properties. A world-wide catalog of aquifer facies geometry and properties, which could combine site genesis and description with methods used to assess the system, would be of great value for practical applications.},

The Valley and Ridge Province Tioga and Kalkberg ash bed samples yield apatite fission-track apparent ages and track length distributions that indicate early post-Alleghanian (285-270 Ma) cooling and unroofing that began at ∼250 Ma. Assuming a geothermal gradient of 25°C km−1, a burial depth of at least 3.4 km can be estimated for all the Pennsylvania samples.  At the Allegheny structural front and on the western Allegheny Plateau, the apatite fission-track apparent ages (<150 Ma) and track length measurements indicate a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous thermal event for these samples possibly resulting from a higher geothermal gradient coinciding with kimberlite intrusion at this time along the Greene-Potter Fault Zone. },

abstract = {An unconformity is present close to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary in the onshore and nearshore portions of the Otway, Port Phillip-Torquay, and Gippsland basins of southeast Australia. The unconformity is angular (generally \textless 1-5degrees angularity), with the underlying Miocene units having been deformed (gentle folding and reverse faulting) and eroded prior to deposition of the Pliocene succession. The unconformity also marks a change from Oligocene-Miocene deposition of cool-water carbonate sediments and brown coal-bearing successions to the accumulation of more siliciclastic-rich sediments in Pliocene time. The Miocene-Pliocene boundary therefore represents an interval of significant regional uplift in the southeast Australian basins. The amount of section removed is greatest around the Otway and Strzelecki ranges in Victoria, where up to a kilometer of section may have been removed. In most onshore sections of the Victorian basins hundreds of meters of section have been eroded. In distal offshore locations the boundary becomes conformable. The timing of uplift and erosion is best constrained in the Otway and Port Phillip basins, where late Miocene (N16 [\textasciitilde] 10 Ma) sediments underlie the unconformity and earliest Pliocene ([\textasciitilde] 5 Ma) sediments overlie it. This timing coincides with a change in the dynamics of the Australian plate, beginning at around 12 Ma. Southeast Australia is currently under a NW-SE compressional regime, and this has probably persisted since the late Miocene. In the basins (as opposed to the basement-dominated highland areas), the late Miocene uplift event is more significant than later Pliocene-Recent uplift.},

The intrusion model was updated and adjusted to incorporate recent data and we also modelled pre-Zechstein structures using different scenarios.

Other experimental factors may introduce additional non-Poissonian errors, which must be taken into account. In the population method, sampling of non-homogeneous uranium distributions introduces experimental error. In the external detector method (EDM), many factors exist to introduce such error. Simply quoting total numbers of spontaneous and induced fission tracks obtained by the EDM may disguise the possible influence of experimental variation. The present work concentrates on the EDM, and describes a test which has recently been proposed to detect the presence of experimental error in EDM analyses. The question of an alternative analysis for cases where such error is present is also considered. A method of presenting EDM data is suggeted, which allows assessment of the importance of experimental errors.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional finite-difference thermal modelling of the major extensional Simplon Fault Zone in the Central Alps establishes that the shape of cooling curves for samples from the footwall and hanging wall at various distances from the detachment are very sensitive to the actual displacement history. If the displacement had occurred within a very limited time span (18-15 Ma), samples from the hanging wall close to the detachment should have significantly increased in temperature, with a peak around 14 Ma. This is not discernible in the cooling curves interpreted from the mineral ages. If the rate of normal fault displacement had been lower but constant from 18 Ma to present, the cooling curves for the footwall should show a correspondingly steady decrease in temperature. The interpreted cooling curves from mineral ages are steep after 18 Ma, becoming shallower in more recent times. This shape can be reproduced by the thermal modelling for a variable rate of fault displacement, initially rapid (total relative displacement 10 mm/a across the fault zone) between 18 and 15 Ma but reducing to a more steady 0.4 mm/a between 15 Ma and 3 Ma. The corresponding exhumation rate of the footwall was 4.6 mm/a from 18 to 15 Ma, and 0.6 mm/a from 15 to 3 Ma, whereas the hanging wall was exhumed at a constant rate of 0.4 mm/a. The difference in cooling curves for samples with increasing horizontal distance into the footwall reflects a distributed ductile shear, with the sample at 20 km distance initially at 25 km depth at 25 Ma, whereas that at 70 m distance was only at 19 km depth. At the same time samples in the hanging wall were at 10 km depth. Total relative displacement parallel to the fault plane was around 36 km. The thermal modelling demonstrates that during rapid fault displacement the "apparent" exhumation rate calculated assuming a constant geothermal gradient is too low, whereas the "apparent" rate calculated for the subsequent period of slower displacement is too high.},

Indeed, water flow and solute transport may be associated with several types of driving forces, or gradients (chemical, electrical, thermal), in addition to the hydraulic forces, resulting in the so-called coupled flows. Fluid flow caused by driving forces different than hydraulic gradients is referred to as osmosis. Chemical osmosis, the water flow induced by a chemical gradient across a semi-permeable membrane, can generate pressure increase. The question thus arises if there is a risk to create high pore pressures that could damage the near-field of medium-level waste (MLW) galleries, if osmotically driven water flows towards the galleries are produced by the release of large amounts of NaNO3 (750 t) in the formation. To what extent a low-permeability clay formation such as the Boom Clay acts as an osmotic membrane is thus a key issue to assess the relevance of osmosis phenomena for the disposal of medium-level waste. An in situ osmosis experiment has been conducted at the Hades underground research laboratory to determine the osmotic efficiency of Boom Clay at the field scale. A recently developed chemical osmosis flow continuum model has been used to design the osmosis experiment, and to interpret the water pressure measurements. Experimental data could be reproduced quite accurately by the model, and the inferred parameter values are consistent with independent determinations for Boom Clay. A rapid water pressure increase (but limited to about a 2 m water column) was observed after 12 h in the filter containing the more saline water. Then, the osmotically induced water pressure slowly decays on several months. So, the experimental results obtained in situ confirm the occurrence of non-hydraulic flow phenomena (chemical osmosis) in a low-permeability plastic formation such as the Boom Clay. The osmotic efficiency of Boom Clay is high under undisturbed chemical conditions ([sigma] = 0.41 at 0.014 M NaHCO3), but rapidly decreases when the dissolved salts concentration increases ([sigma] = 0.07 at 0.14 M NaHCO3). A semi-permeable membrane behaviour of the Boom Clay (high efficiencies) may be expected for the disposal of nitrate-bearing radioactive waste. However, the presently observed osmotically induced pressure is too low to have a significant mechanical impact on the host rock. Finally, the short duration of the osmosis test performed suggests that the shut-in test method used is effective for osmosis testing.},

abstract = {[`]Inversion structures' (e.g. folds, reverse faults) spatially associated with basin-bounding faults are very widely recognised in rift basins in both onshore and offshore settings worldwide. The great majority of such structures are attributed to local or regional crustal shortening events. There is, however, an alternative, which is investigated in this paper: inversion could reflect a horizontal shortening component of deformation formed during progressive and partitioned transtension. A case study from the Carboniferous Northumberland Basin shows that shortening structures can also form in obliquely divergent rifts if the bulk strain undergoes kinematic partitioning into distinct regions of wrench- and extension-dominated transtension. Such strain partitioning appears to be particularly favoured in basins where fault localisation is strongly influenced by pre-existing basement structures. This may occur because the pre-existing anisotropies are zones of long-lived weakness that lie in an orientation particularly favourable to the preferential accommodation of either strike-slip or dip-slip displacements. Our strain analysis applied to the Northumberland Basin, traditionally considered as a classic example of a Variscan inverted basin, reduces the deformation history to a single kinematically partitioned phase of dextral transtension during the late Carboniferous-early Permian. Our findings have profound implications for the interpretation of inversion structures in any rift basin where the direction of extension may be significantly oblique to the basin margins.},

abstract = {AFTSolve is a computer program for deriving thermal history information from apatite fission-track data. It implements a new fission-track annealing model that takes into account the known kinetic variability among different apatite species. To fully utilize this model, a fission-track worker must obtain data that can be used to infer the kinetic characteristics of each apatite grain from which a measurement was taken. Such data can consist of etch figure lengths or chemical composition. The benefit of this overall approach is that it allows useful information to be derived from previously unusable analyses, extends the practical range of geological temperatures constrained by fission-track analyses, and increases overall confidence in model predictions. AFTSolve also incorporates the effects of fission-track orientation relative to the apatite crystallographic c-axis, variation in initial track length, and the biasing effect of 252Cf irradiation for enhancing confined horizontal track length detection. AFTSolve is written for Windows operating systems, and has a graphical interface that allows interactive input of thermal histories and real-time generation of estimates for fission-track length distributions and ages for up to six simultaneously modeled kinetic populations. It also includes procedures for estimating the range of time-temperature histories that are statistically consistent with a data set and constraints entered by the user.},

abstract = {An earthquake occurs when a fault weakens during the early portion of its slip at a faster rate than the release of tectonic stress driving the fault motion. This slip weakening occurs over a critical distance, D(c). Understanding the controls on D(c) in nature is severely limited, however, because the physical mechanism of weakening is unconstrained. Conventional friction experiments, typically conducted at slow slip rates and small displacements, have obtained D(c) values that are orders of magnitude lower than values estimated from modelling seismological data for natural earthquakes. Here we present data on fluid transport properties of slip zone rocks and on the slip zone width in the centre of the Median Tectonic Line fault zone, Japan. We show that the discrepancy between laboratory and seismological results can be resolved if thermal pressurization of the pore fluid is the slip-weakening mechanism. Our analysis indicates that a planar fault segment with an impermeable and narrow slip zone will become very unstable during slip and is likely to be the site of a seismic asperity.},

abstract = {A revised glaciation history of the northern foreland of the Swiss Alps is presented by summarising field evidence and chronologi- cal data for different key sites and regions. The oldest Quaternary sediments of Switzerland are multiphase gravels intercalated by till and overbank deposits (‘Deckenschotter'). Important differences in the base level within the gravel deposits allows the distin- guishing of two complex units (‘Höhere Deckenschotter', ‘Tiefere Deckenschotter'), separated by a period of substantial incision. Mammal remains place the older unit (‘Höhere Deckenschotter') into zone MN 17 (2.6–1.8 Ma). Each of the complexes contains evidence for at least two, but probably up-to four, individual glaciations. In summary, up-to eight Early Pleistocene glaciations of the Swiss alpine foreland are proposed. The Early Pleistocene ‘Deckenschotter' are separated from Middle Pleistocene deposition by a time of important erosion, likely related to tectonic movements and/or re-direction of the Alpine Rhine (Middle Pleistocene Reorganisation – MPR). The Middle-Late Pleistocene comprises four or five glaciations, named Möhlin, Habsburg, Hagenholz (uncertain, inadequately documented), Beringen, and Birrfeld after their key regions. The Möhlin Glaciation represents the most extensive glaciation of the Swiss alpine foreland while the Beringen Glaciation had a slightly lesser extent. The last glacial cycle (Birrfeld Glaciation) probably comprises three independent glacial advances dated to ca. 105 ka, 65 ka, and 25 ka. For the last glacial advance, a detailed radiocarbon chronology for ice build-up and meltdown is presented.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Four Mesozoic-Cenozoic palaeothermal episodes related to deeper burial and subsequent exhumation and one reflecting climate change during the Eocene have been identified in a study of new apatite fission-track analysis (AFTAR) and vitrinite reflectance data in eight Danish wells. The study combined thermal-history reconstruction with exhumation studies based on palaeoburial data (sonic velocities) and stratigraphic and seismic data. Mid-Jurassic exhumation (ca. 175 Ma) was caused by regional doming of the North Sea area, broadly contemporaneous with deep exhumation in Scandinavia. A palaeogeothermal gradient of 45 oC km-1 at that time may be related to a mantle plume rising before rifting in the North Sea. Mid-Cretaceous exhumation affecting the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone is probably related to late Albian tectonic movements (ca. 100 Ma). The Sole Pit axis in the southern North Sea experienced similar inversion and this suggests a plate-scale response along crustal weakness zones across NW Europe. Mid-Cenozoic exhumation affected the eastern North Sea Basin and the onset of this event correlates with a latest Oligocene unconformity (ca. 24 Ma), which indicates a major Scandinavian uplift phase. The deeper burial that caused the late Oligocene thermal event recognized in the AFTA data reflect progradation of lower Oligocene wedges derived from the uplifting Scandinavian landmass. The onset of Scandinavian uplift is represented by an earliest Oligocene unconformity (ca. 33 Ma). Late Neogene exhumation affected the eastern (and western) North Sea Basin including Scandinavia. The sedimentation pattern in the central North Sea Basin shows that this phase began in the early Pliocene (ca. 4 Ma), in good agreement with the AFTA data. These three phases of Cenozoic uplift of Scandinavia also affected the NE Atlantic margin, whereas an intra-Miocene unconformity (ca. 15 Ma) on the NE Atlantic margin reflects tectonic movements of only minor amplitude in that area. The study demonstrates that only by considering episodic exhumation as an inherent aspect of the sedimentary record can the tectonic evolution be accurately reconstructed.},

These results show that attempts to calibrate a uranium glass against an activation monitor in only a small number of irradiations may produce results radically discrepant from the true value. The importance of systematic errors in neutron dosimetry for fission-track dating is also discussed. An alternative zeta calibration approach is described, which circumvents absolute phi and lambdasub(f) evaluation: each dosimeter glass is calibrated repeatedly against zircon age standards from the Fish Canyon and Bishop tuffs, the Tardree rhyolite and Southern African kimberlites, to obtain empirical calibration factors zeta.},

abstract = {[1] We investigate the decrease in permeability, k, with depth, z, in the Oregon Cascades employing four different methods. Each method provides insight into the average permeability applicable to a different depth scale. Spring discharge models are used to infer shallow (z < 0.1 km) horizontal permeabilities. Coupled heat and groundwater flow simulations provide horizontal and vertical k for z < 1 km. Statistical investigations of the occurrences of earthquakes that are probably triggered by seasonal groundwater recharge yield vertical k for z < 5 km. Finally, considerations of magma intrusion rates and water devolatilization provide estimates of vertical k for z < 15 km. For depths > 0.8 km, our results agree with the power law relationship, k = 10(-14) m(2) (z/1 km)(-3.2), suggested by Manning and Ingebritsen [1999] for continental crust in general. However, for shallower depths (typically z less than or equal to 0.8 km and up to z less than or equal to 2) we propose an exponential relationship, k = 5 x 10(-13) m(2) exp (-z/0.25 km), that both fits data better ( at least for the Cascades and seemingly for continental crust in general) and allows for a finite near-surface permeability and no singularity at zero depth. In addition, the suggested functions yield a smooth transition at z = 0.8 km, where their permeabilities and their gradients are similar. Permeabilities inferred from the hydroseismicity model at Mount Hood are about one order of magnitude larger than expected from the above power law. However, higher permeabilities in this region may be consistent with advective heat transfer along active faults, causing observed hot springs. Our simulations suggest groundwater recharge rates of 0.5 less than or equal to u(R) less than or equal to 1 m/yr and a mean background heat flow of H-b approximate to 0.080-0.134 W/m(2) for the investigated region.},

abstract = {Theoretical models of compaction and porosity modification in sandstones during burial are discussed. Theory predicts that mechanical compaction is the dominant porosity reducing mechanism during burial from 0 to 2.5-3 km. Porosity-depth trends are at this stage mainly controlled by the stability of the grain framework and the effective stress. Time and temperature also influence the porosity-depth gradients at shallow to moderate depths, but are probably less important than effective stress and framework grain composition. At greater burial depths, below 2.5-3 km, chemical compaction, including pressure solution, can explain most of the porosity reduction in well sorted clean arenites. Theoretical modelling of the intergranular pressure solution suggests that sandstones may lose porosity rapidly by this mechanism below 2.5-3 km and that factors capable of retarding pressure solution and quartz cementation are required to maintain prospective porosities below 4 km. This theory and comparisons with empirical data from Jurassic sandstones from offshore Norway indicate that high porosity is favoured by (1) overpressures approaching the lithostatic pressure gradient, (2) a short residence time below 3 km burial, (3) coatings on grains of clay or microcrystalline quartz which prevent quartz dissolution and precipitation and (4) a high content of feldspar and early diagenetic secondary pores. Early hydrocarbon emplacement may retard quartz cementation and preserve porosity, but chemical compaction probably continues after oil emplacement, except at very high hydrocarbon saturations.},

In order to evaluate the main tectono-thermal characteristics, an overview of three most relevant geophysical parameters, namely heat flow density, the distribution of shallow seismicity, and the depth of the Mohorovicic boundary, over a much larger, so-called Circum-Adriatic region, extending from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Pannonian basin, is first given. The pattern and values of these parameters in the Adriatic Sea and just outside this area differ significantly from those of the outlying environment, and thus correspond roughly to the area known as the Adriatic microplate. Slovenia is situated at the northern rim of this geophysically diversified region. In the western part of the country, where the Dinarides and Southern Alps are situated, a good correlation has been found between the deeply lying Mohorovicic discontinuity, the low heat flow density, low temperatures at depth and a large negative Bouguer anomaly, whereas in the eastern part of Slovenia (the Pannonian basin) the rising mantle-crust boundary is associated with the high heat flow density, high temperatures at depth and a positive Bouguer anomaly. At the transition zone between the Southern Alps and the Dinarides, along the area of changing crustal thickness, a shallow seismicity belt is indicated. The only DSS profile in Slovenia, crossing the country in a SW-NE direction from Pula (Croatia) to Maribor, reflects the tectonic relations and seismicity between the Dinarides and the Pannonian basin.},

abstract = {The permeability of a sand shale mixture is analyzed as a function of shale fraction and the permeability of the two end-members, i.e., the permeability of a clay-free sand and the permeability of a pure shale. First, we develop a model for the permeability of a clay-free sand as a function of the grain diameter, the porosity, and the electrical cementation exponent. We show that the Kozeny-Carman-type relation can be improved by using electrical parameters which separate pore throat from total porosity and effective from total hydraulic radius. The permeability of a pure shale is derived in a similar way but is strongly dependent on clay mineralogy. For the same porosity, there are 5 orders of magnitude of difference between the permeability of pure kaolinite and the permeability of pure smectite. The separate end-members' permeability models are combined by filling the sand pores progressively with shale and then dispersing the sand grains in shale. The permeability of sand shale mixtures is shown to have a minimum at the critical shale content at which shale just fills the sand pores. Pure shale has a slightly higher permeability. Permeability decreases sharply with shale content as the pores of a sand are filled. The permeability of sand shale mixtures thus has a very strong dependence on shale fraction, and available data confirm this distinctive shale-fraction dependence. In addition, there is agreement (within 1 order of magnitude) between the permeabilities predicted from our model and those measured over 11 orders of magnitude from literature sources. Finally, we apply our model to predict the permeabilities of shaly sand formations in the Gulf Coast. The predictions are compared to a data set of permeability determination made on side-wall cores. The agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data is very good.},

abstract = {Detrital thermochronometer data collected from modern rivers or sedimentary basins have the potential to record the evolution of topographic relief, fault kinematics and erosion within drainage basins. However, few studies have addressed the effects of these different factors on detrital thermochronometer age distributions. Here we use transient 3-D thermokinematic and landform evolution models to simulate the effects of time-varying topography and fault kinematics on the thermal field through which detrital samples cool. Cooling-rate-dependent apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe), zircon fission track and muscovite 40Ar/39Ar (MAr) grain age distributions are predicted for samples collected from modern river and basin sediments. These distributions are interpreted to determine the sensitivity of different thermochronometer systems to denudation and deformation histories in drainage basins of varying size. We find that detrital thermochronometers in rapidly eroding regions have a strong sensitivity to the kinematics of exhumation, but lack sensitivity to changes in topographic relief under most conditions. In addition, we find potential for significant overestimation of denudation rates derived from conventional 1-D age-elevation relationships as compared to 3-D model-prescribed rates. At rapid ({\^{a}}ˆ¼2.5 mm/y) model-prescribed denudation rates, 1-D techniques predict rates that are {\^{a}}ˆ¼5 and {\^{a}}ˆ¼2 times greater than the 3-D model rate for the AHe and MAr systems, respectively. In models that explore age distributions in foreland basin sediments, we confirm that the lag time concept is a useful and reliable means for identifying denudation rate changes as no significant change in lag time occurs for changing topographic relief scenarios.},

abstract = {Bottom-hole temperature (BHT) data measured in oil and gas wells constitute a large, low quality set of temperature observations commonly used in geothermal studies. Raw BHT data are, on the average, cooler than true formation temperatures. To estimate true formation temperatures, corrections must be applied. Empirical BHT corrections may be applied to BHT data for which only depths of measurement are known, but may not be valid outside of the area for which they are calibrated. If multiple BHT measurements from successive logging runs are available, the Horner plot correction procedure can be used. The accuracy of the Horner plot is limited by simplifying assumptions made in its derivation, and by the common lack of information on parameters such as duration of mud circulation. More detailed and complete treatments provide insight into the borehole equilibration process, but their application is similarly limited by a common lack of data regarding borehole thermal properties. A new type of empirical correction procedure may be derived in some areas and allows a correction to be made for BHTs for which only a depth and time of measurement are known. Noise is invariably present in the BHT data found on well log headers from oil and gas wells, and the consequence of noise in these data should be considered when choosing and applying a correction. Although the average nature and magnitude of error in raw BHT data may be approximately known, application of all BHT correction procedures to the typical data available from oil and gas well log headers usually involves an unknown amount of error. Reliable estimates of average geothermal conditions can be made only from suites of BHT data, and are condemned to be imprecise at best.},

The contribution of sediment loading to the subsidence has been evaluated and removed. Corrections for effects of compaction, water depth and changes of sea-level were also included. The remaining subsidence has been interpreted in terms of a simple thermal model for the cooling lithosphere. Based on this model a thickness of the thermal lithosphere of 113-139 km is estimated. The total subsidence and crustal thinning beneath the COST B-2 well are also estimated and used to place constraints on models for the origin of the margin.},

abstract = {A high-resolution, regional passive seismic experiment in the Rio Grande rift region of the southwestern United States has produced new images of upper-mantle velocity structure and crust-mantle topography. Synthesizing these results with geochemical and other geophysical evidence reveals highly symmetric lower-crustal and upper-mantle lithosphere extensional deformation, suggesting a pure-shear rifting mechanism for the Rio Grande rift. Extension in the lower crust is distributed over a region four times the width of the rift's surface expression. Here we propose that the laterally distributed, pure shear extension is a combined effect of low strain rate and a regionally elevated geotherm, possibly abetted by pre-existing lithospheric structures, at the time of rift initiation. Distributed extension in the lower crust and mantle has induced less concentrated vertical mantle upwelling and less vigorous small-scale convection than would have arisen from more localized deformation. This lack of highly focused mantle upwelling may explain a deficit of rift-related volcanics in the Rio Grande rift compared to other major rift systems such as the Kenya rift.},

The processes of SGD differ between the landward and offshore sides of the saltwater-freshwater interface. SGD in the nearshore can be mainly explained by connections of terrestrial groundwater, while offshore SGD is controlled mostly by oceanic process such as recirculated saline groundwater discharge. Global evaluations of SGD based solely on observational data (>25 000 automated flux measurements) showed that fresh groundwater discharge is estimated to be 2600 km3/year (from the coast to 200 m offshore) and is equivalent to 7% of the global river flux.

abstract = {Alkaline magmatism in far W Texas extended from 48 to 16 Ma ago, peaking in volume during the interval 37-26 Ma when all the felsic rocks were emplaced. Primitive magmas are rare, if not entirely lacking, but ne- and {ol+hy}-normative hawaiite and mugearite liquids (Ni <120 ppm; 100Mg/(Mg+Fe)<66) erupted through the entire time span. These evolved through ne-normative and q-normative trachytes to phonolite and rhyolite, including peralkaline varieties of both. Mafic q-normative rocks are distinctly subordinate.Transition from a contractional to an extensional regime occurred between 32 and 30 Ma ago, after which Trans-Pecos magmatism was almost exclusively mafic. Major- and trace-element compositions show gradation south-westward to the calc-alkaline rocks of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico, which were erupted from 35 to 28 Ma ago. This compositional gradient suggests that the alkaline and calc-alkaline rocks were all related to subduction of the Farallon plate. The Trans-Pecos province is not a continental rift, and probably is not a product of back-arc spreading. Peralkaline phonolites and rhyolites in Texas and calc-alkaline rhyolites in Mexico were erupted at the same time and probably in the same stress regime, and their compositional differences must reflect differences in source rocks and conditions of melting. },

Analysis of the model equations and numerical experiments demonstrate quasi-linear systems behaviour and show that rates of land subsidence due to compaction: (i) can attain a significant fraction (\textgreater40%) of the long-term sedimentation rate; (ii) are hydrodynamically delayed with respect to sediment loading. The delay is controlled by a compaction response time $\tau$c that can reach values of 10-5-107 yr for thick shale sequences. Both the behaviour of single sediment layers and multiple-layer systems are analysed. Subsequently the model is applied to the coastal area of the Netherlands to illustrate that lateral variability in compaction-derived land subsidence in sedimentary basins largely reflects the spatial variability in both sediment loading and compaction response time. Typical rates of compaction-derived subsidence predicted by the model are of the order of 0.1 mm/yr but may reach values in excess of 1 mm/yr under favourable conditions.},

abstract = {Direct measurements of groundwater seepage show the importance of subaqueous discharges as sources of fresh water and of dissolved chemicals to lakes and the coastal oceans. The rate of seepage decreases rapidly offshore; an analytical solution was developed that describes the discharge. In addition to variations due to the in homogeneities in the aquifer, seepage into the coastal ocean involves some recirculation of the salt water. In Great South Bay, New York, measured fluxes were as great as 150 L/sq m/day. The discharge near the shore was typically 50 L/sq m/day, decreasing to 30 L/sq m/day at a distance of 100 m offshore. Secondary convection due to an unstable density structure at the sediment-water interface may also be superimposed on the seepage distribution. Fingers of salt should be capable of carrying marine water many decimeters downward against the fresh groundwater advection. As a result, care must be exercised in interpreting direct measures of seepage flux to recognize the contribution of recirculated seawater.},

Each log-normal sub-population may be related to a different mode of sediment transport and deposition, thus providing a measure of their importance in the genesis of a sand unit. The three modes of transport reflected are: (1) suspension; (2) saltation; and (3) surface creep or rolling. Each of these is developed as a separate sub-population within a grain size distribution. The number, amount, size-range, mixing, and sorting of these populations vary systematically in relation to provenance, sedi- mentary process, and sedimentary dynamics. The analysis of these parameters is the basis for determining the process-response characteristics of individual sand units. A number of processes are uniquely reflected in log-probability curves o$\sim$ grain size distributions of sands and sandstones. These include: (1) current; (2) swash and backwash; (3) wave; (4) tidal channel; (5) fallout from suspension; (6) turbidity current; and (7) aeolian dune. The combination of two or more of these processes also produce characteristic log-probability curve shapes. Ancient sands show some differences from their modern analogues, but these are usually minor. Log- probability plots of ancient sands are directly comparable to those from modern sands. The principal limita- tion of this study is in comparing sands formed under comparable conditions and obtaining an independent determination of the processes of formation of ancient sands.},

abstract = {The northern Upper Rhine Graben, situated in the central part of the European Cenozoic rift system, is currently characterized by low intra-plate seismicity. Historical earthquakes have not been large enough to produce surface rupturing. Moreover, the records of Quaternary surface processes and human modifications are presumably better preserved than the record of the relatively slow tectonic deformation.In order to gain information on the neotectonic activity and paleoseismicity in this setting, the geological and geomorphological records of fault movements along a segment of the Western Border Fault (WBF) were studied using an integration of techniques in paleoseismology, structural analysis and shallow geophysics. The WBF segment investigated follows a 20 km long linear scarp of unclear origin. A series of geophysical measurements were performed and the results suggested that near-surface deformation structures are present at the segments' southern end. Several trenches opened at this location revealed fault structures with consistent extensional style and a maximum vertical displacement of 0.5 m. In one trench, the deformation structures were dated between 19 and 8 ka. Assuming the deformation has been caused by an earthquake, a Mw 6.5 earthquake would be implied. Aseismic deformation would point to a fault creep rate ≥ 0.04 mm/yr.A reconstruction of the sequence of events at the trench site, from Middle Pleistocene to Present, demonstrates that the morphology at the base of the scarp is the result of interplay between tectonic activity and fluvial and erosional processes. At the regional scale, a mixed origin for the WBF scarp is proposed, combining the effects of fluvial dynamics, erosion, regional uplift and localized tectonic activity on the WBF.},

abstract = {Coupling between deformation processes and rock permeability is a major factor influencing fluid migration and fluid-rock interaction during the formation of mesothermal lode gold systems in mid- to upper crustal regimes. The evolution of permeability during deformation is controlled by a dynamic competition between deformation-induced porosity creation processes and porosity destruction processes. Localization of deformation in faults and shear zones leads to flow localization, with large scale flow systems forming when active faults and shear zones link to create percolation networks. Broad regions of fluid focusing develop around the upstream segments of active shear networks and fluid discharge regions develop in the downstream parts of these systems.  The architecture of flow within shear networks is influenced by the relative proportions of backbone, dangling and isolated structures within the network. Connectivity in the network may increase with growth of the shear network, but is expected to continually change as the locus and intensity of deformation changes. The typical distribution of mesothermal lode deposits within crustal scale shear networks indicates that mesothermal systems might develop most efficiently in networks that are close to the percolation threshold, i.e. with most flow occurring along a flow backbone forming only a small part of the total shear network. Dangling elements adjacent to the backbone, particularly in the downstream (discharge) parts of the system, provide some of the best potential for gold deposition by fluid-rock interaction processes.  Contrasting styles of fluid flow are expected between the seismogenic and aseismic regimes of the shear- or fault-hosted hydrothermal systems associated with mesothermal lode gold formation. Below the seismic-aseismic transition, creep processes can lead to near-steady state permeabilities and produce continuous fluid flow regimes. In the seismogenic regime, large cyclic changes in fault permeability, fluid pressures and fluid flux occur during the seismic cycle, and lead to fault-valve behaviour and episodic fluid flow. The seismogenic regime allows for a richer variety of gold deposition processes than is generally available in the aseismic regions of hydrothermal systems associated with lode gold formation.},

In the fluid-discharge areas, temperatures are modeled to have reached 300 degrees C within the coal measures section and would have generated anthracite, while more internal parts of the basin were cooled by descending fluid flow, and temperatures of only 220 degrees C resulted, sufficient to form bituminous coal. The modeled thermal regime appears to match the pattern of coal rank observed in the basin. The regional flow probably continued for 1 to 2 m.y. before erosion diminished the topographic gradient driving brine migration in the late Paleozoic.},

abstract = {The c . 2.97-2.71 Ga Witwatersrand Basin located in the Kaapvaal craton of South Africa represents a remnant of a large Late Archaean sedimentary basin that hosts the world's premier gold deposit within a series of conglomerate horizons. Evidence of postdepositional gold mobility within these conglomerates associated with hydrothermal-metamorphic activity has led to speculation about the Late Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic geothermal gradients in the basin. We use surface heat flow and heat production data from rocks in the basin and its environs in order to calculate detailed temperature profiles for the central Kaapvaal craton that show that the steady state crustal geotherm during the Late Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic was relatively cool at 15-20 K km(-1) . The geotherm in the upper crustal strata is also largely unaffected by substantial increases in the heat flow into the base of the crust. Consequently, regional greenschist facies metamorphism of the basin sediments could only have been achieved during a transient thermal event that advected heat into the upper crust. The most likely candidate for this is the Bushveld magmatic event at 2.06 Ga.},

abstract = {Our new 1-by-1 degree global crustal model, CRUST1.0, was introduced last year and serves as starting model in a comprehensive effort to compile a global model of Earth's crust and lithosphere, LITHO1.0 (Pasyanos et al., 2012). The Moho depth in CRUST1.0 is based on 1-degree averages of a recently updated database of crustal thickness data from active source seismic studies as well as from receiver function studies. In areas where such constraints are still missing, for example in Antarctica, crustal thicknesses are estimated using gravity constraints. The compilation of the new crustal model initially followed the philosophy of the widely used crustal model CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000; http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/$\sim$gabi/crust2.html) to assign elastic properties in the crystalline crust according to basement age or tectonic setting (loosely following an updated map by Artemieva and Mooney (2001; http://www.lithosphere.info). For cells with no local seismic or gravity constraints, statistical averages of crustal properties, including crustal thickness, were extrapolated. However, in places with constraints the depth to basement and mantle are given explicitly and no longer assigned by crustal type. This allows for much smaller errors in both. In each 1-degree cell, boundary depth, compressional and shear velocity as well as density is given for 8 layers: water, ice, 3 sediment layers and upper, middle and lower crystalline crust. Topography, bathymetry and ice cover are taken from ETOPO1. The sediment cover is based on our sediment model (Laske and Masters, 1997; http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/$\sim$sediment.html), with some near-coastal updates. In an initial step toward LITHO1.0, the model is then validated against new global surface wave disperison maps and adjusted in areas of extreme misfit. This poster presents the next validation step: compare the new Moho depths with in-situ active source and receiver function results. We also present comparisons with CRUST2.0. CRUST1.0 is available for download.

While porosity?permeability relationships of pure clays and pure sands have been relatively well established at the laboratory scale, the permeability of natural sediments remains highly uncertain. This chapter quantifies how well permeability of sand?clay mixtures can be predicted using simple mixing models and information on porosity, grain size, and clay content that are frequently available in sedimentary basins or can be inferred from sample descriptions or well?log data. It evaluates how well a number of existing porosity?permeability equations such as the Kozeny?Carman equation fit a compilation of data on the permeability of pure sands and clays. Data on the permeability of pure clays were obtained from several experimental studies in which porosity and permeability were measured during compaction experiments.},

abstract = {To date, igneous rocks, either intrusive or extrusive, have been encountered in the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary series of the Netherlands in some 65 exploration and production wells. Following 17 new isotopic K/Ar age determinations of the recovered rock material (amounting to a total of 28 isotopic ages from 21 different wells), analysis of the stratigraphy distribution of the penetrated igneous rock bodies showed that the timing of their emplacement was importantly controlled by orogenic phases involving intra-plate wrench and rift tectonics. Magmatism coincided with the Acadian (Late Devonian), Sudetian (early Late Carboniferous), Saalian (Early Permian), Early Kimmerian (late Late Triassic), Mid-Kimmerian (Late Jurassic), Late Kimmerian (earliest Cretaceous) and Austrian (latest Early Cretaceous) tectonic phases. This synchroneity presumably reflects (broadly) coeval structural reorganizations of respectively the Baltica/Fennoscandinavia-Laurentia/Greenland, Laurussia-Gondwana, African-Eurasia and Greenland/Rockall-Eurasia plate assemblies. Through their concomitant changes of the intra-plate tectonic stress regime, inter-plate motions induced intra-plate tectonism and magmatism. These plate-tectonics related events determined the tectonomagmatic history of the Dutch realm by inducing the formation of localized centres, as well as isolated spot occurrences, of igneous activity. Some of these centres were active at (about) the same time. At a number of centres igneous activity re-occurred after a long period of time.},

abstract = {Two abiding issues impact the reliability of apatite Þ ssion-track analysis and thermal history inver- sion in particular: reproducibility of track-length measurements and variability of annealing kinetics. In the companion to this paper, we addressed the Þ rst by demonstrating that using c-axis projection to normalize track lengths for crystallographic angle improves reproducibility among measurements acquired by Barbarand et al. (2003a, 2003b). We continue here by looking at the effect of c-axis projection on extrapolation of laboratory measurements to geological time scales. We Þ nd that c-axis projection improves agreement between predictions of empirical annealing models Þ t to measurements by Barbarand et al. (2003b) analysts 1 and 3, further corroborating its effectiveness in ameliorating observer bias. Furthermore, these annealing models closely match predictions from the Carlson et al. (1999) annealing data set, which was obtained by a different analyst using a different etching protocol. Normalizing for angle thus allows us to create a single annealing model that encompasses both data sets and etching techniques. By combining the different compositional varieties of apatite in the two data sets, the resulting model provides an improved basis for estimating apatite kinetic properties in unknowns using proxies such as composition, etch-Þ gure dimension, and unit-cell parameters. Pre- dictions from a fanning curvilinear model form accord with conventional expectations of annealing at high and low temperatures, and its use for thermal history inversion will not introduce spurious late cooling events.},

abstract = {This paper describes the diagenetic evolution of clay minerals in the Rotliegend sandstone reservoir under contrasting burial histories in the Broad Fourteens basin (Dutch sector, Southern North Sea). The diagenetic modifications affecting the crystal structure of clay minerals (both kaolin-group and illitic minerals) were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD study includes oriented and random mounts of various size fractions, numerical processing (decomposition) of XRD profiles, and simulation of one-dimensional and three-dimensional XRD patterns. Petrographic observations, differential thermal analysis, K/Ar geochronology, and geochemical considerations complement the XRD study and allow determination of the sequence of mineral crystallization and the morphological evolution of clay minerals and place further constraints on the absolute timing of diagenetic events and on the nature of the fluids responsible for clay-mineral crystallization. From deposition time ( nearly equal 275 Ma) to the Kimmerian orogeny ( nearly equal 155 Ma), crystallization of kaolinite at the expense of K-feldspars was favored by acid fluids from the underlying Carboniferous Coal Measures source rocks; kaolinite crystallization is followed by a steady kaolinite-to-dickite transformation affecting both the structure and the morphology of kaolin-group minerals. The structural characteristics of kaolin-group minerals are related to the burial history of the sediments prior to the Kimmerian orogeny. During the Kimmerian orogeny, rapid illitization of kaolin-group minerals was favored both by increased heat flow in the sedimentary pile and by widespread presence of faults, which permitted significant fluid flow probably from the Zechstein Formation. The morphological and structural characteristics of illitic minerals, i.e., illite content of illite/smectite mixed layer (I/S), ratio of illite to I/S, and three-dimensional structure of illitic minerals, do not represent the progress of a smectite-to-illite transformation, but these characteristics clearly reflect the temperature during illitization of kaolin.},

abstract = {Until now, research on neotectonics and related seismicity has mostly focused on active plate boundaries characterized by generally high earthquake activity. Current seismic hazard estimates for intraplate areas are commonly based on probabilistic analyses of historical and instrumental earthquake data. The accuracy of these hazard estimates is limited by the nature of the data (e.g. ambiguous historical sources) and by the restriction of available earthquake catalogues to time scales of only few hundred years, which are geologically insignificant and not suitable to describe the tectonic processes causing earthquakes. This is especially relevant to intraplate regions where faults show slow slip rates resulting in long average recurrence times for large earthquakes (103-106 yr).The Alpine orogen and intraplate sedimentary basins and rifts of its northern foreland are associated with a much higher level of neotectonic activity than hitherto assumed. Seismicity and stress indicator data, combined with geodetic and geomorphologic observations, demonstrate that the northern Alpine foreland is being actively deformed. This has major implications for the assessment of their natural hazards and environmental degradation. The NW European lithosphere has undergone a polyphase evolution with an intensive interplay of upper mantle thermal perturbations and stress-induced intraplate deformation. A number of recent findings point to an important role of lithospheric folding in thermally weakened lithosphere of the northwestern European foreland.The EU funded interdisciplinary ENvironmental TECtonics research network (ENTEC) addresses relationships between deeper lithospheric processes, neotectonics and surface processes in the northern Alpine foreland. Its objectives are to quantify the effects of ongoing Alpine collision on NW European Foreland intraplate deformation and its impact on surface geomorphology and natural hazards. Three natural laboratories have been selected: (1) the Lower Rhine Graben (LRG), (2) the Upper Rhine Graben (URG), and (3) the Vienna Basin (VB). These three areas record the manifestation of neotectonics within the Alpine orogen (VB), at its front (URG) and in the far field area (LRG).},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Oxygen isotope ratios, whole rock major and trace element compositions, and petrological characteristics of 52 samples from nine distinct igneous lithologies in the lower plate of the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core complex of south-eastern California indicate that both mylonitic and non-mylonitic lithologies underwent exchange with surface-derived meteoric waters. Broadly granodioritic lithologies are characterized by whole rock $\delta$18O values that range from 10.6 to 2.6?. Isotopic compositions of quartz and feldspar mineral separates indicate that quartz has largely retained original igneous compositions but that feldspar has undergone variable and often large 18O-depletions (up to 6.5?). Over 4 km of structural relief is exposed in lower plate gneisses below the Whipple detachment fault including non-mylonitic lithologies at shallow structural levels above the mylonite front, and mylonitic gneisses at intermediate to deep levels below the mylonite front. Coupled $\delta$18Oqtz - $\delta$18OFsp systematics of non-mylonitic and mylonitic andesite to rhyolite dykes from shallow and intermediate structural levels of the lower plate document two episodes of hydrothermal alteration: a high-temperature (>c.600d?C) episode involving a metamorphic or magmatic fluid with $\delta$18O values ? 7? and a low-temperature (c.350d?C) episode involving low-$\delta$18O meteoric fluids. All the dykes that document exchange with meteoric fluids are non-mylonitic. Coupled $\delta$18OFsp systematics of non-mylonitic and mylonitic granodioritic gneisses from above and below the mylonite front also document low-temperature (c. 350d? C) exchange with meteoric fluids. The data indicate that infiltration of meteoric fluids occurred as lower plate lithologies were juxtaposed against the base of the faulted upper plate. High-angle normal faults in the upper plate served as the conduits for the downward circulation of surface-derived fluids. Meteoric fluids were able to penetrate across the detachment fault into the lower plate. Uplift rates coupled with independent cooling rates indicate that surface-derived fluids penetrated to a depth of c.4km and possibly as deep as c.8km. Penetration of surface-derived fluid into the ductile deformation regime is not required to explain the low $\delta$18O values observed in lower plate lithologies of the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core complex.},

abstract = {We numerically assess the relevance of power averaging as a means for permeability upscaling on a variety of 2D and 3D, dense, and sparse on-lattice networks. The power average exponent $\omega$ determined on a realization basis converges with the system size within the range of scales explored for all cases. Power averaging is strictly valid only for the 2D dense square case for which $\omega$ is equal to 0 with a numerical precision of 0.01 both for the lognormal and log-uniform permeability distributions consistently with the theoretical proof of Matheron (1967). For all other cases, the variability of $\omega$ with the local permeability distribution variance $\sigma$2 is nonnegligible but remains small. It is equal to 0.09 for sparse networks and 0.14 for dense networks representing 4.5% and 7%, respectively, of the full possible range of $\omega$ values. Power averaging is not strictly valid but gives an estimate of upscaling at a few percent. Here $\omega$ depends slightly on the local permeability distribution shape beyond its variance but mostly on the morphological network structures. Most of the morphological control on upscaling for on-lattice structures is local and topological and can be explained by the dependence on the average number of neighbor by points (effective coordination number) within the flowing structure (backbone).},

abstract = {The rise of fluid pressure along a fault plane can trigger an earthquake as shear strength decreases. Recent models have thus suggested that the rate of interseismic fluid-pressure increase may control earthquake recurrence. In electric-analog model simulations incorporating new experimental data on rock properties within the lower seismogenic zone, resultant fluid-pressure fluctuations are restricted to the fault plane, and are strongly attenuated during their slow propagation into the country rock. Fluid-pressure drops, triggered by coseismic fault dilation, require days to hundreds of years to propagate over distances ≥1 m into low-permeability country rock (≤10 m). The equilibration of fluid pressure between the faulted and the intact country rock requires tens to hundreds of years. If the fault seals prior to this equilibration, the fluid pressure recovers instantaneously to near the prefailure value. These results may imply that if elevated fluid pressure weakens transcrustal fault zones, they are likely to remain weak after earthquakes.},

abstract = {The permeability of sediments is a major control on groundwater flow and the associated redistribution of heat and solutes in sedimentary basins. While porosity–permeability relationships of pure clays and pure sands have been relatively well established at the laboratory scale, the permeability of natural sediments remains highly uncertain. Here we quantify how well existing and new porosity–permeability equations can explain the permeability of noncemented siliciclastic sediments. We have compiled grain size, clay mineralogy, porosity, and permeability data on pure sand and silt (n = 126), pure clay (n = 148), and natural mixtures of sand, silt and clay (n = 92). The permeability of pure sand and clay can be predicted with high confidence (R2 ≥ 0.9) using the Kozeny–Carman equation and empirical power law equations, respectively. The permeability of natural sediments is much higher than predicted by experimental binary mixtures and ideal packing models. Permeability can be predicted with moderate confidence (R2 = 0.26– 0.48) and a mean error of 0.6 orders of magnitude as either the geometric mean or arithmetic mean of the permeability of the pure clay and sand components, with the geometric mean providing the best measure of the variability of permeability. We test the new set of equations on detailed well-log and permeability data from deltaic sediments in the southern Netherlands, showing that permeability can be predicted with a mean error of 0.7 orders of magnitude using clay content and porosity derived from neutron and density logs.},

abstract = {We describe the Miocene petroleum system in the context of the geology of the Northern Apennines as a system fed by multiple sources including some potential for deep oil accumulation. The presence of sources deeper than the Miocene reservoir is required by the high thermal maturity of the oils, the thermogenic nature of methane and the high ion content, in the reservoir brines, deriving from decaying organic matter. This is in contrast with the lower thermal maturity measured in the Miocene reservoir coupled with its low organic matter content. A Miocene secondary source, however, is required by the presence of a Tertiary organic marker in the oil. The deeper sources charged reservoirs of different age, geometry and sediment provenance, mostly as a function of stepwise migration of the foredeep and the overlying Ligurian units toward the foreland, which provided rapid overburden. The porosity of the reservoir was preserved in the anticlines mostly because of up-dip migration into early formed structures in the foredeep units. Therefore, the structural evolution of the area, especially the time interval between deposition and deformation of the foredeep units, is crucial for the definition of the quality of the reservoirs. Finally, the Quaternary reactivation of the thrust sheets in the foothills changed the geometry of the reservoirs, inducing new accumulations and/or dismigration from deeper and older traps.},

abstract = {We present a summary of geophysical models of the subcrustal lithosphere of Europe. This includes the results from seismic (reflection and refraction profiles, P- and S-wave tomography, mantle anisotropy), gravity, thermal, electromagnetic, elastic and petro-logical studies of the lithospheric mantle. We discuss major tectonic processes as reflected in the lithospheric structure of Europe, from Precambrian terrane accretion and subduction to Phanerozoic rifting, volcanism, subduction and continent-continent collision. The differences in the lithospheric structure of Precambrian and Phanerozoic Europe, as illustrated by a comparative analysis of different geophysical data, are shown to have both a compositional and a thermal origin. We propose an integrated model of physical properties of the European subcrustal lithosphere, with emphasis on the depth intervals around 150 and 250 km. At these depths, seismic velocity models, constrained by body- and surface-wave continent-scale tomography, are compared with mantle temperatures and mantle gravity anomalies. This comparison provides a framework for discussion of the physical or chemical origin of the major lithospheric anomalies and their relation to large-scale tectonic processes, which have formed the present lithosphere of Europe.},

@article{Morgan1991,
abstract = {The transform fault concept is extended to a spherical surface. The earth's surface is considered to be made of a number of rigid crustal blocks. It is assumed that each block is bounded by rises (where new surface is formed), trenches or young fold mountains (where surface is being destroyed), and great faults, and that there is no stretching, folding, or distortion of any kind within a given block. On a spherical surface, the motion of one block (over the mantle) relative to another block may then be described by a rotation of one block relative to the other block. This rotation requires three parameters, two to locate the pole of relative rotation and one to specify the magnitude of the angular velocity. If two adjacent blocks have as common boundaries a number of great faults, all of these faults must lie on ‘circles of latitude' about the pole of relative rotation. The velocity of one block relative to the other must vary along their common boundary; this velocity would have a maximum at the ‘equator' and would vanish at a pole of relative rotation. The motion of Africa relative to South America is a case for which enough data are available to critically test this hypothesis. The many offsets on the mid-Atlantic ridge appear to be compatible with a pole of relative rotation at 62°N (±5°), 36°W (±2°). The velocity pattern predicted by this choice of pole roughly agrees with the spreading velocities determined from magnetic anomalies. The motion of the Pacific block relative to North America is also examined. The strike of faults from the Gulf of California to Alaska and the angles inferred from earthquake mechanism solutions both imply a pole of relative rotation at 53°N (±3°), 53°W (±5°). The spreading of the Pacific-Antarctic ridge shows the best agreement with this hypothesis. The Antarctic block is found to be moving relative to the Pacific block about a pole at 71°S (±2°), 118°E (±5°) with a maximum spreading rate of 5.7 (±0.2) cm/yr. An estimate of the motion of the Antarctic block relative to Africa is made by assuming closure of the Africa-America-Pacific-Antarctica-Africa circuit and summing the three angular velocity vectors for the cases above.},

abstract = {Geochemical and mass-balance constraints in conjunction with stable isotope data indicate that the copper deposit of Mount Isa (Australia) formed by mixing of a reduced sulfur-rich fluid from overlying Mount Isa Group metasedimentary rocks with a copper- rich oxidized fluid entering a brecciated contact zone from underlying metabasalts. We have performed numerical simulations to test whether the deposit may have formed by forced fluid convection driven by progressive displacement on the Mount Isa fault zone, indicated by an ∼200 °C offset in metamorphic grade. Results indicate that uplift of ≥1 mm/yr induces regional fluid flow organizing into a stable, permeability-controlled circulation system. Far-field advection through the oxidized metabasalts is superimposed on smaller-scale convection in the metasedimentary rocks beneath the fault. As convection on the large scale gains momentum, the breccia progressively cools, consistent with mineralogic and fluid-inclusion evolution. For realistic uplift rates, the measured silica enrichment in the orebody (≥190 Mt SiO) is achieved in ∼1 m.y. Reduced and oxidized fluids mix at the proportions required for high-grade copper-iron sulfide precipitation, aided by rapid oscillations in the influx ratio of the two fluids into the most permeable and vigorously convecting orebody region.},

abstract = {Jurassic shales and mudrocks from the Haltenbanken area offshore Norway and red claystones from Carboniferous and Permian intervals of Northern Germany were used in a study of the hydrocarbon sealing efficiency of elastic sediments. The investigations comprised geochemical and mineralogical analysis of the pelitic rocks, petrophysical characterisation by mercury poro- simetry and specific surface area measurements, and laboratory experiments to assess the transport properties with respect to both molecular transport (diffusion) and volume flow (Darcy flow). Effective diffusion coefficients of methane in the water-saturated rock samples at 150°C lay between 1.4x IO-” and 4.5x 10-‘ 0m2/s and showed a distinct correlation with TOC content. Permeability coefficients, measured by means of a steady-state method, ranged from < 1 nDarcy (4 loo*' m2) for Permian (Rotliegend) and Carboniferous red claystones up to 4.3 PDarcy (4.3 x 10$\sim$‘ 8m2) for a bioturbated Jurassic siltstone. The experimental data were used to calculate maximum sustainable gas and petroleum column heights, hydrocarbon leakage rates by pressure-driven volume flow (Darcy flow), and diffusive gas losses for simple, hypothetical scenarios. Computed maximum gas column heights range from 20m up to >2000m. Hydrocarbon column heights calculated on the basis of a rich con- densate lay between 3 and 340 m. Depending on temperature, pressure, reservoir geometry and seal thickness, diffusive losses can be expected to require tens of millions of years to significantly affect the contents of commercial size natural gas reservoirs.},

A residual gravity anomaly map, derived by subtracting the gravity effect of the sedimentary succession from the observed gravity anomaly field, reveals a distinctive continuous positive gravity anomaly trending NW-SE across the Netherlands that increases in amplitude towards the north-northwest, concordant with increasing sediment thickness. One profile crossing the main residual anomaly has been quantitatively modelled using a 2D inverse modelling program, the residual anomaly can be explained as the result of sources beneath the post-Carboniferous sedimentary succession, either in the crust or at the crust-mantle boundary.},

The geothermal gradients vary from 22 mKm-I to 44 mKm-l. Four sets of possible thermal conductivity values were used to calculate a range of heat flow values for each well. Generally low heat flow is observed in wells within the deeper portions of the basin and higher heat flow values occur in wells along the Aklavik Arch Complex which forms the southeastern margin of the basin. The contribution to heat flow by heat generation below the Mesozoic-Cenozoic basin fill sediments has been considered. The heat flow contribution from sub-Mesozoic sedimentary strata and underlying basement is highest along the basin-bounding Aklavik Arch Complex. The decrease in heat flow from below the basin fill sediments toward the basin depocenter may be related to basinward crustal thinning and corresponding reductions in intra-crustal radiogenic heat production.},

abstract = {Thermal rock properties were determined for the Northeast German Basin, a subbasin of the southern Permian basin in Europe. The new thermal data provide new aspects for the determination of heat flow and for hydrocarbon and geothermal resource evaluation in the basin. Thermal conductivity was measured on drill-core samples using the optical scanning method. Values for Permian and pre-Permian clastic rocks are variable (2.3ndash4.8 W/m/K) because of different depositional environments, compaction, and cementation reflected in lithology. PermianndashCarboniferous igneous rocks show lowest thermal conductivity in basalts (2.2 W/m/K) and highest (3.1 W/m/K) in granitoids. Anisotropy of thermal conductivity in all rocks is low. Formation thermal conductivity was determined by upscaling the values determined for single lithotypes. Radiogenic heat production was determined on drill cores for the upper Paleozoic sediments and igneous rocks. For the younger formations without sample control, a well-log approach was used. The heat production of sedimentary rocks is lowest (0.4 muW/m3) in the Permian (Zechstein) salt and anhydrite and highest (2.1 muW/m3) in the Permian (Rotliegende) clastic rocks. Heat production of the PermianndashCarboniferous rhyolites and granitoids is on the order of 2.6ndash3.8 muW/m3, and heat production of andesites and basaltoids is on the order of 0.9ndash1.9 and 0.1ndash0.7 muW/m3, respectively. The contribution to surface heat flow by these up to 2-km (1.2-mi)-thick igneous complexes amounts to 7 mW/m2 at a maximum. On the same order is the total heat budget provided by the supra-Permian sedimentary succession in the basin.},

abstract = {The saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil can be predicted using empirical relationships, capillary models, statistical models and hydraulic radius theories. A well-known relationship between permeability and properties of pores was proposed by Kozeny and later modified by Carman. The resulting equation is largely known under the name of Kozeny-Carman, although these authors never published together. In the geotechnical literature, there is a large consensus that the Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation applies to sands but not to clays. Such opinion, however, is supported only by partial demonstration. This report evaluates the background and the validity of the KC equation with laboratory permeability tests. Considered test results were taken from publications that provided all information needed to make a prediction: void ratio, and either the measured specific surface for cohesive soils, or the gradation curve for non-cohesive soils. This report shows how to estimate the specific surface of a non-cohesive soil from its gradation curve. The results presented here show that, as a general rule, the KC equation predicts fairly well the saturated hydraulic conductivity of most soils. Many of the observed discrepancies can be related to either practical reasons (e.g. inaccurate specific surface value, steady flow not reached, unsaturated specimens, etc.) or theoretical reasons (some water is motionless, and the predictive equation is isotropic whereas hydraulic conductivity is an anisotropic property). Theses issues are discussed in relation to the predictive capabilities of the KC equation.},

abstract = {Quartz is the most important porosity destroying cement in sandstone reservoirs. The large petrographic data sets, from 11 intervals from around the world, presented and referenced here, indicate that massive quartz cementation follows a predictable pattern. Cementation occurs in two distinct phases: an early minor phase during which a few percentage of authigenic quartz are precipitated, followed by the relatively abrupt start of massive deep burial cementation which can result in up to 20% reduction in porosity. Massive quartz cementation typically begins at 90 ± 10°C. The relative temperature dependence indicates some form of kinetic control. Computer modelling indicates that it is not possible to import large quantities of silica into the reservoir. Thus the source of silica for quartz cementation must be derived from within the sandstone or directly adjacent to it. The pattern of cementation strongly suggest sources which have a temperature and, in some cases, a stress dependence. Temperature-dependent silica contributing reactions probably include the dissolution of feldspars, the transformation of smectitic clay to illite and the dissolution of heavy minerals (although only a minor contributor in many circumstances). Pressure dissolution within sandstones and adjacent siltstones also becomes important over the same stress/temperature range, partly because the dissolution of framework grains will increase the stress on the remaining framework grains. Finally, fluid movement within a non-isothermal reservoir promotes redistribution of quartz.},

Development of this mega-rift was paralleled by orogenic activity in the Alps and Pyrenees. Major rift domes, accompanied by subsidence reversal of their axial grabens, developed 20-40 Ma after beginning of rifting. Uplift of the Rhenish Shield is related to progressive thermal lithospheric thinning; the Vosges-Black Forest and the Massif Central domes are probably underlain by asthenoliths emplaced at the crust/mantle boundary. Evolution of this rift system, is thought to be governed by the interaction of the Eurasian and African plates and by early phases of a plate-boundary reorganization that may lead to the break-up of the present continent assembly.},

@article{Obrien1999,
abstract = {During the latest Miocene and Early Pliocene ( 5.5. MaBP), the collision of the Australian and Eurasian plates resulted in proto-foreland development and significant structural reactivation in the Timor Sea, north-western Australia. Flexural extension, resulting from the down-warping of the Australian plate into the developing Timor Trough, resulted in the dilatation of the major Jurassic and older extensional faults and the formation of shallow Mio-Pliocene fault arrays. An integrated, multidisciplinary study of hydrocarbon traps from this region using 2-D and 3-D seismic data, stable isotope geochemistry, fluid inclusion measurements and apatite fission track data has revealed that this fault reactivation produced three categories of traps: high (HIT), moderate (MIT) and low (LIT) integrity traps. These have characteristic hydrocarbon fill-spill, fluid flow and thermal histories. In MITs and LITs, the dilatation was moderate to intense respectively, and allowed hot (90-130[deg]C), highly saline (200,000+ ppm salinity) brines from deep Palaeozoic evaporites to migrate up the reactivated faults and chemically and thermally affect the reservoir and shallower intervals. Apatite fission track data suggest that fluid migration lasted for between 100,000 and one million years in the case of the MITs, but for only 10,000-100,000 years in the LITs. This major fluid flow event resulted in the development of a prominent, localised Late Tertiary heating spike in the MITs, which can significantly affect the accuracy of modelled thermal histories. In the LITs, the thermal effect is less marked, due to the more transient nature of the fluid flow event. HITs were largely unreactivated and hence conduits for brine migration from depth were absent. Consequently, these traps are the most representative of the thermal histories of the source rock depocentres. Where MITS or LITs were charged, the associated loss of fault seal integrity facilitated hydrocarbon loss from the Mesozoic reservoirs, which co-migrated with the brines up through the Mio-Pliocene fault network. Upon entering a shallow, clastic aquifer system (the Eocene Grebe Formation), bacterial oxidation of the hydrocarbons liberated CO2 which, in turn, resulted in significant and very isotopically light carbonate cementation. This cementation produces sufficient acoustic impedance with the surrounding uncemented sands that it allows these hydrocarbon-related diagenetic zones (HRDZs) to be mapped seismically. Since both the size and acoustic response of the HRDZs are directly proportional to the amount of hydrocarbons that have leaked from the traps, their presence or absence provides a powerful indicator, predrill, of both trap integrity and the likely thermal regime that that traps have experienced. An important observation is that the leaky fault segments over partially breached traps typically only extended for 200-1000 m, whereas over the breached traps, leaky segments extended for 3000-5000 m. Consequently, exploration programs acquiring remote sensing geochemical data (such as geochemical sniffer and airborne laser fluorosensor (ALF) techniques), should have closely spaced line spacings if leaky, potentially commercial fields are to be detected reliably. Potential analogues exist between the processes documented during HRDZ formation, namely the mixing at shallow depths of basinal brines, hydrocarbons and connate waters, and processes occurring during the formation of Pb-Zn and other, low temperature ore deposits.},

Sediments and metasediments deposited originally in shallow marine environments can contain fluids with a very wide range of salinities, but they are commonly near twice seawater salinity or higher. With increasing metamorphic grade, a very wide range of salinities may develop, with the highest levels tracking halite saturation. Oceanic and accretionary prism sequences yield low-salinity fluids, close to seawater values, almost irrespective of metamorphic grade until extreme conditions are reached where removal of water may increase fluid salinity. The salinities of metamorphic fluids exert a fundamental control on both fluid phase equilibria and metal-transporting capability, and appear, to a large degree, to reflect the original presence or absence of highly saline formation waters and/or evaporites in the initial sedimentary sequence.},

abstract = {Analysis of numerous pollen diagrams from north and central Germany and from the adjacent lowlands of The Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Belarus have facilitated a regional comparison of the vegetation and climatic evolution from the beginning of the Early Weichselian glaciation to the Weichselian pleniglacial. Data from geological studies and analysis of fossil beetles and plant macroremains have been used to supplement the palaeoclimatic reconstruction.Up to the end of the Oerel Interstadial the palaeoclimate was characterised by increasing continentality. The winter temperatures in particular tended to fall continuously during the stadials and the interstadials of the Early Weichselian and early Pleniglacial. In the Br{\"{o}}rup and Odderade Interstadials summer temperatures where sufficiently high to enable boreal forests to grow, whereas in the Oerel Interstadial summer temperatures were such that tree growth was inhibited. It is probable that falling sea-level and the consequent extension northwards of the North Sea coast were the main causes of increasing continentality.In the latter part of the Pleniglacial, peat accumulation frequently took place and humic silts were deposited under lacustrine conditions. Correlation between various sites is extraordinarily difficult. Pollen diagrams from the so-called interstadials of the Glinde, Moershoofd Complex, Hengelo and Denekamp are similar to those of the known Early Weichselian stadials. It is proposed therefore that these interstadials should be called intervals, and that the term interstadial be reserved for climatic variations that result in distinctive pollen assemblages and which, in turn, reflect distinctive vegetation dynamics. Interstadials should be capable of being characterised on a biostratigraphical basis and it should be possible to establish correlations over considerable distances. According to this definition, the first three warm oscillations of the Weichselian glaciation in the central European lowlands are the Br{\"{o}}rup, Odderade and Oerel Interstadials. All other pleniglacial peat layers should be assigned the rank of interval. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

A conceptual model of perched water occurrences is discussed, and a series of comprehensive computer modeling studies on perched water at the site are presented. The model has been calibrated using perched water data observed in six boreholes, and reproduces water-perching conditions in the unsaturated zone of the mountain. Both steady-state and transient simulations have been conducted. The steady-state simulation results are in agreement with the observed perched water data, including water saturation and potential profiles and perched water elevations. Transient numerical pumping tests were performed using pumping testing data collected in the field from two boreholes. The numerical pumping test results match observed water levels collected during pumping and recovery periods. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Uplift of the area south of the Feldbiss Fault Zone forced the Meuse River to incise and, as a result, a flight of terraces was formed. Faults of the Feldbiss Fault Zone have displaced the Middle and Late Pleistocene terrace deposits. In this study, an extensive geomorphological survey was carried out to locate the faults of the Feldbiss Fault Zone and to determine the displacement history of terrace deposits. The Feldbiss Fault Zone is characterized by an average displacement rate of 0.041-0.047 mm a-1 during the Late Pleistocene. Individual faults show an average displacement rate ranging between 0.010 and 0.034 mm a-1. The spatial variation in displacement rates along the individual faults reveals a system of overstepping faults. These normal faults developed by reactivation of Paleozoic strike-slip faults. As fault displacements at the bases of the younger terrace deposits are apparently similar to the tops of the adjacent older terrace, the age of these horizons is the same within thousands of years. This implies that the model of terrace development by rapid fluvial incision followed by slow aggradation does apply for this area.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study determines the relationship between permeability and other petrophysical properties in synthetic mudstones as a function of vertical effective stress. Six brine-saturated clay slurries consisting of smectite and kaolinite were compacted in the laboratory under both controlled pore pressure and proper drained conditions. Porosity, permeability, bulk density, velocity (both Vp and Vs) and rock mechanical properties were measured constantly under increasing vertical effective stress up to 50 MPa. The results show that smectite-rich clays compact significantly less and have lower bulk density, velocity, permeability, bulk and shear modulus but higher Poisson's ratio compared to kaolinite-rich clays at the same effective stress. Kaolinite aggregates compacted to about 26% porosity at 10 MPa effective stress corresponding to about 1 km burial depth in a normally compacted basin, whereas a pure smectite aggregate has a porosity of about 46% at the same stress. The permeability of kaolinite aggregates varies between 0.1 mD and 0.001 mD, while that of smectite aggregates varies from 0.004 mD to 0.00006 mD (60 nD) at stresses between 1 MPa and 50 MPa. Permeabilities in clays show a logarithmic decrease with increasing effective stress, bulk density, velocity or decreasing porosity. At the same porosity or bulk density, permeabilities differ up to five orders of magnitude within the smectite–kaolinite mixtures. Applications of the Kozeny–Carman equation for calculating permeability based on porosity in mudstones will therefore produce highly erroneous results. The relationships between Vp, Vs, bulk and shear modulus to permeability also vary by up to four orders of magnitude depending on the clay compositions. Velocities or rock mechanical properties will therefore not be suitable to estimate permeability in mudstones unless the mineralogy and textural relationships are known. These experimental results demonstrate that smectite content may be critical for building up pore pressure in mudstones compared to kaolinite. The results help to constrain compaction and fluid flow in mudstones in shallower parts of the basins (<80–100°C) where mechanical compaction is the dominant process. These results may also have implications for waste disposal and engineering practice, including structural design and slope stability analysis.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that most hydrothermal systems discharging at the land surface are associated with faulting, and that the location, temperature and rate of discharge of these systems are controlled by the geometry and style of the controlling fault(s). Unfortunately, the transport of heat and fluid in fault-controlled hydrothermal systems is difficult to model realistically; although heterogeneity and anisotropy are assumed to place important controls on flow in faults, few data or observations are available to constrain the distribution of hydraulic properties within active faults. Here, analytical and numerical models are combined with geostatistical models of spatially varying hydraulic properties to model the flow of heat and fluid in the Borax Lake fault of south-east Oregon, USA. A geometric mean permeability within the fault of 7 × 10−14 m2 with 2× vertical/horizontal anisotropy in correlation length scale is shown to give the closest match to field observations. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that continuity of flow paths is an important factor in reproducing the observed behavior. In addition to providing some insight into possible spatial distributions of hydraulic properties at the Borax Lake site, the study highlights one potential avenue for integrating field observations with simulation results in order to gain greater understanding of fluid flow in faults and fault-controlled hydrothermal and petroleum reservoirs.},

abstract = {Abstract A set of ash layer samples within the uppermost Upper Freshwater Molasse (OSM) sediments (N and E of Frauenfeld, Switzerland)\nwas dated by apatite fission track (FT) means. The ages indicate an early Tortonian (perhaps latest Serravallian) eruption\nand sedimentation age of 11.5 ± 0.3 Ma. The age is in agreement with time constraints by Mammalian relicts which point to\nMN7-8. Due to the position of the ash layers close to the erosional gap and overlying Quaternary cover, the age represents\na maximum age for the cessation of OSM sedimentation in the Swiss Molasse Basin. However, the end of Molasse sedimentation\nin this region had not stopped before the cover of OSM sediments by volcanic ash layers at the H{\"{o}}wenegg volcano (southern\nGermany), an event further constrained by an apatite FT age of 9.8 (−0.7/+0.8) Ma from a hornblende-bearing ash layer at H{\"{o}}wenegg.\nAn isolated bentonitic ash layer occurring 25 km to the WSW of the main set of dated ashes (near Humlikon) has an age component\nidentical to the OSM ash layers near Frauenfeld. The age suggests a source for this material within the Hegau, but is too\nyoung to be related to the volcanic activity at the Kaiserstuhl.\n\nThe apatites from the ash layer samples show two distinct compositional populations, one very close to a Cl end member and\none with apatites of equal proportions of Cl and OH end member. These populations are interpreted to have possibly originated\nfrom at least two distinct igneous sources for the ashes, separated by their eruption site or eruption time or both. The distinct\ncompositional data on the volcanic apatites may provide a basis to clarify their origin in future work.},

abstract = {Several recent studies proposed an important increase in exhumation rate in the western European Alps since circa 5&#8211;4 Ma. In order to assess potential spatial differences in exhumation histories, we present new apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) ages from the central Aar Massif (Guttannen area, Switzerland) and the western Lepontine Dome (Formazza area, Italy). Internal U/Th zoning in apatites explains alpha-ejection-corrected AHe ages that are older than the corresponding AFT ages in this study. A qualitative interpretation of AFT and AHe age-elevation relationships suggests a two-phase (9&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;3 Ma) exhumation scenario affecting the central Alps, with a stronger expression of the Pliocene signal in the Formazza area. However, a quantitative evaluation of exhumation scenarios using the 3-D heat equation solver Pecube highlights the existence of several other likely scenarios, casting doubt on the validity of a qualitative interpretation of the age-elevation relationships. In Formazza, scenarios suggested by quantitative modeling include continuous denudation at a rate of &#8764;750 m/Ma and a one-step exhumation rate change from 300 to 1000 m/Ma at 5 Ma. In Guttannen, they include continuous denudation at a rate of &#8764;400 m/Ma with valley deepening and two periods of higher exhumation rate (increasing from 300 to 700 m/Ma repeatedly at 9&#8211;7 and at 5&#8211;3 Ma). Contingent upon further flexural isostatic modeling, the magnitude of exhumation recorded in the axial region of the Alps since circa 5 Ma does not appear sufficient to solely explain the denudation recorded in the North Alpine Foreland Basin.},

abstract = {Climatic instability during the late Pleistocene has been reflected in the pattern of groundwater recharge. This report summarizes palaeoclimate knowledge during the late Weichselian in Europe. During this period the majority of northern Europe was covered by thick ice sheets and permafrost, preventing aquifers from recharging. In contrast, southern Europe was generally free of these palaeoclimatic features. Palaeoclimatic information has been combined with isotope data to better understand the palaeorecharge conditions and recharge timing across the European continent. The 18O and 2H relationship shows latitudinal plus climatic influences. Radiocarbon data show that while southern European aquifers have generally been recharged continuously during the last 40,000 years, northern European aquifers typically show a recharge gap during the Last Glacial Maximum. Areas that underwent continuous recharge during the entire late Pleistocene period can also be distinguished from areas where recharge to aquifers was prevented during the Last Glacial Maximum. Finally, several examples are presented of melt-water recharge or subglacial recharge. The identification of such diversity in the groundwater palaeorecharge in Europe is of great importance for modellers developing management schemes for groundwater resources.},

It is suggested that this uplift pattern has resulted from thickening of the continental crust caused by flow in the lower crust which has been induced by cyclic surface loading caused by growth and decay of ice sheets and the associated global sea-level fluctuations. Observed uplift histories are modelled using a technique which incorporates increases in the strength of forcing of this process caused by step changes in the intensity of glaciations starting at 3.1, 2.5, 1.2, and 0.9 Ma.},

abstract = {The groundwater reservoir and its interaction with surface water facilitate lateral transport of continental water and energy. Current climate models do not account for long-distance groundwater flow between model cells but route the atmospheric surplus (precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET)) directly to stream discharge within a model grid cell. We ask how much water exits a river basin without ever passing through its surface outlet? What are the climatologic and geologic factors influencing this flux? To answer these questions, a separation of groundwater flow from river flow is necessary. We use the ratio of stream discharge (Qr) to basin recharge (R = P − ET) for this purpose; where Qr:R < 1, a basin is considered a groundwater exporter; and where Qr:R > 1, a basin is considered a groundwater importer. Here Qr is obtained from 39 years of U.S. Geological Survey Hydro-Climatic Data Network observed stream discharge from 1555 basins across the continental United States, and R (P − ET) is derived from 50 years of hydrologic simulation by the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. It was found that the Qr:R ratio deviates significantly from 1 across the continent. Detailed investigations of individual basins suggest that the deviations are primarily a function of geology, while climate and basin scale influence the magnitude of these deviations. Further, a marked incongruity between the surface and groundwater flow directions is apparent, suggesting that surface drainage is only partially indicative of subsurface flow regimes. The apparent significance of this long-distance groundwater flow component reinforces the need for inclusion of the groundwater reservoir in current water cycle and climate modeling efforts.},

abstract = {Nutrient input through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) rivals river inputs in certain regions and may play a significant role in nutrient cycling and primary productivity in the coastal ocean. In this paper, we review the key factors determining the fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) associated with SGD and present a compilation of measured rates. We show that, in particular, the water residence time and the redox conditions in coastal aquifers and sediments determine fluxes and ratios of N and P in SGD. In many coastal groundwater systems, and especially in contaminated aquifers, N/P ratios exceed those in river water and are higher than the Redfield ratio. Thus, anthropogenically driven increases in SGD of nutrients have the potential to drive the N-limited coastal primary production to P-limitation. River input of N and P to the coastal ocean has doubled over the past 50 yr. Results of a dynamic biogeochemical model for the C, N and P cycles of the global proximal coastal ocean (which includes large bays, the open water part of estuaries, deltas, inland seas and salt marshes), suggest that this has led to a factor 2 increase in primary production and biomass and a decline in water column N/P ratios, i.e. the system has become more N-limiting. With the same model, we show that an increase of SGD-N fluxes to ???0.7-1.1Tmolyr-1 (with a SGD N/P ratio of 100; equal to ???45-70% of pre-human riverine N-inputs) is required to drive the coastal ocean to P-limitation within the next 50 yr. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, planar faults are treated as discontinuities. These are implemented by an additional degree of freedom for fault heave, and a coupled continuum equation for zero-differential tilting across the fault. The 3-D finite-difference results have been tested for line loads, point loads and disc loads by analytical solutions, and for spatial variation in effective elastic thickness (EET) by 2-D finite-difference solutions. Fault-related flexure patterns are compared to the 2-D analytical broken-plate model developed by Vening-Meinesz (1950). We subsequently apply the 3-D fault model to investigate fault controlled 3-D basement geometries in Lake Tanganyika (East Africa). We show that our model is capable of predicting 3-D basement geometries, characteristically observed in rifted basins. The modelling results indicate that fault-controlled upper crustal flexure patterns are associated with low values for EET. A comparison with regional scale-model studies, showing a superposition of high EET flexure effects, supports a multilayered rheological control on continental rifting.},

Chemical, isotopic, and hydrologic observations were made nearby where groundwater could be sampled. In addition, similar observations along vertical profiles were made at stations within the lagoon. A thin lens of rapidly moving fresh groundwater overlies a regional thick body of nearly stagnant saline groundwater that is close to ocean water in chemical composition. These two chemically distinct groundwaters are separated by a thin zone of dispersion, and both are at or slightly beyond saturation with respect to calcite. Where these two end-member groundwaters mix to form the brackish dispersion zone, the resulting solution is undersaturated with respect to calcite. This was confirmed by mass transfer and isotopic modeling which show that the mixing of two solutions of different ionic strength, each saturated with respect to calcite, can result in an undersaturated solution. Model calculations indicate that as much as 1.23 mmol of CaCO3 may be dissolved per kilogram of water. We hypothesize that many of the cuspate beaches along the east coast of the Yucatan formed in this manner and that mixing of waters of different chemistry may be an important geomorphic process in similar geologic-hydrologic settings.},

abstract = {A quantitative procedure has been developed for calculating tectonic subsidence in fully lithified strata and has been applied to stratigraphic sections in the early Paleozoic miogeocline of the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains. The results indicate that tectonic subsidence along the inner edge of the miogeocline was controlled mainly by thermal contraction of heated lithosphere. Comparison of a palinspastically restored cross section of the inner part of the miogeocline with a cross section constructed from a two-dimensional stretching model suggests that thinned continental crust was present beneath the inner miogeocline. These results support the passive-margin model that has been proposed for the miogeocline. The extensive transgression onto the craton east of the miogeocline in Cambrian time, however, cannot be explained by subsidence processes operating within a passive margin, and the transgression could be evidence for a eustatic rise of sea level.The form of the tectonic subsidence curves strongly implies that cooling of the heated lithosphere, which was initiated at the time of breakup, could not have begun earlier than the latest Precambrian or earliest Cambrian (555 Ma to 600 Ma). Ages of 800 Ma to 900 Ma that have been assumed previously for rifting in the miogeocline are too old to have led directly to continental breakup. Scattered occurrences of mafic volcanics interlayered with arkosic sediments have been reported in the latest Precambrian to earliest Cambrian Hamill Group exposed in the middle to outer part of the miogeocline. These deposits may record the phase of rifting that immediately preceded formation of the proto-Pacific margin in the southern Canadian Rockies.},

Regional measured apatite fission-track ages cluster between 28 and 41 Ma to the south of the Carlin East deposit whereas measured ages are greater than $\sim$56 Ma to the north. The regional trend of the apatite fission-track ages and the pattern of gravity and magnetic anomalies suggest that the thermal center for gold mineralization along the Carlin trend was south of the Carlin East deposit, near the 37 Ma Welches Canyon stock. Modeling of apatite fission-track-age data on both sides of the Post fault indicates that the Little Boulder stock was approximately 35{degrees}C cooler at 40 Ma relative to similarly positioned samples in the Goldstrike stock. It is unclear whether this thermal history difference across the Post fault is due to post-40 Ma differential exhumation or differential heating across the fault at the time of gold mineralization. Comparison of apatite fission-track and whole-rock 40Ar/39Ar ages from altered dikes in the ore zone at Carlin East demonstrates that 40Ar/39Ar ages do not reflect the age of gold mineralization, whereas the apatite fission-track ages were completely reset at the time of hydrothermal activity.

abstract = {Abstract  Processing of gravity and magnetic maps shows that the basement of the Upper Rhine Graben area is characterized by a series of NE–SW trending discontinuities and elongated structures, identified in outcrops in the Vosges, Black Forest, and the Odenwald Mountains. They form a 40 km wide, N30–40 striking, sinistral wrench-zone that, in the Visean, shifted the Variscan and pre-Variscan structures by at least 43 km to the NE. Wrenching was associated with emplacement of several generations of plutonic bodies emplaced in the time range 340–325 Ma. The sub-vertical, NE–SW trending discontinuities in the basement acted as zones of weakness, susceptible to reactivation by subsequent tectonism. The first reactivation, marked by mineralizations and palaeomagnetic overprinting along NE–SW faults of the Vosges Mountains, results from the Liassic NW–SE extension contemporaneous with the break-up of Pangea. The major reactivation occurred during the Late Eocene N–S compression and the Early-Middle Oligocene E–W extension. The NE–SW striking basement discontinuities were successively reactivated as sinistral strike-slip faults, and as oblique normal faults. Elongated depocenters appear to form in association with reactivated Variscan wrench faults. Some of the recent earthquakes are located on NE–SW striking Variscan fault zones, and show sinistral strike-slip focal mechanisms with the same direction, suggesting also present reactivation.},

abstract = {The extension of the lithosphere, controlling the development of rifted basins, is driven by a combination of plate-boundary forces, frictional forces exerted on the base of the lithosphere by the convecting asthenosphere and deviatoric tensional stresses developing over upwelling branches of the asthenospheric convection system. Although mantle plumes are not a primary driving force of rifting, they play an important secondary role by weakening the lithosphere and by controlling the level of rift-related volcanic activity. A distinction between "active" and "passive" rifting is only conditionally justified. The extension of the lithosphere, depending on its rate and magnitude, and the potential temperature of the asthenosphere, can cause by adiabatic decompression partial melting of the lower lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. In rift systems, the level and timing of volcanic activity is highly variable. The lack of volcanic activity implies "passive" rifting. An initial "passive" rifting stage can be followed by a more "active" one during which magmatism plays an increasingly important role. Magmatic destabilization of the Moho may account for the frequently observed discrepancy between upper and lower crustal extension factors. Combined with evidence for thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere, this suggest that the volume of the lithosphere is not necessarily preserved during rifting as advocated by conventional stretching models. The structural style of rifts is controlled by the rheological structure of the lithosphere, the availability of crustal discontinuities that can be tensionally reactivated, the mode (orthogonal or oblique) and amount of extension, and the lithological composition of pre- and syn-rift sediments. Simple-shear extension prevails in rifts that subparallel the structural grain of the basement. Pure-shear extension is typical for rifts cross-cutting the basement grain. Pre-existing crustal and mantle-lithospheric discontinuities contribute to the localization of rift systems. The duration of the rifting stage of extensional basins is highly variable. Stress field changes can cause abrupt termination of rifting. In major rift systems, progressive strain concentration on the zone of future crustal separation entails abandonment of lateral rifts. Depending on constraints on lateral block movements, crustal separation can be achieved after as little as 9 My and as much as 280 My of rifting activity. Syn-rift basin subsidence is controlled by isostatic adjustment of the crust to mechanical stretching of the lithosphere, its magmatic inflation and thermal attenuation of the mantle-lithosphere. Post-rift basin subsidence is governed by thermal reequilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Deep-seated thermal anomalies related to syn-rift pull-up of the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary have decayed after 60 My by about 65% and after 180 My by about 95%. The magnitude of post-rift subsidence is a function of the rift-induced thermal anomaly and crustal density changes, the potential temperature of the asthenosphere and initial water depths. Intraplate stresses can have an overprinting effect on post-rift subsidence. Stretching factors derived from post-rift subsidence analyses must be corrected for such effects.},

abstract = {Oscillations in stress, such as those created by earthquakes, can increase permeability and fluid mobility in geologic media. In natural systems, strain amplitudes as small as 10−6 can increase discharge in streams and springs, change the water level in wells, and enhance production from petroleum reservoirs. Enhanced permeability typically recovers to prestimulated values over a period of months to years. Mechanisms that can change permeability at such small stresses include unblocking pores, either by breaking up permeability-limiting colloidal deposits or by mobilizing droplets and bubbles trapped in pores by capillary forces. The recovery time over which permeability returns to the prestimulated value is governed by the time to reblock pores, or for geochemical processes to seal pores. Monitoring permeability in geothermal systems where there is abundant seismicity, and the response of flow to local and regional earthquakes, would help test some of the proposed mechanisms and identify controls on permeability and its evolution.},

abstract = {The bending of aquitard like a plate due to aquifer pumping and compression is often encountered in many practical problems of subsurface flow. This reaction will have large influence on the release of the volume of water from the aquifer, which is essential for the planning and management of groundwater resources in aquifers. However, the groundwater flow induced by pumping in a leaky aquifer system is often assumed that the total stress of aquifer maintains constant all the time and the mechanical behavior of the aquitard formation is negligible. Therefore, this paper devotes to the investigation of the effect of aquitard bending on the drawdown distribution in a leaky aquifer system, which is obviously of interest in groundwater hydrology. Based on the work of Wang et al. (2004) this study develops a mathematical model for investigating the impacts of aquitard bending and leakage rate on the drawdown of the confined aquifer due to a constant-rate pumping in the leaky aquifer system. This model contains three equations; two flow equations delineate the transient drawdown distributions in the aquitard and the confined aquifer, while the other describes the vertical displacement in response to the aquitard bending. For the case of no aquitard bending, this new solution can reduce to the Hantush Laplace-domain solution (Hantush, 1960). On the other hand, this solution without the leakage effect can reduce to the time domain solution of Wang et al. (2004). The results show that the aquifer drawdown is influenced by the bending effect at early time and by the leakage effect at late time. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the aquifer compaction is sensitive only at early time, causing less amount of water released from the pumped aquifer than that predicted by the traditional groundwater theory. The dimensionless drawdown is rather sensitive to aquitard's hydraulic conductivity at late time. Additionally, both the hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquifer are the most sensitive parameters in influencing the predicted dimensionless drawdown. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Both phenomena are widespread and one or the other may be unnoticed and/or unanticipated in various temperature logs. As a consequence, it is often difficult to determine the relative impact of the two phenomena on the temperature-depth data at a site. A number of models for ground-water flow, ground surface temperature change, and a combination of the two processes, are fitted to two example temperature logs showing characteristic nonlinearity. Examples of the possible impact of one phenomenon on the parameters calculated for the other phenomenon demonstrate the potential interactive influence. The analysis can be used to estimate potential uncertainties in calculations of ground-water flow and ground surface temperature change from subsurface temperature data, and therefore how interpretations of ground-water flow and ground surface warming might be affected.

abstract = {Sand-rich injectites are a common attribute of clastic sedimentary successions, and they have received increased attention in the last decade by geoscientists and engineers dealing with shallow subsurface flow and retention of aqueous and hydrocarbon fluids. Injectites form due to fluidized flow of sediment-entraining fluids through high-permeability strata. Given that sediment entrainment is confined to high-permeability sediments with low horizontal effective stress and negligible cementation, the formation of sand-rich injectites is restricted to the first kilometre of burial, where sand-rich sediments are prone to fluidization and clay-rich sediments are generally more cohesive and may hydraulically fracture to allow the creation of injectites. When reviewing conditions that may lead to aqueous and hydrocarbon flow within this shallow section at velocities that may cause sand fluidization and injection, we can rule out geologic time-scale processes (disequilibrium compaction, hydrocarbon migration, and lateral pressure transfer) as plausible causes. This emphasizes the need for high-strain-rate processes to cause rapid fluid overpressuring and flow associated with sand injection. Earthquake-induced shaking, instantaneous loading and release of overpressured fluids along moving fault planes are the most likely causes of sand remobilization and injection and these processes may enforce each other during tectonic stress-release events. An additional mechanism that may trigger sand-rich injections is the mechanical failure of shallow oil accumulations, particularly as the fluidization velocity of sand entrained in oil can be several orders of magnitude lower than for sand entrained in aqueous fluids, particularly if the oil is biodegraded (and thus has a high dynamic viscosity). Flow of hydrocarbon gas is unlikely to cause sand injection, although gas dissolved in upward-flowing aqueous fluids may evolve at or near the surface as pressures in the aqueous phase drop.},

@article{Bourgeois2007,
abstract = {Abstract  The development of the Alpine mountain belt has been governed by the convergence of the African and European plates since
the Late Cretaceous. During the Cenozoic, this orogeny was accompanied with two major kinds of intraplate deformation in the
NW-European foreland: (1) the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS), a left-lateral transtensional wrench zone striking NNE-SSW
between the western Mediterranean Sea and the Bohemian Massif; (2) long-wavelength lithospheric folds striking NE and located
between the Alpine front and the North Sea. The present-day geometry of the European crust comprises the signatures of these
two events superimposed on all preceding ones. In order to better define the processes and causes of each event, we identify
and separate their respective geometrical signatures on depth maps of the pre-Mesozoic basement and of the Moho. We derive
the respective timing of rifting and folding from sedimentary accumulation curves computed for selected locations of the Upper
Rhine Graben. From this geometrical and chronological separation, we infer that the ECRIS developed mostly from 37 to 17 Ma,
in response to north-directed impingement of Adria into the European plate. Lithospheric folds developed between 17 and 0 Ma,
after the azimuth of relative displacement between Adria and Europe turned counter-clockwise to NW–SE. The geometry of these
folds (wavelength = 270 km; amplitude = 1,500 m) is consistent with the geometry, as predicted by analogue and numerical models,
of buckle folds produced by horizontal shortening of the whole lithosphere. The development of the folds resulted in ca. 1,000 m of rock uplift along the hinge lines of the anticlines (Burgundy–Swabian Jura and Normandy–Vogelsberg) and ca. 500 m of rock subsidence along the hinge line of the intervening syncline (Sologne–Franconian Basin). The grabens of the
ECRIS were tilted by the development of the folds, and their rift-related sedimentary infill was reduced on anticlines, while
sedimentary accumulation was enhanced in synclines. We interpret the occurrence of Miocene volcanic activity and of topographic
highs, and the basement and Moho configurations in the Vosges–Black Forest area and in the Rhenish Massif as interference
patterns between linear lithospheric anticlines and linear grabens, rather than as signatures of asthenospheric plumes.},

abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to show that groundwater is a general geologic agent. This perception could not, and did not, evolve until the system nature of basinal groundwater flow and its properties, geometries, and controlling factors became recognized and understood through the 1960s and 1970s. The two fundamental causes for groundwater's active role in nature are its ability to interact with the ambient environment and the systematized spatial distribution of its flow. Interaction and flow occur simultaneously at all scales of space and time, although at correspondingly varying rates and intensities. Thus, effects of groundwater flow are created from the land surface to the greatest depths of the porous parts of the Earth's crust, and from a day's length through geologic times. Three main types of interaction between groundwater and environment are identified in this paper, with several special processes for each one, namely: (1) Chemical interaction, with processes of dissolution, hydration, hydrolysis, oxidation-reduction, attack by acids, chemical precipitation, base exchange, sulfate reduction, concentration, and ultrafiltration or osmosis; (2) Physical interaction, with processes of lubrication and pore-pressure modification; and (3) Kinetic interaction, with the transport processes of water, aqueous and nonaqueous matter, and heat. Owing to the transporting ability and spatial patterns of basinal flow, the effects of interaction are cumulative and distributed according to the geometries of the flow systems. The number and diversity of natural phenomena that are generated by groundwater flow are almost unlimited, due to the fact that the relatively few basic types are modified by some or all of the three components of the hydrogeologic environment: topography, geology, and climate. The six basic groups into which manifestations of groundwater flow have been divided are: (1) Hydrology and hydraulics; (2) Chemistry and mineralogy; (3) Vegetation; (4) Soil and rock mechanics; (5) Geomorphology; and (6) Transport and accumulation. Based on such a diversity of effects and manifestations, it is concluded that groundwater is a general geologic agent.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional modelling study of sedimentation, fluid flow, and heat flow in the Baikal rift basin undergoing flank uplift and basin subsidence has been performed in order to understand the impact of these processes on the surface heat flow signal. Heat flow anomalies of different scales and magnitudes have been observed at the sediment surface of the lake Baikal basin, and the presence of a hydrothermal vent suggests that fluids play an important role in the regional distribution of heat flow. The BASIN-code applied for this study allows to simulate topographically and compaction-driven hydrodynamical fluid flow and coupled heat transfer.The flank uplift history provides the basis for a regional groundwater circulation towards the central basin area, with predicted Darcy velocities at present-day situation in the basement varying between 1 and 100 cm/year. Within the basin, the presence of aquifers and the pinch-out layering has a major control on the flow field, and compaction-driven flow velocities are strongly altered when combined with topography-driven flow. When velocities in the basement are larger than several centimeters per year, the regional fluid circulation is an effective mechanism of heat redistribution. Heat is brought from the flanks towards the basin area, with largest heat transported at a depth of 1-2 km at both sides. During the flank uplift, heat advection increases, with secondary variation related to the deposition of sedimentary layers. The heat flow is increased over the basin and reduced in the flanks, with a total heat output balance always positive. The extra heat output over the modelled transection is 2-10% of the initial heat output. The maximum computed heat fluxes are smaller than measured in the heat flow anomalies of the lake Baikal basin. Nevertheless, the model suggests that flow in the sedimentary basin combined with a topographically driven heat advection in the surrounding basement is a sufficient mechanism to account for the increased heat flow over the basin and the main features of the heat flow distribution.},

In spite of extreme present-day burial depths of 4580 to 5280 m, the Rotliegend sandstones are characterized by moderate permeabilities which are controlled, together with their reservoir qualities, by omnipresent illite. It is admitted that deep-crustal hydrothermal fluids, migrating along major fault systems, interacted with the Carboniferous Coal Measures and generated acidic fluids inducing primary leaching processes, mass transfers and concomitant pervasive clay authigenesis. The investigated samples belong to wells located in a horst-graben structure covering an area of 20 by 20 km. This restricted area allowed investigation of a three-dimensional distribution of fluid flows and related illitization in distinct sandstone reservoirs. The K-Ar ages of the < 2 $\mu$m fractions decrease from 210-180 Ma (11 analyses with a mean at 198 Ma) for illite in the horst position to 190-155 Ma (24 analyses with a mean at 177 Ma) for illite in the graben area up to about 4 km away from faults, suggesting a relationship between timing of illite formation and structural position of the host rocks. The decrease in the illite K-Ar ages from the horst into the graben allowed calculation of a migration rate of 0.2 $\mu$m per year for the illitization front in the Rotliegend sandstones towards the centre of the graben, which might be of use for prediction of the illite distribution in these rocks.},

abstract = {Cambrian sandstones on Bornholm (Denmark) are tightly cemented by quartz. Cementation occurred after deep burial as evidenced by a very strong compaction, partly mediated by intensive grain fracturing. The quartz cement has a complex cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL)-zonation which is related to variable substitution of Al in the quartz lattice. Based on the substitution pattern and SEM-CL-zonation, three phases of quartz growth can be identified. Phase 1 cement has a low SEM-CL-level and its volume corresponds approximately to the estimated volume of press-solved detrital quartz. It is related to the late compaction. Phase-2 cement is the volumetrically most important. It has an intricate SEM-CL-zonation and associated Al-substitution. It is referred to hydrothermal activity related to the Permo–Carboniferous magmatic and tectonic event. The cementation gradually reduced the influence of hydrothermal flow, and late Phase-3 cement has a low-intensity and more simple SEM-CL-pattern. The almost fully cemented sandstone was fractured and the fractures were filled by hydrothermal chlorite, sulphides and quartz. These minerals are also found sporadically as cement in the sandstones.},

abstract = {Apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He thermochronological data provide new constraints on the timing of faulting and exhumation of the Wassuk Range, western Nevada, where east dipping normal faults have accommodated large-magnitude ENE-WSW oriented extension. Extensional deformation has resulted in the exhumation of structurally coherent fault blocks that expose sections of preextensional mostly granitic upper crust in the Grey Hills and central Wassuk Range. These fault blocks display westward tilts of ∼60° and expose preextensional paleodepths of up to ∼8.5 km, based on the structural reconstruction of tilted preextensional Tertiary andesite flows that unconformably overlie Mesozoic basement rocks. Apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He thermochronological data from the fault blocks constrain the onset of rapid footwall exhumation at ∼15 Ma. Fission track modeling results indicate rapid fault block exhumation occurred between ∼15 and 12 Ma, which is in agreement with Miocene volcanic rocks that bracket the tilting history. In addition, fission track and (U-Th)/He data suggest reduced rates of cooling following major extension, as well as renewed cooling related to active, high-angle faulting along the present-day range front starting at ∼4 Ma. Thermochronological data from structurally restored fault blocks indicate a preextensional Miocene geothermal gradient of 27° ± 5°C/km. The thermochronological constraints on the timing of extensional faulting and the eruptive history in the Wassuk Range imply a model for extension where crustal heating and volcanism precede the onset of rapid large magnitude extension, and where synextensional magmatism is suppressed during the highest rates of extension.},

abstract = {Deep groundwater flow can be driven by several mechanisms in sedimentary basins. In the case of evolving foreland basins, large-scale compression and thrusting could develop abnormally high pressures in the foreland sag that would initiate transient fluid flow. The so-called tectonic “squeegee” effect is thought to have caused basin-wide migration of ore-forming brines and hydrocarbons (Oliver, 1986). Two-dimensional numerical models are developed here to quantify the role of compressional tectonics in driving regional fluid flow in the later stages of thrusting in a foreland basin. Poroelasticity theory coupled with regional groundwater flow form the basic elements of the mathematical model. We use the mathematical model to predict deformation and pressure dissipation in the unfaulted and nonfolded part of a foreland basin in front of a thrust belt as it is subjected to an instantaneous loading event. Sets of numerical experiments show that overpressure zones develop along the leading edge of the thrust belt near the loading front. Stress-induced flow rates of the order of centimeters to meters per year are possible soon after compression of the foreland, and transient flow fields dissipate in about 103 and 104 years. Longer transients can exist in very low permeability strata. Large overpressures may be unable to buildup under conditions of gradual thrusting, as fluid pressures may dissipate too quickly. The general features of tectonically driven flow are also explored through a sensitivity study to consider effects of permeability, fault and stratigraphic heterogeneity, loading magnitude, and variations in rock compressibility. The sensitivity study is based mostly on numerical experiments. As these solutions suffered from stability problems in cases where bulk rock compressibility exceeded 10−9 Pa−1, some simple scaling arguments are used to extend the numerical results for squeezing of soft shale. One basin-specific application to the Ouachita orogen suggests that tectonic squeezing could have caused transient flow systems with relatively large flow velocities in basal Cambro-Ordovician aquifers. The volume of fluid expelled, however, is probably only a small fraction of the total brine volume needed to have formed the huge Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc ore deposits fringing the northern margin of the Arkoma Basin on the Ozark Uplift.},

Here we examine the transition from conduction dominated environments to environments where advection has a significant effect on the subsurface temperature regime and thus ground surface temperature (GST) histories. We provide guidelines indicating when advection is important and conclude that it is unlikely that groundwater flow is a significant source of error in the global data set maintained by the International Heat Flow Commission.},

abstract = {Metamorphic devolatilization generates fluids at, or near, lithostatic pressure. These fluids are ultimately expelled by compaction. It is doubtful that fluid generation and compaction operate on the same time scale at low metamorphic grade, even in rocks that are deforming by ductile mechanisms in response to tectonic stress. However, thermally-activated viscous compaction may dominate fluid flow patterns at moderate to high metamorphic grades. Compaction-driven fluid flow organizes into self-propagating domains of fluid-filled porosity that correspond to steady-state wave solutions of the governing equations. The effective rheology for compaction processes in heterogeneous rocks is dictated by the weakest lithology. Geological compaction literature invariably assumes linear viscous mechanisms; but lower crustal rocks may well be characterized by non-linear (power-law) viscous mechanisms. The steady-state solutions and scales derived here are general with respect to the dependence of the viscous rheology on effective pressure. These solutions are exploited to predict the geometry and properties of the waves as a function of rock rheology and the rate of metamorphic fluid production. In the viscous limit, wavelength is controlled by a hydrodynamic length scale $\delta$, which varies inversely with temperature, and/or the rheological length scale for thermal activation of viscous deformation l A , which is on the order of a kilometer. At high temperature, such that $\delta$ < l A , waves are spherical. With falling temperature, as $\delta$ → l A , waves flatten to sill-like structures. If the fluid overpressures associated with viscous wave propagation reach the conditions for plastic failure, then compaction induces channelized fluid flow. The channeling is caused by vertically elongated porosity waves that nucleate with characteristic spacing $\delta$. Because $\delta$ increases with falling temperature, this mechanism is amplified towards the surface. Porosity wave passage is associated with pressure anomalies that generate an oscillatory lateral component to the fluid flux that is comparable to the vertical component. As the vertical component may be orders of magnitude greater than time-averaged metamorphic fluxes, porosity waves are a potentially important agent for metasomatism. The time and spatial scales of these mechanisms depend on the initial state that is perturbed by the metamorphic process. Average fluxes place an upper limit on the spatial scale and a lower limit on the time scale, but the scales are otherwise unbounded. Thus, inversion of natural fluid flow patterns offers the greatest hope for constraining the compaction scales. Porosity waves are a self-localizing mechanism for deformation and fluid flow. In nature these mechanisms are superimposed on patterns induced by far-field stress and pre-existing heterogeneities.},

abstract = {The prediction of the location of ground water discharge areas is a key aspect for the protection and (re)development of ground water-dependent wetlands. Ground water discharge areas can be simulated with MODFLOW using the DRAIN package by setting the drain level equal to the topography, while the conductance is mostly set to an arbitrary high value. However, conceptual and practical problems arise in the calculation of the ground water discharge by the DRAIN package as calculated water tables above the land surface, difficult parameterization of the conductance, and large water balance errors. To overcome these problems, a new SEEPAGE package for MODFLOW is proposed. The basic idea of this package is an adaptable constant head cell. It has a variable head, unless the ground water rises above the seepage level, in which case it has a constant head cell. The estimation of the ground water discharge location along a homogeneous, isotropic, linear sloping profile is used to verify the model and to compare it to the DRAIN solution. In an application to three basins in Belgium, it is shown that the SEEPAGE package can be used in combination with the DRAIN package in situations where an upper boundary for a free water table and additional resistance for drainage is required. It is clearly demonstrated that the identification and delineation of regional ground water discharge areas is more accurate using the SEEPAGE package.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional finite element models of coupled sediment compaction, variable-density ground-water flow, and conductive/convective heat transfer are used in this study to quantify basin hydrodynamics during the initial and flexural stages of continental rifting. The analysis also incorporates a two-stage stretching/cooling geodynamic model of the thermomechanical evolution of the lithosphere underlying the rift in order to specify geologically relevant boundary conditions for basin subsidence and basal heat flow. A sensitivity study is made using the model to explore the controls of both permeability and water table configuration in determining the dominant fluid flow drive (compaction, density, or topography) during basin evolution. The sensitivity analysis incorporates hydrologic conditions and rock properties representative of many extensional terrains. Assuming that rift basin subsidence and basal heat flow can be represented by the geodynamic model, two distinct ground-water flow systems evolve within continental rifts during basin evolution. During the initial (stretching) phase of rifting, subsidence is accommodated by fault block motion, and a topography-driven ground-water flow system develops within the permeable alluvial-fan deposits. Within the less permeable lacustrine facies located in the center of the basin, compaction-driven ground-water flow dominates. Here, the compacting lacustrine sediments focus pore fluids laterally from the basin center into the alluvial- fan deposits due to the relatively large permeability contrast between the two depositional environments. Thermal anomalies resulting from convective heat transfer are restricted to alluvial-fan facies near the basin-framing fault. During the thermal cooling (flexural) stage of basin development, laterally extensive onlap facies are deposited, and density-driven ground-water flow dominates in the permeable alluvial-fan deposits, while compaction-driven flow continues within the lacustrine and onlap facies. The presence of a permeable aquifer within the onlap facies resulted in long-range fluid transport to the edge of the basin. During both stages of basin evolution, ground-water velocities varied from 10 (super -5) to 10 (super -1) m/yr between the lacustrine and alluvial-fan deposits, respectively. The observed presence of ore mineralization within alluvial-fan deposits of some continental-rift systems, such as the Cretaceous Rift Basin of Angola, supports the findings of this study.

abstract = {An interpretation is offered for the observation that dispersivities increase with scale. Apparent longitudinal dispersivity data from a variety of hydrogeologic settings are assumed to represent a continuous hierarchy of log hydraulic conductivity fields with mutually uncorrelated increments, each field having its own exponential autocovariance, associated integral scale, and variance that increases as a power of scale. Such a hierarchy is shown theoretically to form a self-similar random field with homogeneous increments. Regardless of whether or not the underlying assumption is valid, one can justify interpreting the apparent dispersivities in a manner consistent with a recent quasi-linear theory of non-Fickian and Fickian dispersion in homogeneous media which supports the notion of a self-similar where c is a constant, a fractal hierarchy a posteriori. and The hierarchy dimension D -• E + 0.75, is revealed to possess where E is the a semivariogram topological interest. This can be viewed as a universal scaling rule about which large deviations occur due to local influences including the existence of discrete natural scales at which log hydraulic conductivity is statistically homogeneous. As such homogeneity is at best a local phenomenon occurring intermit- tently over narrow bands of the scale spectrum, one must question the utility of associating medium properties with representative elementary volumes and relying on Fickian models of dispersion over more than relatively narrow scale intervals. Porous and fractured media appear to follow the same idealized scaling rule for both flow and transport, raising a question about the validity of many distinctions commonly drawn between such media. Finally, the data suggest that conditioning transport models through calibration against hydraulic measurements has the effect of filtering out large-scale modes from the hierarchy.},

Ever since the emergence, thirty fluvial terraces of the lower Maas river have been formed due to regional uplift. Their age-altitude record shows strong evidence for an important acceleration of the tectonic activity at the end of the Pliocene (around 3 Ma), and for high-frequency oscillations superimposed on a general continuous trend. Three relaxation periods during the Quaternary were identified, the first from 1.5 to 1.2 Ma and two short ones around 5 ka BP and after 2 ka BP, respectively. The reactivations, following these relaxation periods, appear to be of plate-tectonic importance. The observed accelerations in tectonic activity since the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene to the present day, raise the question: are we at present living in a period of extremely high crustal dynamics? Floodplain positions of the rivers Rhine and Maas repeatedly changed in space and time. Strike-slip movements along the graben bounding faults explain this behaviour. The events point to punctuated changes in the stress field orientation, probably related to the interplay between Alpine and Ardennes-Rhenish Shield stress generators within the regional stress field.},

abstract = {The concentration of mass during regional metamorphism and metallogenesis requires interactions between regional and local hydrothermal systems that are scale- and time-dependent. During regional low- to medium-temperature metamorphism in which fluid flow is driven by broad thermal or mechanical gradients, fluid flow rates are (on average) \textless10-8 m/s, and are limited by restricted permeabilities and gentle gradients in hydraulic head. In contrast, coseismic fluid flow rates in major fault zones may reach ≥10-2 m/s. As a consequence, there may be a limited capacity for individual faults to substantially control fluid flow in the region because of the large contrast in flow rates and permeabilities between faults and low permeability rocks. To produce a major epigenetic ore deposit in overpressured crust, fluid flow systems with such diverse flow rates must interact in such a way that metal dissolution and transport from regional fluid flow systems culminate in focused fluid flow with metal deposition. This is best achieved through two steps; one in which km-scale hydrothermal systems channel into 100 m-scale ductile shear zones largely by reaction- and deformation-enhanced permeability in the shear zone; and a second one in which rapid fluid pressure changes accompanying brittle faulting (or intense shearing) within the broader shear zones causes metal deposition and ore genesis.},

abstract = {Models of groundwater flow and solute transport may be affected by numerical error, leading to quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior. In this paper we compare and combine three methods of assessing the extent of numerical error: grid refinement, mathematical analysis, and benchmark test problems. In particular, we assess the popular solute transport code SUTRA [ Voss, 1984] as being a typical finite element code. Our numerical analysis suggests that SUTRA incorporates a numerical dispersion error and that its mass-lumped numerical scheme increases the numerical error. This is confirmed using a Gaussian test problem. A modified SUTRA code, in which the numerical dispersion is calculated and subtracted, produces better results. The much more challenging Elder problem [ Elder, 1967;  Voss and Souza, 1987] is then considered. Calculation of its numerical dispersion coefficients and numerical stability show that the Elder problem is prone to error. We confirm that Elder problem results are extremely sensitive to the simulation method used.},

abstract = {The semi-empirical Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation is the most famous permeability-porosity relation, which is widely used in the field of flow in porous media and is the starting point for many other permeability models. However, this relation has many limitations from its inception, and the KC constant is an empirical parameter which was proved to be not a constant. In this paper, we briefly reviewed the KC equation, its modifications and various models for the KC constant. We then derived an analytical expression for the permeability in homogeneous porous media based on the fractal characters of porous media and capillary model. The proposed model is expressed as a function of fractal dimensions, porosity and maximum pore size. The analytical KC constant with no empirical constant is obtained from the assumption of square geometrical model. Furthermore, a distinct linear scaling law between the dimensionless permeability and porosity is found. It is also shown that our analytical permeability is more closely related to the microstructures (fractal dimensions, porosity and maximum pore size), compared to those obtained from conventional methods and models. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The evolution of the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) and the Alpine orogen is discussed on the base of a set of palaeotectonic maps and two retro-deformed lithospheric transects which extend across the Western and Central Alps and the Massif Central and the Rhenish Massif, respectively. During the Paleocene, compressional stresses exerted on continental Europe by the evolving Alps and Pyrenees caused lithospheric buckling and basin inversion up to 1700 km to the north of the Alpine and Pyrenean deformation fronts. This deformation was accompanied by the injection of melilite dykes, reflecting a plume-related increase in the temperature of the asthenosphere beneath the European foreland. At the Paleocene-Eocene transition, compressional stresses relaxed in the Alpine foreland, whereas collisional interaction of the Pyrenees with their foreland persisted. In the Alps, major Eocene north-directed lithospheric shortening was followed by mid-Eocene slab- and thrust-loaded subsidence of the Dauphinois and Helvetic shelves. During the late Eocene, north-directed compressional intraplate stresses originating in the Alpine and Pyrenean collision zones built up and activated ECRIS. At the Eocene-Oligocene transition, the subducted Central Alpine slab was detached, whereas the West-Alpine slab remained attached to the lithosphere. Subsequently, the Alpine orogenic wedge converged northwestward with its foreland. The Oligocene main rifting phase of ECRIS was controlled by north-directed compressional stresses originating in the Pyrenean and Alpine collision zones. Following early Miocene termination of crustal shortening in the Pyrenees and opening of the oceanic Proven{\c{c}}al Basin, the evolution of ECRIS was exclusively controlled by west- and northwest-directed compressional stresses emanating from the Alps during imbrication of their external massifs. Whereas the grabens of the Massif Central and the Rh{\^{o}}ne Valley became inactive during the early Miocene, the Rhine Rift System remained active until the present. Lithospheric folding controlled mid-Miocene and Pliocene uplift of the Vosges-Black Forest Arch. Progressive uplift of the Rhenish Massif and Massif Central is mainly attributed to plume-related thermal thinning of the mantle-lithosphere. ECRIS evolved by passive rifting in response to the build-up of Pyrenean and Alpine collision-related compressional intraplate stresses. Mantle-plume-type upwelling of the asthenosphere caused thermal weakening of the foreland lithosphere, rendering it prone to deformation.},

Biotite and K-feldspar 40Ar-39Ar, and zircon and apatite fission-track ages from metamorphic core complexes in the corridor consistently young in the displacement directions of detachment faults. The onset of rapid extension is denoted by an abrupt change, at c. 22–21 Ma, in cooling rate derived from age-closure temperature plots, and in slope of age-distance gradients in footwalls. Linear age-distance trends with slopes of c. 3–8 km Ma−1, for low-temperature thermochronometers, give time-averaged displacement rates on detachment faults. Gradients of mineral age across thick tilted hanging wall fault blocks reveal palaeotemperature gradients when the angle of tilting is known. Pre-extensional thermal gradients for tilted blocks in the southern Basin and Range province were c. 20–25°C km−1, 17° ± 5°C km−1, and c. 20–24°C km−1. Thermochronological data from the footwall of the Chemehuevi detachment fault reveal a trend of increasing temperature, in the known slip direction, from ≤200° to 350–400°C over an exposed distance of 23 km, at the onset of extension. The gradual increase in temperature constrains the Chemehuevi detachment fault to have had an original dip of c. 15–30°, within the brittle upper crust. },

Thermal history and crustal architecture in the study areas were affected mainly by the Variscan Orogeny during late Palaeozoic times. Calibration of the simulated thermal histories is primarily based on vitrinite reflectance and fission-track data. Mechanical modelling reveals average {beta} values of 1.7, reaching a maximum of 2.4 in the central basin (Mosel Graben) and at the transition to the Giessen Ocean to the south during Early Devonian rifting. This stage was associated with tholeitic magmatism and an elevated heat flow of up to 110 mW m-2, preserved in weakly overprinted syn-rift sediments. Average basal heat flow during maximum burial at the end of the Carboniferous period (i.e. the end of crustal shortening) was between 50 and 70 mW m-2 with a slight decrease from the Subvarian foreland basins towards the Rheno-Hercynian in the south. The values suggest average crustal thicknesses of between 32 and 36 km during late Carboniferous time. For the Saar-Nahe Basin, values between 50 and 75 mW/m2 represent the thermal regime in the upper crust during the late Stephanian and early Permian time. Estimated eroded thicknesses of Palaeozoic sediments vary between 2500 m in the northern and central Ruhr Basin and more than 6000 m in the Osteifel and the Siegen Anticline within the Rheno-Hercynian, and between 1800 and 3600 m in the Saar-Nahe Basin. Fission-track data provide evidence for significant reheating during the Mesozoic era within the entire study area. This phase of heating, probably linked to North Atlantic rifting, coincides with post-Variscan ore formation and with major tectono-magmatic events in central Europe.},

abstract = {We performed a detailed analysis of the thermal state of the Cenozoic Roer Valley Graben, the north2013western branch of the European Cenozoic Rift System, based on a new set of temperature data. We developed a numerical technique for correcting bottom hole temperatures, including an evaluation of the uncertainty of thermal parameters. Comparison with drill stem test temperatures indicated that the uncertainty in corrected bottom hole temperatures using a two-component numerical model is approximately � 4��C, which is much more accurate than the up to 15��C errors encountered in often-used line-source or Horner correction methods. The subsurface temperatures and the derived regional heat flow estimates of 53 � 6 to 63 � 6�mW�m22122 show no significant difference between the central rift and the adjacent structural highs. The absence of an elevated heat flow is attributed to the low amount of lithospheric thinning during the Cenozoic rifting phase (03B2=1.0620131.15). A local thermal anomaly exceeding +10��C was found in five wells in the north2013western part of the rift basin at depths of 100020131500�m, and is most likely caused by the upward flow of fluids along faults, whereas lower temperatures in the upper 1500�m in the southern part of the rift basin could indicate cooling by topography-driven groundwater flow. Conflicting ideas exist on the active or passive rifting mechanisms responsible for the formation of the different rift basins of European Cenozoic Rift System. The low spatial variation in heat flow found in this study suggests that the mechanism responsible for forming the Roer Valley Graben is passive rifting.},

abstract = {In the area of the Cenozoic Rhine rift system, crustal and lithospheric thicknesses range between 24 and 35 km, and 60 and 120 km, respectively. This rift system transects the deeply truncated Variscan Orogen and superimposed Permo-Carboniferous wrench-induced troughs, and Late Permian and Mesozoic thermal sag basins. At the time of its Westphalian consolidation, the Variscan Orogen was probably characterized by 45-60 km deep-crustal roots that were associated with its Rheno-Hercynian-Saxo-Thuringian, Saxo-Thuringian-Bohemian and Bohemian-Moldanubian sutures, all of which are transected by the Cenozoic Rhine rift system. During the Stephanian-Early Permian wrench-induced disruption of the Variscan Orogen, subducted lithospheric slabs were detached causing upwelling of hot mantle material. During the resulting thermal surge, partial delamination and/or thermal thinning of the continental mantle-lithosphere induced regional uplift. At the same time the Variscan orogenic roots were destroyed and crustal thicknesses reduced to 28-35 km in response to the combined effects of mantle-derived melts interacting with the lower crust, regional erosional unroofing of the crust and, on a more local scale, by its mechanical stretching. Towards the end of the Early Permian, the potential temperature of the asthenosphere returned to ambient levels. With this, regional, long-term thermal subsidence of the lithosphere commenced, controlling the development of a new system of Late Permian and Mesozoic thermal sag basins. However, the evolution of these basins was repeatedly overprinted by minor short-term subsidence accelerations that reflect the build-up of far-field stresses related to rifting in the Tethyan and Atlantic domains. Comparison of observed and modelled subsidence curves suggests that in the area of the Rhine rift system the lithosphere had equilibrated with the asthenosphere at the end of the Cretaceous at depths of 100-120 km, before it became thermally destabilized again by Cenozoic rifting and plume-related magmatism. Modelled subsidence curves indicate that by the end of Early Permian times the thermal thickness of the remnant mantle-lithosphere ranged between 10 and 50 km in areas that were later incorporated into Mesozoic thermal sag basins; this corresponds to mid-Permian thermal lithosphere thicknesses of 40-80 km.},

abstract = {Field-based geological studies show that continental deformation preferentially occurs in young tectonic provinces rather than in old cratons1. This partitioning of deformation suggests that the cratons are stronger than surrounding younger Phanerozoic provinces. However, although Archaean and Phanerozoic lithosphere differ in their thickness2, 3, 4 and composition4, 5, their relative strength is a matter of much debate. One proxy of strength is the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te. Unfortunately, spatial variations in Te are not well understood, as different methods yield different results. The differences are most apparent in cratons, where the 'Bouguer coherence' method yields large Te values (\textgreater 60 km)6, 7, 8, 9 whereas the 'free-air admittance' method yields low values (\textless 25 km)10. Here we present estimates of the variability of Te in Europe using both methods. We show that when they are consistently formulated11, both methods yield comparable Te values that correlate with geology, and that the strength of old lithosphere ( 1.5 Gyr old) is much larger (mean Te \textgreater 60 km) than that of younger lithosphere (mean Te \textless 30 km). We propose that this strength difference reflects changes in lithospheric plate structure (thickness, geothermal gradient and composition) that result from mantle temperature and volatile content decrease through Earth's history.},

abstract = {At convergent margins the drcollement zone comprises the plate boundary and is marked by profound structural disharmony, by changes in stress orientation and by a discontinuity in plate velocity. The d$\sim$collement zone initiates in a weak sediment layer, typically a low-permeability hemipelagic mud lying below a more rapidly deposited, stronger, more permeable trench turbidite sequence. At the deformation front, trench turbidites tend to be offscraped, whereas the finer-grained hemipelagic and pelagic sediments are more likely to be underthrust. Offscraped materials may undergo only limited burial whereas underthrust deposits can be deeply buried, undergo high-pressure metamorphism, and are more likely to be preserved in the stratigraphic record. Burial rates associated with underthrusting are high, exceeding 20 kin/my. With high rates of underthrusting, sediment descending below the drcollement zone is probably buried faster than it can dewater, resulting in emplacement of relatively high porosity deposits at depth. Fluids flowing from modern drcollement zones have migrated substantial distances laterally and tapped deep sources. The episodicity of flow suggests pumping of fluid by cycles of dilation and flow to the drcollement zone followed by failure and fluid expansion along the drcollement zone. Possible pressure gradients below the drcollement zone allow flow upward into it while maintaining minimum effective stress along it. The thickness of sediment underthrust beneath the drcollement zone determines whether these deposits are emplaced by diffusive underplating with stratal disruption and efficient dewatering, or by coherent underplating with the formation of macroscopic duplexes and transfer of fluid to the base of the accretionary prism. Deformation mechanisms affecting aecreted sediment depend on depth of entrainment into the drcollement zone and duration of residence.},

abstract = {Measurement of homogenization temperatures for 274 aqueous and 366 hydrocarbon fluid inclusions trapped within quartz overgrowths in Jurassic sandstones from the Norwegian continental shelf indicates that quartz cementation of the studied sandstones has taken place at temperatures between 75 degrees C and 165 degrees C. Inclusions trapped at temperatures below 100 degrees C are common in samples that have spent several tens of millions of years within the temperature interval 75-100 degrees C, whereas sandstones that have passed more rapidly through this range of temperatures seldom contain inclusions trapped below 100 degrees C, probably due to inclusions not having had time to form in the sandstones that were heated most rapidly. Different heating rates after sandstones enter the temperature range where quartz cementation takes place may also give rise to a correlation between homogenization temperatures and present formation temperatures, since inclusions of a given size that start to form simultaneously in different sandstones become closed at the highest temperatures in the sandstones that are heated most rapidly. Such a correlation may be misinterpreted as indicating stretching of inclusions and resetting of homogenization temperatures. Quartz cementation at temperatures above 75 degrees C is compatible with dissolution of quartz clasts at stylolites and grain contacts and/or quartz produced by clay-mineral reactions in shales being the dominant sources of quartz cement. However, lack of a viable mechanism for transport of large amounts of quartz from shales and into sandstones, combined with the common occurrence of stylolites in the studied cores, suggests that dissolution of quartz at stylolites, and to a lesser extent at grain contacts, were the most important sources of quartz cement. Homogenization temperatures approximately equal to or slightly below present formation temperature are common in the studied sandstones despite the presence of hydrocarbons. This suggests that quartz cementation is still in progress, which in turn implies that hydrocarbon emplacement has not stopped quartz cementation. Probable continued quartz cementation after hydrocarbon emplacement can be explained by dissolution of quartz at stylolites and grain contacts and subsequent short-range diffusion to sites of precipitation through water films coating grains.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal flow at oceanic spreading centres accounts for about ten per cent of all heat flux in the oceans and controls the thermal structure of young oceanic plates. It also influences ocean and crustal chemistry, provides a basis for chemosynthetic ecosystems, and has formed massive sulphide ore deposits throughout Earth's history. Despite this, how and under what conditions heat is extracted, in particular from the lower crust, remains largely unclear. Here we present high-resolution, whole-crust, two- and three-dimensional simulations of hydrothermal flow beneath fast-spreading ridges that predict the existence of two interacting flow components, controlled by different physical mechanisms, that merge above the melt lens to feed ridge-centred vent sites. Shallow on-axis flow structures develop owing to the thermodynamic properties of water, whereas deeper off-axis flow is strongly shaped by crustal permeability, particularly the brittle-ductile transition. About 60 per cent of the discharging fluid mass is replenished on-axis by warm (up to 300 degrees Celsius) recharge flow surrounding the hot thermal plumes, and the remaining 40 per cent or so occurs as colder and broader recharge up to several kilometres away from the axis that feeds hot (500-700 degrees Celsius) deep-rooted off-axis flow towards the ridge. Despite its lower contribution to the total mass flux, this deep off-axis flow carries about 70 per cent of the thermal energy released at the ridge axis. This combination of two flow components explains the seismically determined thermal structure of the crust and reconciles previously incompatible models favouring either shallower on-axis or deeper off-axis hydrothermal circulation.},

abstract = {In the southern Rio Grande rift, two extensional regimes of different origin (but transitional with each other through the Miocene) can be interpreted from structures and rocks formed within the past 28 to 29 m.y. The earlier regime, which began about 28 to 29 m.y. B.P., is characterized by emplacement of “basaltic andesite” flows with relatively high strontium isotope ratios; formation of broad, relatively deep, northwest-trending basins; and incipient uplift of some of the region's fault-block mountains. This regime appears to have developed in a back-arc setting, perhaps behind a rapidly steepening slab and a westward-sweeping arc system.
The younger episode seemingly represents a renewal or acceleration of block faulting and volcanism during the latest Miocene and Pliocene, 9 to 3 m.y. B.P., after a long transitional period during the early and mid-Miocene when volcanism was absent and tectonism was less vigorous. The latest Miocene-Pliocene episode produced the modern northerly-trending rift basins and uplifts, regional uplift of the rift 1 to 2 km above sea level, and renewal of volcanism, this time dominated by relatively primitive alkali-olivine basalt. New basalt dates reveal that in the southern rift, modern ranges and basins were almost fully developed and that near-modern drainage ways were established across uplifts into bolsons by about 5.0 m.y. B.P. An ancestral Rio Grande had extended itself southward into the southern rift by 3 to 4 m.y. B.P., and the river entrenched itself into its modern valley between 0.7 and 0.5 m.y. B.P.
Horst-graben development of the southern Basin and Range province, as well as associated basaltic volcanism, swept progressively eastward from southeastern California in the past 20 m.y., culminating in formation of the Rio Grande rift and other fault-block terrane in west Texas, New Mexico, and northern Chihuahua in the latest Miocene and Pliocene. Late Quaternary Basin and Range fault scarps increase in density eastward, which also suggests that more easterly parts of the province are youngest. These relationships support a previous model of an eastward-expanding, slab-free triangle (related to growth of the San Andreas transform), through which mantle upwelling triggers eastward-younging patterns of tectonism, volcanism, and uplift and promotes lithospheric thinning and increased heat flow. Across most of the southern Basin and Range and Rio Grande rift, the horst-graben structures related to growth of this triangle are superimposed on somewhat older (late Oligocene-middle Miocene) extensional terrane that appears to have formed in a back-arc or arc setting.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We present a new approach, based on neural networks, to predict the thermal conductivity of sedimentary rocks from a set of geophysical well logs. This method is calibrated on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) data, which provide several thousands of conductivity measurements combined with five geophysical well logs (sonic, density, neutron porosity, resistivity and gamma ray). This data set is used to train multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and to find an empirical relationship between well logs (MLP inputs) and thermal conductivity (MLP output). Validation tests suggest that MLP provide better estimates of thermal conductivity (within 15 per cent confidence level) than classical linear models, and still give satisfying results with sets of only four well logs if neutron porosity is included. In two ODP sites (863B and 1109D), MLP's predictions are compared to conventional 'mixing' methods. Although this latter technique gives reliable results provided that rocks description is precise enough, the MLP is more straightforward, does not need any extra parameter and makes predictions in good agreement with the experimental trends. This method will be useful in the estimation of heat flow from data acquired in scientific and industrial boreholes.},

abstract = {It was suggested that brine of the Dead Sea rift has originated from a residual product of intensively evaporated seawater that invaded the rift, precipitated halite, and later interacted through dolomitization with the host rock during subsurface migration. Detection of this brine in many deep wells located at distances as far as 100 km away from the rift was attributed to long-distance migration of the brine. The physical feasibility of such migration, which probably spanned the past 3-6 m.y., is quantitatively tested and verified in this study by using paleohydrologic modeling. The structural formation of the rift is described by a chronological sequence of geologic cross sections serving as the basis for hydrodynamic calculations, which assess the effects of the structure on fluid migration, salinity redistribution, and heat transport across the sedimentary basin. Results indicate that two basin-scale ground-water systems, one atop the other but with opposite flow directions, coexisted in the Dead Sea rift valley. The first is a topography-driven flow of meteoric water from the surrounding highlands toward the rift through relatively shallow aquifers (≤ 1 km). The second is a density-driven migration of the Dead Sea brine through deep aquifers (4-5 km) in the opposite direction. The configuration of these flow systems has changed during the structural evolution of the Dead Sea rift, illustrating the interrelationships among basin formation, paleohydrology, and paleogeochemistry.},

The inversion characteristics are compared with those of other basins in the region, to provide constraints on the Palaeogene compressional tectonic movements in NW Europe. The inversion of the West Netherlands Basin, which is characterized by the doming of the basin centre and by the reactivation of pre-existing faults in a reverse mode, was found to be the result of a continuous inversion process rather than a distinct tectonic pulse. The intensity of the tectonic movements was not uniform throughout the Eocene and was strongest during the Latest Eocene. These characteristics are similar to those of other basins in the southern North Sea region and in the English Channel area. In addition, a good correlation exists between Alpine tectonic events and the Palaeogene inversion phases. In light of these observations the Latest Eocene inversion pulse in the southern North Sea region can be considered as the culmination of a long-term inversion process that originated from the Alpine collision.},

However, evidence shows that they have undergone considerable processing. Elucidating the complex formation history of aqueously altered chondrite groups has been a principal objective of cosmochemistry. Fulfilling this objective requires understanding the nature of the water-rock interactions involved. Many current alteration models are generally founded upon an assumption of uniform alteration in a closed system. In these models, different chondrite groups must originate on separate parent bodies. Contrary to this common view, we show that chondrite data are consistent with non-uniform alteration in a convecting system so that multiple chondrite groups can form within a single body. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@inproceedings{Wilson2006,
abstract = {Anorogenic intra-plate magmatism was widespread in Europe from early Tertiary to Recent times, extending west to east from Spain to Bulgaria, and south to north from Sicily to northern Germany. Magmatism is spatially and temporally associated with Alpine-Pyrenean collisional tectonics, the development of an extensive lithospheric rift system in the northern foreland of the Alps, and, locally, with uplift of Variscan basement massifs (Massif Central, Rhenish Massif, Bohemian Massif). The volcanic regions vary in volume from large central volcanoes (e.g. Cantal, Massif Central;Vogelsberg, northern Germany), to small isolated plugs (e.g. Urach and Hegau provinces in southern Germany). Within the Mediterranean region, the Dinarides, the Pannonian Basin and Bulgaria, anorogenic volcanism locally post-dates an earlier phase of subduction-related magmatism. The major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope characteristics of the most primitive mafic magmatic rocks (MgO > 6 wt %) provide important constraints on the nature of the mantle source and the conditions of partial melting.. These are predominantly sodic (melilitites, nephelinites, basanites and alkali olivine basalts); however, locally, potassic magma types (olivine leucitites, leucite nephelinites) also occur. In several localities (e.g., Sicily; Vogelsberg and the Rhine Graben, Germany; Calatrava, central Spain) olivine- and quartz-tholeiites form a significant component of the magmatism. The sodic magmas were derived by variable degrees of partial melting ($\sim$ 0.5 - 5 %) within a transitional zone between garnet-peridotite and spinel-peridotite mantle facies, close to the base of the lithosphere; the potassic magma types are interpreted as partial melts of enriched domains within the lithospheric mantle. Mantle partial melting was induced by adiabatic decompression of the asthenosphere, locally in small-scale, plume-like, diapirs which appear to upwell from $\sim$ 400 km depth.},

This paper reviews research on beach groundwater dynamics and identifies research questions which will need to be answered before swash zone sediment transport can be successfully modelled. After defining the principal terms relating to beach groundwater, the behavior, measurement and modelling of beach groundwater dynamics is described. Research questions related to the mechanisms of surface–subsurface flow interaction are reviewed, particularly infiltration, exfiltration and fluidisation.

abstract = {The Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) is located in the southern part of the Netherlands and adjacent parts of Gemany and Belgium. The last rifting episode of the RVRS started in the Late Oligocene and is still ongoing. The present-day seismic activity in the rift system is part of that last rifting episode. In this paper, the Quaternary tectonics of the RVRS are studied using the detailed stratigraphic record. Subsidence analyses show that three periods of subsidence can be discriminated during the Quaternary. A phase of rapid subsidence took place from the beginning of the Quaternary to the Upper Tiglian ( 1800 ka). This was followed by a phase of slow subsidence lasting until the Late Quaternary ( 500 ka). An acceleration in subsidence at the end of the Quaternary occurred in the central and northern parts of the RVRS (i.e. the Roer Valley Graben and the Peel Horst) during the last 500 ka. During the Quaternary, the most active fault zones in the RVRS are the Peel Boundary Fault zone and the Feldbiss Fault zone. Average displacements along these fault zones vary between 5 and 80 mm/ka. Periods of high and low displacement rates along faults can be discriminated. The magnitude of the subsidence rate in the central part of the RVRS, which in theory is caused by a combination of processes like faulting, cooling of the lithosphere and isostasy, is within the range of the rate of displacement along the major fault zones of the RVRS, which implies that the subsidence of the RVRS is to a large extent controlled by faulting. Along the wide and staggered Feldbiss Fault zone, the location of the largest displacement rate shifts during the Quaternary, whereas the Peel Boundary Fault zone, which is narrow and has a straight structure, is more stable in this respect. The present-day fault displacement rates inferred by geodetic measurements are two orders of magnitude larger than the rates inferred from the geological record. Such a large difference can be explained by a high variability of fault movements on a short time-scale due to fault-stress interactions. The stratigraphic record has preserved average displacement rates. Flexural analyses shows that the pattern of geodetically determined displacements is in accordance with the fault spacing in the fault zone. The NW-SE directed fault system active during the Quaternary and the Tertiary is inherited from the late stage of the Variscan orogeny. This fault system was also dominantly active during the Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic evolution of the RVRS. Lineament analysis of the topography indicates that apart from the dominant NW-SE-oriented faults, N-S and NE-SW directed faults are also prominent. These faults originate from the Caledonian tectonic phases. They have, however, no large displacements during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The fact that Paleozoic fault systems are reactivated during Quaternary and Tertiary indicates that these faults are fundamental weakness zones.},

Six Six methane target areas contain a producible enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM), volume of 53-79 x 109m3. This provides a minimum CO2 sequestration potential of 400 x 106 tons. ECBM development factors include the sedimentological setting of the coal sequence as well as changes in porosity, permeability and stress conditions induced by former mining activities.

During fluid ascent and cooling, the pH of the brine shifted towards more acidic (around 4) and the oxidation state increased to conditions above the hematite-magnetite buffer. These chemical characteristics contrast strongly with those of the pore and fracture fluid residing in the limestone aquifer, which had a pH between 8 and 9 in equilibrium with calcite and was rather reduced due to the presence of organic matter in the limestone.

The mechanism of fluid mixing also seems to be responsible for the formation of other MVT deposits in Europe (e.g., R{\'{e}}ocin, Northern Spain; Tr{\`{e}}ves, Southern France; and Cracow-Silesia, Poland), which show notable similarities in terms of their age, mineralogy. and mineral chemistry to the MVT deposit near Wiesloch.},

abstract = {Total groundwater discharge from a sandy seepage site to the Delaware Bay at Cape Henlopen, Delaware, was determined together with the associated nutrient loads by trapping the discharge from a length of the shoreline in a tidal pond at low tide and measuring the discharge of the trapped water through a weir at steady state. Salinity was used to parse the total groundwater discharge from the beachface at low tide into a "recycled" estuarine component and a "new" fresh groundwater component. Based on 16 measurements over 18 months, average total discharge and average freshwater discharge at low tide were found to be 2.76 +/- 1.08 and 0.87 +/- 0.43 L min(-1) m(-1) of shoreline, respectively. The estuarine component of discharge varied with the maximum height of the immediately preceding high tide. Owing to the control of freshwater discharge by the average upland hydraulic gradient away from the beach, individual measurements of freshwater discharge at low tide represent a good estimate of this discharge component over time scales of hours to days. Based on the nutrient concentrations in the discharge waters, nutrient loads from the beach to the adjacent estuary at low tide were 148 +/- 79, 7.5 +/- 5.1, and 197 +/- 101 mu mol min(-1) m(-1) of shoreline for total dissolved N, P, and Si, respectively. Groundwater discharge and these nutrient fluxes contribute significantly to the unusually productive benthic communities that inhabit the seepage and nearby intertidal zones.},

abstract = {Sedimentary basin inversion, the shortening of formerly extensional basins, is accommodated mainly by compressional reactivation of extant faults and fractures across a wide range of scales. As such, inversion is a large-scale manifestation of Byerlee friction, the dynamic criterion for fault reactivation governing the effective shear strength of the shallow crust. Basin inversion generates distinctive deformational architecture, and it is implicated strongly in sedimentary basin exhumation. As a principal source of horizontal stress, inversion drives significant sedimentary porosity reduction and resultant fluid flow. Upper crustal deformation is critically dependent on fluid overpressure (i.e., pore fluid pressures greater than would be calculated from a hydrostatic gradient), and, perhaps more than in any other tectonic setting, overpressures are potentially large during sedimentary basin inversion. This review therefore includes discussion of the role of fluid overpressure in inversion and the evidence for it. Collectively, inversion has profound implications–good and bad–for the prospectivity of many petroliferous sedimentary basins. Thus, recognizing the evidence for basin inversion, quantifying its magnitude and understanding the mechanisms that accommodate inversion and other phenomena affected by it, have become essential components of the basin analyst's remit.},

In contrast, the subsidiary ESE-dipping thrusts appear optimally oriented in the stress field. The combined reactivation of existing, unfavourably oriented reverse faults and optimally oriented thrusts requires high but probably variable fluid-overpressuring within the rock-mass. Evidence for overpressures in and around the seismogenic fault system comes from borehole measurements in the hanging-wall sedimentary basin plus a range of anomalous seismological and electrical characteristics which also suggest an overpressured mid-crust below the seismogenic zone. Minor postseismic effusion of anomalously warm, saline formation fluids was recorded from the aftershock area: similar discharges characterize the epicentral areas of historic earthquakes in the Niigata region. The rupturing of unfavourably oriented faults in a fluid-overpressured compressional regime – together with the swarm-like character of the aftershock activity and the evidence of postseismic discharge – are all suggestive of a ‘fault-valve' episode involving upwards migration of fluids from compartmentalized fluid-overpressures within the seismogenic zone.},

abstract = {We have developed a diode laser (25 W, 808 nm) system for He extraction from minerals for (U-Th)/He chronometry. The laser beam is delivered via a 600 $\mu$m fiber cable and focused using a binocular microscope. Temperatures necessary for He release from apatite (500–600�C) and zircon (1100–1300�C) encapsulated in Pt-foil tubes are attained by heating to 0.5 W for 30 s and 1.25–2.5 W for 20 min, respectively, using a defocused beam. Heating at these powers does not result in measurable U and/or Th loss from apatite, as noted by the preservation of the distinct Th/U in multiple splits of two different Durango apatite crystals. Analyses of Durango and the California Institute of Technology internal standard apatite 97MR22 yield (U-Th)/He ages of 32.8 � 1.8 Ma (1$\sigma$, n = 11) and 4.6 � 0.5 (1$\sigma$, n = 5), respectively, well within accepted ages. The (U-Th)/He age and Th/U of five Fish Canyon Tuff zircon aliquots yield 29.3 � 2.2 Ma (1$\sigma$) and 0.6 � 0.03, respectively, and are indistinguishable from ages produced by resistance furnace He extraction. Heating of unencapsulated minerals shows that the diode laser couples well with optically opaque minerals (e.g., hornblende, biotite, muscovite, garnet) and basalt groundmass, suggesting that diode lasers offer a cheap, small, low-maintenance alternative to Nd:YAG and Ar ion lasers for 40Ar/39Ar, cosmogenic noble gas, and stable isotope studies.},

abstract = {Abstract The Seferihisar–Bal{\c{c}}ova Geothermal system (SBG) is characterized by complex temperature and hydrochemical anomalies. Previous geophysical and hydrochemical investigations suggest that hydrothermal convection in the faulted areas of the SBG and recharge flow from the Horst may be responsible for the observed patterns. A numerical model of coupled fluid flow and heat transport processes has been built in order to study the possible fluid dynamics of deep geothermal groundwater flow in the SBG. The results support the hypothesis derived from interpreted data. The simulated scenarios provide a better understanding of the geophysical conditions under which the different fluid dynamics develop. When recharge processes are weak, the convective patterns in the faults can expand to surrounding reservoir units or below the seafloor. These fault-induced drag forces can cause natural seawater intrusion. In the Melange of the Seferihisar Horst, the regional flow is modified by buoyant-driven flow focused in the series of vertical faults. As a result, the main groundwater divide can shift. Sealing caprocks prevent fault-induced cells from being overwhelmed by vigorous regional flow. In this case, over-pressured, blind geothermal reservoirs form below the caprocks. Transient results showed that the front of rising hot waters in faults is unstable: the tip of the hydrothermal plumes can split and lead to periodical temperature oscillations. This phenomenon known as Taylor–Saffman fingering has been described in mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. Our findings suggest that this type of thermal pulsing can also develop in active, faulted geothermal systems. To some extent, the role of an impervious fault core on the flow patterns has been investigated. Although it is not possible to reproduce basin-scale transport processes, this first attempt to model deep groundwater geothermal flow in the SBG qualitatively supported the interpreted data and described the different fluid dynamics of the basin.Geofluids (2010) 10, 388–405},

abstract = {Both boreholes of the German Continental Deep Drilling Program encountered a fluid-conducting crust over a 9101 m vertical profile. Low matrix permeability was observed on the laboratory scale (geometric mean value 7×10−20 m2 with something more than one decade standard deviation) and in situ higher values of the order of 5×10−18 to 3×10−16 m2. With respect to the scatter of measured matrix permeability there was no lithology dependence observed, whereas permeability parallel to the foliation (geometric mean value 3×10−19 m2) is significant higher than those perpendicular to the foliation (2×10−20 m2). With increasing depth the in situ permeability varies within a few orders of magnitude, showing, however, no clear depth dependence. The in situ permeability increases over 3 orders of magnitude while the effective pressure decreases by 50 MPa, whereas in contrast, the permeability of laboratory core specimens changes by 1 order of magnitude. The pilot drill hole “Vorboh-rung” and the main drill hole “Hauptbohrung” communicate through a network of conductive fractures at the bottom hole level of the Vorbohrung as well as between both bottom hole sections. The formation pressure increases with a mean gradient of 11.5 Mpa km−1 from surface to 103±3 MPa to 9101 m depth. Overhydrostatic increasing pore pressure and so a strong stress reduction can be excluded as a reason for the low permeability decrease observed at the bottom of the hole. Formation pressure remains hydrostatic with respect to probable increasing salinity.},

abstract = {The 2248 40 000 km2 Hungarian Great Plain portion of the Pannonian Basin consists of a basin fill of 100 m to more than 7000 m thick semi- to unconsolidated marine, deltaic, lacustrine and fluviatile clastic sediments of Neogene age, resting on a strongly tectonized Pre-Neogene basement of horst-and-graben topography of a relief in excess of 5000 m. The basement is built of a great variety of brittle rocks, including flysch, carbonates and metamorphics. The relatively continuous Endr0151d Aquitard, with a permeability of less than 1 md (10221215 m2) and a depth varying between 500 and 5000 m, divides the basin's rock framework into upper and lower sequences of highly permeable rock units, whose permeabilities range from a few tens to several thousands of millidarcy. Subsurface fluid potential and flow fields were inferred from 16 192 water level and pore pressure measurements using three methods of representation: pressure2013elevation profiles; hydraulic head maps; and hydraulic cross-sections. Pressure2013elevation profiles were constructed for eight areas. Typically, they start from the surface with a straight-line segment of a hydrostatic gradient (03B3st = 9.8067 MPa km22121) and extend to depths of 140020132500 m. At high surface elevations, the gradient is slightly smaller than hydrostatic, while at low elevations it is slightly greater. At greater depths, both the pressures and their vertical gradients are uniformly superhydrostatic. The transition to the overpressured depths may be gradual, with a gradient of 03B3dyn = 10201315 MPa km22121 over a vertical distance of 40020131000 m, or abrupt, with a pressure jump of up to 10 MPa km22121 over less than 100 m and a gradient of 03B3dyn > 20 MPa km22121. According to the hydraulic head maps for 13 1002013500 m thick horizontal slices of the rock framework, the fluid potential in the near-surface domains declines with depth beneath positive topographic features, but it increases beneath depressions. The approximate boundary between these hydraulically contrasting regions is the 100 m elevation contour line in the Duna2013Tisza interfluve, and the 1002013110 m contours in the Ny{\'{i}}rs{\'{e}}g uplands. Below depths of 2248 600 m, islets of superhydrostatic heads develop which grow in number, areal extent and height as the depth increases; hydraulic heads may exceed 3000 m locally. A hydraulic head 'escarpment' appears gradually in the elevation range of 2212 1000 to 2212 2800 m along an arcuate line which tracks a major regional fault zone striking NE2013SW: heads drop stepwise by several hundred metres, at places 2000 m, from its north and west sides to the south and east. The escarpment forms a 'fluid potential bank' between a 'fluid potential highland' (50020132500 m) to the north and west, and a 'fluid potential basin' (1002013500 m) to the south and east. A 'potential island' rises 1000 m high above this basin further south. According to four vertical hydraulic sections, groundwater flow is controlled by the topography in the upper 20020131700 m of the basin; the driving force is orientated downwards beneath the highlands and upwards beneath the lowlands. However, it is directed uniformly upwards at greater depths. The transition between the two regimes may be gradual or abrupt, as indicated by wide or dense spacing of the hydraulic head contours, respectively. Pressure 'plumes' or 'ridges' may protrude to shallow depths along faults originating in the basement. The basement horsts appear to be overpressured relative to the intervening grabens. The principal thesis of this paper is that the two main driving forces of fluid flow in the basin are gravitation, due to elevation differences of the topographic relief, and tectonic compression. The flow field is unconfined in the gravitational regime, whereas it is confined in the compressional regime. The nature and geometry of the fluid potential field between the two regimes are controlled by the sedimentary and structural features of the rock units in that domain, characterized by highly permeable and localized sedimentary windows, conductive faults and fracture zones. The transition between the two potential fields can be gradual or abrupt in the vertical, and island-like or ridge-like in plan view. The depth of the boundary zone can vary between 400 and 2000 m. Recharge to the gravitational regime is inferred to occur from infiltrating precipitation water, whereas that to the confined regime is from pore volume reduction due to the basement's tectonic compression.},

At this time the Brent Group was at depths of between 2400 and 3000 m and reservoir temperatures ranged from 110 to 120°C. Extensive K—Ar dating shows that illitization, pre-oil emplacement, proceeded from the deepest reservoir panels along and up-structure. Fluid migration may have occurred along the deep seated Alwyn South-Ninian Fault System. Where the reservoir is lithologically homogeneous illite precipitation proceeded systematically base-upwards at rates of 5.5 m Ma-1. The duration of illite formation at any one level was between 2 and 8 Ma. In contrast, in heterolithic reservoirs fluid migration occurred initially along high permeability fairways and consequently illite ages do not vary systematically with depth.},

abstract = {In most deep sedimentary basins in the world, there is a layered arrangement of at least two superimposed hydrogeological systems. The shallowest hydrogeological system can extend to great depths; however, in many basins it extends from the surface down to only about 10,000 ft greatest historical depth of burial. The shallow hydrogeological systems generally are basin-wide in extent and exhibit normal pressures. The pore water apparently is free to migrate approximately in accordance with the theory of fluid migration proposed by Munn (1909) and quantified by Hubbert (1940 and 1953). The deeper hydrogeological systems usually are not basin-wide in extent and exhibit abnormal pressures. They generally consist of a layer of individual fluid compartments which are sealed off from each other and from the overlying system. In some basins, mainly in the onshore U.S., there is an even deeper, near normally pressured noncompartmented section. The compartmented layer in those basins generally is in the sequence of rocks which were deposited during the period of most rapid deposition. The underlying noncompartmented layer, where present, usually is in prebasin shelf deposits and basement rock. The uppermost noncompartmented layer usually is in rocks which were deposited during the last 10,000 ft in basin filling. Correlations of petroleum in reservoirs with the rocks from which the petroleum was generated has imposed a system of mainly upwards paths for the first several thousand feet of migration of petroleum from source rocks largely within the compartmented layer to pools generally in the shallow hydrogeological system. The migration paths of petroleum and water may not be coincident.},

In the present work, certain 2-D hydrothermal convection models have been analyzed using various permeability distributions and spatial configurations of fluid systems. Permeability anisotropy has also been included in some of the models, and variations of this parameter in the range 10-10-10-16 m2 have been considered. Numerical simulations reveal the possibility of considerable advective disturbances to the heat flow. These disturbances depend on the physical parameters, and strongly on the geometry of fluid circulation.

@article{Pedersen1994,
abstract = {Abstract Open fractures provide high-permeability pathways for fluid flow in sedimentary basins. The potential for flow along permeable or open fractures and faults depends on the continuity of flow all the way to the surface except in the case of convective flow. Upward flowing fluid cools and may cause cementation due to the prograde solubility of quartz, but in the case of carbonates such flow may cause dissolution. The rate and duration of these processes depend on the mechanisms for sustaining fluid flow into the fracture, the geometries of fracture and sedimentary beds intersected, permeability, pressure and temperature gradients. Heat loss to the adjacent sediments causes sloping isotherms which can induce non-Rayleigh convection. To analyse these problems we have used a simple model in which a single fracture acts as a pathway for vertically moving fluid and there is no fluid transport across the walls of the fracture except near its inlet and outlet. Four mechanisms for fluid flow into the lower part of the fracture are considered: decompression of pore water; compaction of intersected overpressared sediments; focusing of compaction water derived from sediments beneath the fracture; and finally focusing of pore water moving through an aquifer. Water derived from the basement is not considered here. We find that sustained flow is unlikely to have velocities much higher than 1-100 m/yr, and the flow is laminar. The temperature of the fluid expelled at the top of the fracture increases by less than 1% and the vertical temperature gradient in the fracture remains close to the geothermal gradient. Where hot water is introduced from basement fractures (hydrothermal water) during tectonic deformation, much higher velocities may be sustained in the overlying sediments, but here also this depends on the permeability near the surface. Most of the cooling of water with (ore) mineral precipitation will then occur near the surface. In most cases, pore water decompression and sediment compaction will yield only very limited pore water flux with no significant potential for cementation or heating of the sediments adjacent to the fracture. Focusing of compaction water from sediments beneath the fracture or from an intersected aquifer can yield fluxes high enough to cement an open fracture significantly but the flow must be sustained for a very long time. For velocities of 1-100 m/yr, it takes typically 0.3-30 Myr to cement a fracture by 50%. The highest velocities may be obtained when a fracture extends all the way to the surface or sea floor. When a fracture does not reach the sediment surface, the flow velocity is reduced by the displacement of water in the sediments near the top of the fracture. The flow into the fracture from the sediments may often be rate limiting rather than the flow on the fracture. Sedimentary rocks only a few metres from the fracture will receive a much lower flux than the fracture. The fracture will therefore close due to cementation before significant amounts of silica can be introduced into adjacent sandstones. The isotherm slope in the adjacent sediments will in most cases be less than 10-20o. Non-Rayleigh convection velocities in the sediments adjacent to the fracture are too small to cause any significant diagenetic reactions such as quartz cementation. These quantifications of fluid flow in fractures in sedimentary basins are important in terms of constraining models for diagenesis, heat transport and formation of ore minerals in a compaction-driven system.},

The initial high-resolution tomography down to a depth of 250 km did not image any columnar low-velocity anomaly which could be interpreted as a mantle plume anticipated beneath the Eger Rift, similar to recent findings of small plumes beneath the French Massif Central and the Eifel in Germany. Alternatively, we interpret the broad low-velocity anomaly beneath the Eger Rift by an upwelling of the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition. We also map lateral variations of seismic anisotropy of the mantle lithosphere from spatial variations of P-wave delay times and the shear wave splitting. Three major domains characterised by different orientations of seismic anisotropy correspond to the major tectonic units-Saxothuringian, Moldanubian and the Tepla-Barrandian-and their fabrics fit to those found in our previous studies of mantle anisotropy on large European scales.},

abstract = {The correlation between chemical weathering fluxes and denudation rates suggests that tectonic activity can force variations in atmospheric pCO2by modulating weathering fluxes. However, the effect of weathering on pCO2is not solely determined by the total mass flux. Instead, the effect of weathering on pCO2also depends upon the balance between 1) alkalinity generation by carbonate and silicate mineral dissolution and 2) sulfuric acid generation by the oxidation of sulfide minerals. In this study, we explore how the balance between acid and alkalinity generation varies with tectonic uplift to better understand the links between tectonics and the long-term carbon cycle. To trace weathering reactions across the transition from the Peruvian Andes to the Amazonian foreland basin, we measured a suite of elemental concentrations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Sr, Si, Li, SO4, and Cl) and isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr and $\delta$34S) on both dissolved and solid phase samples. Using an inverse model, we quantitatively link systematic changes in solute geochemistry with elevation to downstream declines in sulfuric acid weathering as well as the proportion of cations sourced from silicates. With a new carbonate-system framework, we show that weathering in the Andes Mountains is a CO2source whereas foreland weathering is a CO2sink. These results are consistent with the theoretical expectation that the ratio of sulfide oxidation to silicate weathering increases with increasing erosion. Altogether, our results suggest that the effect of tectonically-enhanced weathering on atmospheric pCO2is strongly modulated by sulfide mineral oxidation.},

abstract = {The chloride mass balance (CMB) method for estimating groundwater recharge is economic and effective, provided that the hydrological conditions for its applications are met and the modeling parameters are known. However, modeling parameters such as precipitation and Cl− deposition rates vary temporally, most notably as a result of the climatic changes from late Pleistocene to Holocene. The temporal variability of atmospheric Cl− input and annual precipitation were considered in this study by using a discrete steady state CMB model with different parameters for late Pleistocene and Holocene. Cl− deposition rates, estimated from 36Cl data, were lower in late Pleistocene than Holocene at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, but higher in late Pleistocene than Holocene at Black Mesa, Arizona. Paleoclimate proxies at both Yucca Mountain and Black Mesa point to higher precipitation rates in late Pleistocene than Holocene. The resulting average recharge estimates for Black Mesa are 9 ± 5 mm/yr for Holocene and 35 ± 22 mm/yr for late Pleistocene. Local recharge rates at Yucca Mountain were estimated from the 36Cl/Cl ratios and Cl− concentrations in perched waters. The estimated recharge for Yucca Mountain is 5 ± 1 mm/yr for Holocene and 15 ± 5 mm/yr for late Pleistocene. These recharge rates are comparable to results of independent numerical groundwater flow models and watershed-scale infiltration models at Black Mesa and Yucca Mountain, respectively.},

abstract = {Sandstone rheology and deformation style are often controlled by the extent of quartz cementation, which is a function of temperature history. Coupling findings from deformation experiments with a model for quartz cementation provide valuable insights into the controls on fault permeability. Subsiding sedimentary basins often have a transitional depth zone, here referred to as the ductile-to-brittle transition, above which faults do not affect fluid flow or form barriers and below which faults will tend to form conduits. The depth of this transition is partly dependent upon geothermal gradient. In basins with a high geothermal gradient, fault-related conduits can form at shallow depths in high-porosity sandstone. If geothermal gradients are low, and fluid pressures are hydrostatic, fault-related conduits are only formed when the sandstones have subsided much deeper, where their porosity (and hence fluid content) is low. Mineralization of faults is more likely to occur in areas with high geothermal gradients because the rocks still have a high fluid content when fault-related fluid-flow conduits form. The interrelationship between rock rheology and stress conditions is sometimes a more important control on fault permeability than whether the fault is active or inactive.},

abstract = {Analysis of the Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy of the Peel Block reveals the basin development of the block to have been influenced by both the inversion of the Roer Valley Graben and Central Netherlands Basin, and the overall Late Cretaceous transgression. Sediments of Santonian to Danian age were deposited on the block. These sediments are compared with the detailed lithostratigraphy of southern Limburg, where Late Cretaceous strata are exposed. Four successions can be recognised in southern Limburg. The two oldest successions, the Santonian Oploo Formation (new name, proposed in the present contribution) and the mainly Early Campanian Vaals Formation, are restricted to the central and northern parts of the block. These siliciclastic formations were deposited under the influence of inversion of the Roer Valley Graben and the Central Netherlands Basin, as well as under the influence of a rising sea level. Towards the north, sands of the Oploo Formation grade into marls and chalks of the Ommelanden Formation. The two youngest successions comprise the largely Late Campanian to Maastrichtian Gulpen and Maastricht Formations and the Danian Houthem Formation. These chalk formations were deposited under the influence of regional subsidence during a sea-level highstand. Subsequent to deposition of the Houthem Formation, a regional regression triggered a change from shallow-marine carbonate to paralic siliciclastic deposition.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the response of a sedimentary basin to compressional reactivation of extensional faults in distinct pulses. The inversion of the Broad Fourteens Basin in the southern Dutch North Sea is used as a case study. The first pulse of inversion occurred during the Late Mesozoic as a result of the sub-Hercynean phase. A second pulse occurred during the Mid-Palaeocene Laramide phase. A final inversion pulse occurred around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary coinciding with the Pyrenean tectonic event. We reconstructed the stratigraphic and structural development of the area during the Palaeogene in detail. Basic data are two 2D-seismic surveys, supported by 74 geophysical wireline logs, on which newly constructed depth and thickness maps are based. The reconstruction is aided by a quantitative subsidence analysis. Cessation of compression resulted in relaxation and tensional reactivation of faults caused differential subsidence. Inheritance of geological structures is a key element in the tectonic activity in the Broad Fourteens Basin during the Palaeogene; tectonic movement during the Palaeogene was always accommodated by reactivation of Palaeozoic-Mesozoic faults. The intensity of inversion in the southern North Sea Basin during the Pyrenean phase appears much larger than previously noticed. Moreover, the area affected by the inversion is much wider than during previous phases. Minor differences in the direction of the local stress field between the tectonic phases and by the deposition of a thick sedimentary succession during the periods of tectonic quiescence between the inversion phases can account for this.},

abstract = {The structural geologic interpretation of reflection seismic data is affected by conceptual uncertainty, par- ticularly in challenging onshore settings. This uncertainty can be significantly reduced by the integration of cross- section restoration and balancing techniques into the seismic interpretation workflow. Moreover, these tech- niques define a solid and comprehensive basis, grounding the interpretation and allowing a closer investigation of the deformation history that led to the interpreted structures. These benefits aredemonstrated on the basis of a case study from the eastern Jura Mountains in northern Switzerland. This mountain range was formed by a thin- skinned foreland fold-and-thrust belt with a multiphase prethrusting tectonic history. Despite significant seismic acquisition and processing efforts, seismic imaging of the strongly deformed parts of the belt widely remains ambiguous.We have developed a detailed systematic interpretation workflowthat is exemplified here for a single seismic profile across the Jura Main Thrust. Classical cross-section balancing techniques of equal bed lengths and areas were applied to validate and reinterpret the given seismic interpretation. Our results suggest that most of the observed structures resulted from thin-skinned deformation along a basal d{\'{e}}collement in Lower Triassic evaporites, which is generally inferred for the Jura Mountains. Nevertheless, secondary detachment levels in above lying strata have to be considered as well. The stepwise restoration of the analyzed cross section points toward different styles of thin-skinned deformation and possibly several episodes of earlier basement-rooted faulting events, which are indicated by subtle stratigraphic thickness changes. In summary, our workflow al- lowed us to significantly improve the original seismic interpretation, highlight specific deformation styles, and illuminate possible prethrusting deformation events that would otherwise be easily overlooked.},

abstract = {Moving fluids are capable of transporting a large amount of heat over long distances in sedimentary basins, but the effects are often ignored when modelling the thermal evolution of sedimentary basins. If significant, the passage of these heated fluids through the sediment pile will leave a thermal signature which can be measured at the present-day using palaeotemperature determinants such as vitrinite reflectance and apatite fission track analysis (AFTATM). The interpretation of palaeotemperature-depth profiles, particularly the slope of a palaeotemperature-depth profile, i.e. the palaeogeothermal gradient, allows fluid-induced temperature profiles to be distinguished from those due to simple conduction of basal heat flow. Steady-state systems, typified by large-scale lateral fluid flow in foreland basins or where low-temperature hydrothermal circulation systems occur associated with intrusions and thick volcanic piles, are characterized by dog-length geothermal gradients, with high-interval gradients near the surface, above the shallowest aquifer, and lower interval gradients beneath an aquifer. It is argued that the classic occurrence of near vertical vitrinite reflectance-depth profiles observed in many ancient foreland basins can result from this mechanism. Thermal effects of transient fluid flow are most easily observed at the present-day, where they are characterized by low or negative geothermal gradients beneath aquifers in active geothermal systems, and the same criterion enables their recognition in ancient situations. Similarly, shallow-level igneous intrusion into porous and permeable sediments can produce observable thermal signatures further from the intrusion than will result from simple conduction, but which can be readily explained by movement of fluids heated by the intrusion. Complex steady-state profiles that may be difficult to distinguish from transient profiles without additional geological data may arise where multiple aquifers are separated by aquitards. The thermal consequences of fluid flow in two of these situations, a foreland basin and igneous intrusion into porous sediments, are illustrated by examples of thermal history reconstruction from the Pliocene Papua New Guinea Fold Belt and the Canning Basin of Australia, respectively.},

abstract = {Deep groundwater in fractured crystalline basement has been reported from deep mines and from scientific deep wells. Highly saline brines have been described from several km depth in the continental basement of the Canadian, Fennoscandian and Ukrainian shields and elsewhere in the world. The origin of salinity is unknown and many different possibilities have been presented. We compare the compositional evolution of deep waters in the Black Forest basement, SW Germany, with those of other deep crystalline waters, and use halogen systematics (e.g. Cl/Br ratios) and other parameters of the waters to deduce the origin of their salinity. In the Black Forest the composition of deep thermal waters results from chemical interaction of surface water with the rock matrix (mainly weathering of plagioclase and mica) and from mixing of the reacted water with stagnant saline deep water. Here we show by Na/TDS-and Cl/TDS-investigations, by molality-ratios of the Na and Cl concentrations, and by Cl/Br systematics that these deep saline waters have a marine origin. The Cl/Br ratios in deep crystalline waters are very close to normal marine ratios (Cl/Br = 288 ppm basis). In contrast, Cl/Br ratios of other possible sources of salinity show distinctly different Cl/Br ratios: water derived from dissolved Tertiary halite deposits of the rift valley is in the order of Cl/Br = 2400 and water from dissolved Muschelkalk halite deposits has values of about Cl/Br = 9900. Leaching experiments on crystalline rocks, on the other hand, show that the average Cl/Br ratio of crystalline rocks is far below Cl/Br = 100.},

abstract = {Coastal aquifers are the subsurface equivalents of coastal areas where continental fresh groundwater and seawater meet. They can be composed of a variety of rock types including karstified lime- stone, fractured rock and unconsolidated sands. Their thickness varies from a few meters to over a kilometer. At the surface, conditions of land use, topography and climate can be highly variable. Despite a seemingly endless variety of possible aquifer characteristics, coastal aquifers share some common hydrogeolog- ical features. For instance, flow is typically influenced by density gradients and due to the characteristic composition of the fresh and seawater end members, distinct water quality patterns develop in mixing zones. Being located in geologically active environments, the distribution of water types is often influenced by long-term geological processes (e.g., sea level fluctuations). From a water management point of view, coastal aquifers are vulnerable to salinization of fresh ground water by seawater intrusion and up- coning. The future does not look too bright. The rising demand for fresh water, disruption of natural hydrological conditions, climate change and groundwater contamination will increase the stress on available water resources and valuable ecosystems. This essay will explore the present state of coastal aquifers, common problems and how hydrogeology as a scientific discipline can contribute to de- velop sustainable solutions.},

abstract = {We use data from western U.S. GPS networks to estimate the rate, pattern, and style of tectonic deformation of the central Basin and Range Province (BRP). Previous geodetic investigations have found the crust of eastern Nevada and western Utah to act as a rigid microplate, with zero deformation rates to within measurement uncertainty. Observed transients in GPS time series have led others to propose a megadetachment model, predicting that the central BRP behaves as a microplate, but with time-varying translation. Here we reassess these hypotheses, benefiting from a significant increase in GPS stations and time span, and innovations in analysis techniques. Our results show that the BRP crust deforms everywhere and all the time. In a group of 24 stations between longitude −113.5° and −116.8°, we find strain rates of 1.9 ± 0.2 × 10−9 yr−1 extension directed N55°W and 2.2 ± 0.2 × 10−9 yr−1 contraction directed N35°E, inconsistent with microplate behavior. The linearity of time series of strain from GPS station triplets is inconsistent with episodic translation of quasi-rigid domains. One exception is station EGAN that exhibits nonlinear motion not found in adjacent stations. The dominant signal in Nevada is distributed shear consistent with Pacific/North America relative plate motion, suggesting that stresses are transmitted through the lithosphere at least 800 km from the plate boundary. The observed active extension is consistent with earthquake focal mechanisms and is in agreement with integrated rates estimated from earthquake geology. Our results do not support the proposed megadetachment in the BRP.},

abstract = {Structural analysis of the Upper Cretaceous to Palaeogene succession in the Danish Central Graben suggests continuous inversion heralded in the Late Hauterivian and continuing into Palaeogene times. The following phases of increased intensity are identified: 1) latest Santonian, 2) Mid Cam- panian, 3) late Maastrichtian, 4) Late Paleocene – Eocene, and 5) Early Oligocene. Phases 1 through 3 are Sub-Hercynian, phase 4 is Laramide, and phase 5 is Pyrenean according to Alpine Orogen nomenclature. A temporal change in structural style is noted from early inversion confined to narrow zones associated with reverse faulting along pre-existing normal faults to late inversion dominated by gentle basinwide flexuring and folding. Inversion phases in the Danish Central Graben seem to be synchronous with inversion phases along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone. The location of inversion is generally spatially linked to Upper Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous depocentres, whereas older depocentres generally have remained intact. The origin of the compressional stress field is generally based on suggested compressional stresses transmitted into the foreland from the Alpine Orogen. In the Sub-Hercynian phase, orogenic compression dominated the Eastern Alps and Northern Carpathians to produce a likely NW ori- ented compression. However, structures in Denmark rather suggest a transpressional environ- ment resulting from NNE–SSW compression. Furthermore, transmission of Alpine orogenic stresses into the foreland commenced in the Turonian, a considerable time after the Late Hauterivian and later inversion precursors. Ridge-push forces transmitted from sea-floor spreading south of the Charlie-Gibbs fracture zone, particularly from the Goban Spur SW of Ireland, acting in conjunction with Alpine orogenic stresses are suggested as the cause for the stress field.},

abstract = {We describe how seafloor heat flow is determined, review current understanding of advective heat loss from oceanic lithosphere, and present results from three field areas to illustrate how heat flow measurements are used (along with complementary data) to resolve fluid flow rates and patterns. Conductive heat flow through much of the seafloor is lower than predicted by lithospheric cooling models as a result of hydrothermal circulation; this discrepancy is the basis for global estimates of the magnitude of advective cooling of oceanic lithosphere. Hydrothermal circulation also redistributes heat within the ocean crustal aquifer, leading to local variability. Heat flow studies in Middle Valley, a sedimented spreading center in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, indicate multiple scales of fluid circulation, delineate conditions at the top of a hydrothermal reservoir, and show the influence of primary and secondary convection. Heat flow studies on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge document the thermal influence of isolated basement outcrops surrounded by thick, low-permeability sediments. Warm hydrothermal fluids seep from the crust through a small volcanic edifice, having flowed into the crust through a larger outcrop similar to 50 km to the south. These fluids generate a local geothermal anomaly, but have little influence on regional heat loss from the plate. In contrast, heat flow surveys on part of the Cocos Plate, eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean, indicate that regional conductive heat loss is just 10-40% of predictions from lithospheric cooling models. Basement outcrops in this area focus massive discharge of cool, hydrothermal fluid and associated heat (4-80 x 10(3) l s(-1) of fluid, 0.8-1.4 GW of heat). Seafloor heat flow studies will be increasingly important in coming years for understanding marine hydrogeologic regimes and the role of fluids in a variety of Earth processes and settings.},

abstract = {The Westphalian C and D fluvial sandstones in the Campine Basin (north-east Belgium) are potential reservoirs for the sequestration of CO2 and interesting analogues of the hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Southern North Sea. Although these sandstones were deposited in a relatively short period of time, their reservoir properties and mineralogical compositions are very different. A petrographic study complemented with stable isotope analyses, fluid inclusion microthermometry and X-ray diffraction analyses of the clay fractions of the sandstones, which were sampled from deep boreholes (\textgreater1000 m) in the Campine Basin, revealed that these differences are related mainly to the climate at the time of deposition. The most important eogenetic processes affecting the Westphalian sandstones were the generation of a pseudomatrix by physical compaction of Al-silicates and lithic fragments that were strongly altered by extensive meteoric leaching, kaolinitization of unstable silicates and precipitation of siderite. These processes had a detrimental influence on the reservoir properties of Westphalian C sandstones, but their impact on the Westphalian D sandstones was minimal. The difference is assumed to be related to the climate at the time of deposition, which changed from tropical humid in the Westphalian C to semi-arid/arid during the Late Westphalian D. Both the Westphalian C and D sandstones were affected by similar mesogenetic processes. Mesogenetic quartz cementation resulted from chemical compaction and illitization of kaolinite, K-feldspar and smectitic clays. Illitization of kaolinite was controlled by the available quantities of co-existing kaolinite and K-feldspar and mainly affected the Westphalian D sandstones. Illitization of K-feldspar was controlled by the K-feldspar content. It had a much larger impact on the reservoir properties of the Westphalian D as, in these sandstones, K-feldspar was less affected by eogenetic alteration. The illitization of smectitic clays resulted in illite, quartz and ankerite cementation in both reservoirs. This process had a more important impact on the Westphalian C reservoir, since cementation here also resulted from smectite to illite conversion in the interbedded and underlying shales. The effect of mesogenetic alterations on the reservoir properties was much less drastic than the impact of eodiagenesis. Mesogenetic alterations do exert a significant control on the properties of the Westphalian D. The vast impact of eodiagenesis on the Westphalian C sandstones made them less susceptible to mesogenetic alteration. The effect of telogenetic processes on the porosity and permeability of the Westphalian sandstones was small and restricted to the top reservoir intervals that directly underlie the Cimmerian Unconformity. No significant telogenetic alterations related to the Variscan Unconformity were observed.},

abstract = {The saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil can be predicted using empirical relationships, capillary models, statistical models, and hydraulic radius theories. A well-known relationship between permeability and the properties of pores was proposed by Kozeny and later modified by Carman. The resulting equation is largely known as the Kozeny–Carman (KC) equation, although the two authors never published together. In the geotechnical literature, there is a large consensus that the KC equation applies to sands but not to clays. This view, however, is supported only by partial demonstration. This paper evaluates the background and the validity of the KC equation using laboratory permeability tests. Test results were taken from publications that provided all of the information needed to make a pre- diction: void ratio, and, either the measured specific surface for cohesive soils, or the gradation curve for noncohesive soils. The paper shows how to estimate the specific surface of a noncohesive soil from its gradation curve. The results presented here show that, as a general rule, the KC equation predicts fairly well the saturated hydraulic conductivity of most soils. Many of the observed discrepancies can be related to either practical reasons (e.g., inaccurate specific surface value; steady flow not reached; unsaturated specimens, etc.) or theoretical reasons (some water is motionless; hydraulic conductivity of soils is anisotropic). These issues are discussed in relation to the predictive capabilities of the KC equation.},

abstract = {Thermal modeling down to great depth, e.g. down to the Mohorovicic discontinuity, requires representative values of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity at an appropriate depth. Often there is a lack of data, especially concerning temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity, due to missing or questionable data from boreholes. Studies of the temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity showed that temperature is dominating. Thus measurements on a set of magmatic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks sampled from different depth levels of the Eastern Alpine crust were used to obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of both properties–at least for the area of investigation–and to give a review of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity ([lambda]), thermal capacity ([rho]xcp) and thermal diffusivity ([kappa]) for different types of rock. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity for crystalline (magmatitic and metamorphic) rocks is different to that of sedimentary rocks. Using the approach that the thermal resistivity (1/[lambda]) is a linear function of temperature whose slope increases with [lambda](0), the conductivity at a temperature of 0 [degree sign]C, two general equations were determined. The equation for crystalline rocks was verified in the temperature range of 0-500 [degree sign]C and the equation for sedimentary rocks was tested in the temperature range from 0 to 300 [degree sign]C. A general equation for the temperature dependence of [lambda] for Eastern Alpine rocks can thus be formulated:with empirical constants and corresponding uncertainties a=0.0030+/-0.0015 and b=0.0042+/-0.0006 for crystalline rocks. The constants for corresponding sedimentary rocks are a=0.0034+/-0.0006 and b=0.0039+/-0.0014. [lambda] is given in W m-1 K-1, T in [degree sign]C. At ambient conditions thermal diffusivity ([kappa]) and thermal conductivity ([lambda]) for Eastern Alpine crystalline rocks show the relationship:[kappa]=0.45x[lambda].},

However, this theory is inapplicable to virgin consolidation tests, where the deformation of the soil along the critical state surface is accomplished by elastic-plastic flow. In fact, Blot's model cannot even be applied to overconsolidated soils where the deformation is elastic, as it does not conserve the mass of the solid. In this paper, we provide a modified version of the model, and show how it can be extended to allow for elastic-plastic deformation and large-amplitude deformations in elastic-plastic compaction. A particular example of the potential application of this theory is to the groundwater flow induced by the compaction of sediments by an overriding ice sheet, and we show how the commonly used Dupuit approximation can be employed to simplify the theory.},

abstract = {Coastal fresh water sources, which discharge to the sea are expected to be directly influenced by climate change (e.g. increased frequency of extreme weather events). Sea-level rise and changes in rainfall patterns, changes in demand for drinking water and contamination caused by population and land use change, will also have an impact. Coastal waters with submarine groundwater discharge are of particular interest as this fresh water source is very poorly quantified. Two adjacent bays which host shellfish aquaculture sites along the coast of Co. Galway in the west of Ireland have been studied to establish the influence of fresh water inputs on nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in each bay. Neither bay has riverine input and both are underlain by the karst limestone of the Burren and are susceptible to submarine groundwater discharge. Water and suspended matter samples were collected half hourly over 13. h tidal cycles over several seasons. Water samples were analysed for nutrients and DOC, while suspended matter was analysed for organic/inorganic content. Temperature and salinity measurements were recorded during each tidal station by SBE 37 MicroCAT conductivity/temperature sensors. Long-term mooring data were used to track freshwater input for Kinvara and Aughinish Bays and compare it with rainfall data. Results show that Kinvara Bay is much more heavily influenced by fresh water input than Aughinish Bay, and this is a strong source of fixed nitrogen to Kinvara Bay. Only during flood events is there a significant input of inorganic nitrogen from fresh water to Aughinish Bay, such as in late November 2009. Fresh water input does not appear to be a significant source of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) to either bay, but is a source of DOC to both bays. C:N ratios of DOC/DON show a clear distinction between marine and terrestrially derived dissolved organic material. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Heat may be released catastrophically from the continental crust by the onset of free convection in orogenic zones. Orogeny itself could create the conditions necessary for free convection by increasing the permeability of the crust. In the specific case of a continental collision zone, the conditions favoring free convection may move progressively into continental interiors, perhaps to repeated episodes of convection and related thermal events. Simple models and assumptions suggest that individual episodes of convection circulation and heat release persist for periods of time of the order of 106 yr or less. The rate and magnitude of energy release depend upon the initial thermal state and permeability of the crust and the depth of fluid circulation. Estimates made from typical parameters indicate that the total thermal energy released from the crust is approximately equivalent to an increase of background heat flow from about 60 to 200 mW/m2 for a period of 106 yr. A significant amount of this heat can be transported into the interior of a continent by a gravity-driven flow system if a continuous aquifer of sufficient permeability is present. The hypothesis could explain several phenomena attributed to tectonically driven fluids associated with the Alleghenian-Ouachita orogeny. These include the formation of Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc deposits, widespread potassic alteration, and remagnetizations. Although speculative, the hypothesis is consistent with our current state of knowledge concerning the extent of fluid circulation in the continental crust.},

abstract = {Thermochronologic data collected along age-elevation profiles are commonly interpreted as recording temporally variant but spatially constant exhumation rates. However, thermochronologic age-elevation relationships are known to be perturbed by topographic effects and potential changes in relief, which are neglected in the inherently 1-D interpretation commonly applied. Such data thus potentially record both the denudation and relief history of the sampled region but extracting this information is challenging. In a companion paper, we develop a methodology for rigorously interpreting thermochronologic age-elevation profiles in terms of exhumation rates and relief development through time, and to independently quantify the resolution of these constraints. Here we test this approach using a thermochronological dataset consisting of apatite and zircon fission-track and (U-Th)/He data, collected at La Meije Peak in the Pelvoux-Ecrins massif (French Western Alps). Our data and models suggest a three-phase exhumation history in the Pelvoux-Ecrins massif, including a pulse of rapid exhumation at $\sim$�6-5.5�Ma, preceded and followed by more moderate rates of denudation in the order of 0.3-0.4�km�Myr-�1. This rapid exhumation event appears to occur coevally in other external crystalline massifs in the Alps but is not detected by qualitative inspection of the age-elevation relationships. Both our synthetic results and inversion of the La Meije data strongly suggest that apatite fission-track age-elevation relationships alone cannot resolve both denudation and relief histories independently and that multiple thermochronometers are required. Combining apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He ages and, particularly, including fission-track-length data greatly improves the resolution of the inferred exhumation histories. Although denudation rates through time and the timing of rate changes are generally well resolved, our data have insufficient resolution to satisfactorily constrain the relief history. Synthetic results reported in the companion paper suggest that the reason for this limitation is that relief increase through valley carving has been insufficient with respect to the regional denudation rates to be unambiguously extracted from the data.},

annote = {The common observation of sedimentary basin inversion in orogenic forelands implies that rifts constitute weak areas of the continental lithosphere. When compressed, the rifts respond with uplift of the deepest parts and erosion of sediments therein. Simultaneously, syn-compressional marginal troughs are formed flanking the inversion zone.

Since rifting and subsequent post-rift thermal re-equilibration are processes expected to alter the long-term mechanical state of the lithosphere, the phenomenon of basin inversion is non-trivial from a rheological point of view. Stochastic modelling of the long-term thermal structure beneath sedimentary basins indicates that the crustal part of a rift is warmer, and hence weaker, than the surrounding crustal blocks. In contrast, the mantle part is cold and strong beneath the basin centre.
In this paper, it is investigated whether the rifting-induced strength alterations constitute a sufficient condition for a thermally equilibrated rift to invert by compression. Numerical experiments with two-dimensional dynamic thermo-mechanical models are performed. In particular, the focus is on rifting-related mechanical instabilities that reduce the load bearing capacity of the lithosphere. In the experiments, strain-softening behaviour is introduced in the non-associated plasticity model representing brittle yielding. The result is self-consistent large-scale fault formation.
The models predict that the rifting-related necking instability induces differential crustal thinning increasing the post-rift crustal weakness. Strain softening and the associated fault formation amplifies the necking instability and introduces zones of structural weakness exposed for compressional re-activation.
Under these circumstances, basin inversion follows as a natural consequence of rift compression.},

An examination of the mechanisms that might produce such flow suggests that the only realistic possibility is head decay from an earlier higher water level caused by ancient recharge. Model studies suggest that for small basins, such recharge must have taken place within the last 1000 years and possibly within the last few hundred years, calling into question whether such resources should be labelled fossil. Recent palaeoclimatic studies of northern Chile show several pluvial periods throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, inaddition to long return period storm events, which continue to the present and which might have led to a series of pulsed flushing events in aquifers. Hence, it is incorrect to label groundwater resources as either fossil or actively recharged, as there is, in reality, a continuum between the two, and all such aquifers require site-specific evaluation and new, more flexible guidelines for development.},

A diurnal variation of SGD conductivity was found under the condition of semi-diurnal tidal changes over a period of 4 days. Both the ground resistivity and the conductivity of the discharged groundwater indicated that the freshwater-saltwater interface moved towards offshore at high tide, i.e. in the direction opposite to commonly made observations. SGD comprised a combination of Submarine Fresh Groundwater Discharge (SFGD) of terrestrial origin, and of Recirculated Saline Groundwater Discharge (RSGD) of marine origin. The maximum of the terrestrially derived fraction SFGD/SGD was found at a distance of 50 m offshore. A lower SFGD/SGD ratio was found closer to shore, where the highest SGD flux was measured. SGD conductivity and ground resistivity displayed a diurnal cyclicity at semi-diurnal tidal water level variations, indicating that tidal water level fluctuations may not be the primary driver of SGD flux, but preferential flow in volcanic hydrogeologic setting at Ubatuba. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {asin modeling aims at reconstructing the time evolution of a sedimentary basin in order to make quantitative predictions of geological phenomena leading to hydrocarbons accumulations. It accounts for porous medium compaction, heat transfer, hydrocarbon generation and fluid flow. Nevertheless, classical basin models handle simple geometry and are not usable in complex geometry area such as foothills. This is why, a numerical prototype Ceres, has been developed. This prototype is able to model three-phase flow in a 2D section of a basin, whose geometry changes through time accounting for deposition, compaction, erosion of the sediments, salt or mud creeping, and block displacement along faults. The classical flow chart to perform a case study is composed of three main steps. The first step is the building of the present day section. This is generally done with data coming from the seismic interpretation, wells, outcrops, and core data. At this stage, the section is generally balanced using software such as Locace. The second step is the restoration of the section. The section at present day is restored back in the past for each of the defined layer until the substratum is reached. In order to balance the section during time and to constrain the eroded parts of the section, we have to use a forward kinematic modeling tool such as Thrustpack. Thus, from a section restored with Locace before thrusting, the use of Thrustpack allows to construct intermediate sections during time, which are consistent from a kinematics point of view. The last step is the forward simulation. And, in order to solve the coupled equations that are generally used in basin models, we had to develop original numerical methods based on domain decomposition techniques. The previous methodology is the fruit of tests performed for an Alberta (Canada) transect and an eastern Venezuelan transect. When considering the origin of the fluids in the Oligocene sandstones of the El Furrial structure or in the Mississipian dolomite of the Canadian foothills, a general scenario of squeegee fluids is recognized. Before the flexuring and thrusting period, fluids are in equilibrium with the sediments. They are being continuously expelled toward the surface during the compaction related dewatering. Then, because of the tilting and thrusting with the deposition of synflexural sediments, an episode of squeegee fluid is created with flow along the stratification that can reach velocity of tens of kilometers per million of years. This squeegee episode stops when the thrusts of the considered area become active.},

abstract = {A new Moho depth map has been assembled for Western and Central Europe and the Western Mediterranean area that is exclusively based on published regional Moho depth maps. Tectonic overlays summarize Caledonian and Variscan tectonic units, Permo-Carboniferous fault systems and magmatic provinces, Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift-wrench systems, areas of intraplate compression, the outlines of Alpine orogens and the distribution of oceanic crust. Based on a comparison of these overlays with the Moho depth map we assess processes that controlled the evolution of the crust in the various parts of Europe through time. The present-day crustal configuration of Western and Central Europe results from polyphase Late Palaeozoic to recent lithospheric deformation that overprinted the margin of the Proterozoic East European Craton and particularly the Caledonian and Variscan crustal domains. Following consolidation of the Caledonides, their crustal roots were destroyed in conjunction with Devonian wrench tectonics and back-arc rifting. During the Permo-Carboniferous tectonomagmatic cycle, wrench faulting disrupted the crust of the Variscan Orogen and its foreland and the lithosphere of these regions was thermally destabilized. Late Permian and Mesozoic re-equilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system was interrupted by the development of the Arctic-North Atlantic, Tethyan and associated rift systems. During the Alpine orogenic cycle, intraplate compressional stresses controlled basin inversion-related crustal thickening and lithospheric folding, as well as the evolution of the Rhine-Rhone rift system. Variably deep crustal roots characterize the Alpine orogenic chains. Neogene back-arc extension disrupted the eastern Pyrenees, Betic-Balearic, Apennine and Dinarides orogens.},

abstract = {Data from 90 tracer experiments performed in low-permeability fractured media have been studied to explore correlations among parameters controlling flow and transport. The original data had been interpreted by different authors using different models, which prevents direct comparison of their estimated parameters. In order to produce comparable parameters, the data have been reexamined using simple models (homogeneous domain, steady-state flow regime, single porosity). Specifically, hydraulic conductivity has been derived as the ratio of water flux to head gradient and apparent porosity as the ratio of water velocity to water flux; the former estimated from both first and peak arrival times. Hydraulic conductivity and porosity correlate along a straight line of slope 1:3 in log scale. While the regression is too noisy to be of predictive use, it lends some support to the use of a generalized cubic law. The fact that correlation for first arrival time porosity (0.77) is larger than for peak arrival porosity (0.62) suggests that first arrival is controlled by the same flow paths as hydraulic conductivity. Apparent porosity derived from peak arrival time is found to grow with travel time along a line of 0.55 slope (again log scale). The correlation coefficient ranges between 0.73 and 0.80 (depending on the data set) for hard rocks. The fact that this correlation is maintained when varying the flow rate at a given site leads us to suggest that it is caused by diffusion mechanisms. This conclusion is further supported by the increase of apparent porosity with the matrix porosity of the rock on which the experiments were performed.},

abstract = {Due to the major role played by diatoms in the biological pump of CO2, and to the presence of silica-rich sediments in areas that play a major role in air-sea CO2 exchange (e.g. the Southern Ocean and the Equatorial Pacific), opal has a strong potential as a proxy for paleoproductivity reconstructions. However, because of spatial variations in the biogenic silica preservation, and in the degree of coupling between the marine Si and C biogeochemical cycles, paleoreconstructions are not straitghtforward. A better calibration of this proxy in the modern ocean is required, which needs a good understanding of the mechanisms that control the Si cycle, in close relation to the carbon cycle. This review of the Si cycle in the modern ocean starts with the mechanisms that control the uptake of silicic acid (Si(OH)4) by diatoms and the subsequent silicification processes, the regulatory mechanisms of which are uncoupled. This has strong implications for the direct measurement in the field of the kinetics of Si(OH)4 uptake and diatom growth. It also strongly influences the Si:C ratio within diatoms, clearly linked to environmental conditions. Diatoms tend to dominate new production at marine ergoclines. At depth, they also succeed to form mats, which sedimentation is at the origin of laminated sediments and marine sapropels. The concentration of Si(OH)4 with respect to other macronutrients exerts a major influence on diatom dominance and on the rain ratio between siliceous and calcareous material, which severely impacts surface waters pCO2. A compilation of biogenic fluxes collected at about 40 sites by means of sediment traps also shows a remarkable pattern of increasing BSi:Corg ratio along the path of the "conveyor belt", accompanying the relative enrichment of waters in Si compared to N and P. This observation suggests an extension of the Si pump model described by Dugdale and Wilkerson (Dugdale, R.C., Wilkerson, F.P., 1998. Understanding the eastern equatorial Pacific as a continuous new production system regulating on silicate. Nature 391, 270-273.), giving to Si(OH)4 a major role in the control of the rain ratio, which is of major importance in the global carbon cycle. The fate of the BSi produced in surface waters is then described, in relation to Corg, in terms of both dissolution and preservation mechanisms. Difficulties in quantifying the dissolution of biogenic silica in the water column as well as the sinking rates and forms of BSi to the deep, provide evidence for a major gap in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the competition between retention in and export from surface waters. The relative influences of environmental conditions, seasonality, food web structure or aggregation are however explored. Quantitatively, assuming steady state, the measurements of the opal rain rate by means of sediment traps matches reasonably well those obtained by adding the recycling and burial fluxes in the underlying abyssal sediments, for most of the sites where such a comparison is possible. The major exception is the Southern Ocean where sediment focusing precludes the closing of mass balances. Focusing in fact is also an important aspect of the downward revision of the importance of Southern Ocean sediments in the global biogenic silica accumulation. Qualitatively, little is known about the duration of the transfer through the deep and the quality of the material that reaches the seabed, which is suggested to represent a major gap in our understanding of the processes governing the early diagenesis of BSi in sediments. The sediment composition (special emphasis on A1 availability), the sedimentation rate or bioturbation are shown to exert an important control on the competition between dissolution and preservation of BSi in sediments. It is suggested that a primary control on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of BSi dissolution, both in coastal and abyssal sediments, is exerted by water column processes, either occuring in surface waters during the formation of the frustules, or linked to the transfer of the particles through the water column, which duration may influence the quality of the biogenic rain. This highlights the importance of studying the factors controlling the degree of coupling between pelagic and benthic processes in various regions of the world ocean, and its consequences, not only in terms of benthic biology but also for the constitution of the sediment archive. The last section, first calls for the end of the "NPZD" models, and for the introduction of processes linked to the Si cycle, into models describing the phytoplankton cycles in surface waters and the early diagenesis of BSi in sediments. It also calls for the creation of an integrated 1-D diagnostic model of the Si:C coupling, for a better understanding of the interactions between surface waters, deep waters and the upper sedimentary column. The importance of Si(OH)4 in the control of the rain ratio and the improved parametrization of the Si cycle in the 1-D diagnostic models should lead to a reasonable incorporation of the Si cycle into 3-D regional circulation models and OGCMs, with important implications for climate change studies and paleoreconstructions at regional and global scale. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Dome growth and explosive degassing are fundamental processes in the cycle of continental arc volcanism(1,2). Because both processes generate seismic energy, geophysical field studies of volcanic processes are often grounded in the interpretation of volcanic earthquakes(3). Although previous seismic studies have provided important constraints on volcano dynamics(4-6), such inversion results do not uniquely constrain magma source dimension and material properties. Here we report combined optical geodetic and seismic observations that robustly constrain the sources of long-period volcanic earthquakes coincident with frequent explosive eruptions at the volcano Santiaguito, in Guatemala. The acceleration of dome deformation, extracted from high- resolution optical image processing, is shown to be associated with recorded long-period seismic sources and the frequency content of seismic signals measured across a broadband network. These earthquake sources are observed as abrupt subvertical surface displacements of the dome, in which 20 - 50- cm uplift originates at the central vent and propagates at similar to 50 m s(-1) towards the 200- m- diameter periphery. Episodic shifts of the 20 - 80- m thick dome induce peak forces greater than 10(9) N and reflect surface manifestations of the volcanic long- period earthquakes, a broad class of volcano seismic activity that is poorly understood and observed at many volcanic centres worldwide(7). On the basis of these observations, the abrupt mass shift of solidified domes, conduit magma or magma pads may play a part in generating long- period earthquakes at silicic volcanic systems.},

abstract = {The vulnerability of groundwater to contamination is closely related to its age. Groundwaters that infiltrated prior to the Holocene have been documented in many aquifers and are widely assumed to be unaffected by modern contamination. However, the global prevalence of these ‘fossil' groundwaters and their vulnerability to modern-era pollutants remain unclear. Here we analyse groundwater carbon isotope data {(12C,} {13C,} {14C)} from 6,455 wells around the globe. We show that fossil groundwaters comprise a large share (42–85%) of total aquifer storage in the upper 1 km of the crust, and the majority of waters pumped from wells deeper than 250 m. However, half of the wells in our study that are dominated by fossil groundwater also contain detectable levels of tritium, indicating the presence of much younger, decadal-age waters and suggesting that contemporary contaminants may be able to reach deep wells that tap fossil aquifers. We conclude that water quality risk should be considered along with sustainable use when managing fossil groundwater resources.},

abstract = {Abstract The Urach 3 research borehole in south-west (SW) Germany has been drilled through the sedimentary cover, and the gneisses of the Variscian crystalline basement at 1600 m below the surface (Black Forest basement) has been reached. An additional 2800 m has been drilled through the fractured crystalline rocks, and the borehole has been used for a number of hydraulic tests in the context of a 'hot-dry rock' (HDR) project exploring for geothermal energy. The fracture system of the basement is saturated with a NaCl brine with about 70 g L-1 dissolved solids. Water table measurements in the borehole cover a period of 13 years of observation, during which the water table continuously dropped and did not reach a steady-state level. This unique set of data shows that the hydraulic potential decreases with depth, causing a continuous flow of fluid to the deeper parts of the upper continental crust. The potential decrease and the associated downward migration of fluid is an evidence for the progress of water (H2O)-consuming reactions in the crystalline rocks. Computed stability relations among relevant phases at the pressure temperature (PT) conditions in the fracture system and documented fossil fracture coatings in granites and gneisses suggest that the prime candidate for the H2O-consuming reaction is the zeolitization of feldspar. The potential of the gneisses to chemically bind H2O matches the estimated amount of migrating H2O.},

This paper investigates whether the steady-state thermal structure in itself can provide the necessary pattern of rheological weakening to facilitate compressional inversion of a sedimentary basin. By Monte Carlo simulation of a two-dimensional thermal finite element model we find that, generally, the maximum Moho temperature, and therefore also the weakest upper mantle, is encountered beneath the flanks of the basin. The reason for this is heat refraction deviating away from the central parts of the sedimentary cover and into the adjacent basement highs. The weakest crust, however, is located in the center of the basin due to sediment thermal blanketing, lower confining pressure, and the presence of relatively weak sediments.},

Seismologically determined thicknesses derived from representative P-wave residuals agree in most regions both with the magnetotelluric inferences of depths of the top of a layer of increased electrical conductivity and with the geothermally based calculations that allow inferences of the lithospheric thickness from surface heat-flow data. The seismological definition of the lithosphere as a high-velocity layer overlying the low-velocity zone in the upper mantle seems to be close to the geothermal concept in which the lithospheric base is defined by temperatures near partial melting, decreasing the seismic velocities and increasing the electrical conductivity. Interpretations of seismic data used for constraining geothermal models of the deep lithosphere assume velocity variations to reflect mainly changes in the mineral composition. However, recent observations of large-scale seismic anisotropy show clearly that, in the subcrustal lithosphere, velocity variations due to anisotropy caused by preferred orientations of olivine crystals can be much larger than the velocity variations caused by temperature or compositional changes.},

abstract = {Quantifying long-term exhumation rates is a prerequisite for understanding the geodynamic evolution of orogens and their exogenic and endogenic driving forces. Here we reconstruct the exhumation history of the central Aar and Gotthard external crystalline massifs in the European Alps using apatite and zircon fission track and apatite (U-Th)/He data. Age-elevation relationships and time-temperature paths derived from thermal history modeling are interpreted to reflect nearly constant exhumation of &#8764;0.5 km/Ma since &#8764;14 Ma. A slightly accelerated rate (&#8764;0.7 km/Ma) occurred from 16 to 14 Ma and again from 10 to 7 Ma. Faster exhumation between 16 and 14 Ma is most likely linked to indentation of the Adriatic wedge and related thrusting along the Alpine sole thrust, which, in turn, caused uplift and exhumation in the external crystalline massifs. The data suggest nearly steady, moderate exhumation rates since &#8764;14 Ma, regardless of major exogenic and endogenic forces such as a change to wetter climate conditions around 5 Ma or orogen-perpendicular extension initiated in Pliocene times. Recent uplift and denudation rates, interpreted to be the result of climate fluctuations and associated increase in erosional efficiency, are nearly twice this &#8764;0.5 km/Ma paleoexhumation rate.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling and dimensional analysis is used to study the salinization of thick, high-permeability aquifers by free convection from a salt source at the surface. Current understanding of this process mainly concerns the initial stages of salinization only (boundary-layer development, break-up into fingers and initial phase of finger descent). In the modeling, special attention is paid to the role of two processes in the long-term salinization rate: (1) the progressive loss of salt from fingers by lateral diffusion, and (2) the coalescence of fingers during their descent. From the numerical simulations a relationship is derived that describes the development of the horizontally averaged salinity with depth and time as a function of permeability and initial-density contrast for aquifer Rayleigh numbers up to Ra =6,000. This relationship is consistent with and provides an extension to previous generalized relationships of the rate of finger descent. Its applicability to real-world aquifers (Ra >105) that include complexities due to anisotropy, heterogeneity, and mechanical dispersion is discussed. Application to the Pleistocene coastal aquifer of the Netherlands (thickness ≈200 m, permeability ≈10-11 m2) suggests that salinization of the aquifer during historic episodes of inundation by seawater occurred within decades.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal deposits in extensional settings are common worldwide. These deposits are generally assumed to have formed from circulating fluids that mix with other fluids. However. the driving force for the circulation remains unclear in many cases. Here we present a model to explain the upward release of significant amounts of fluid from deeper crustal levels during extension, without the need to invoke fluid circulation cells. Compared to rocks, aqueous fluids are about ten times more compressible. Exhumation due to crustal thinning or denudation causes an instantaneous decrease in overburden pressure, without much change in fluid pressure in isolated pores. This implies that the relative fluid pressure increases during exhumation. and fluid needs to be expelled to maintain the original relative fluid pressure. Pore fluids at lithostatic pressure need to expel approximately 5% of their volume for every 100 MPa decompression of their host rock. We show that significant amounts of fluid (in the order of 10(-3) to 10(-4) km(3) fluid per km(2) crustal column) can be released this way during extensional events. Crustal heating may have the same effect, owing to the much larger thermal expansion of fluids compared to rocks. The proposed model was tested on the Schwarzwald hydrothermal ore district in SW Germany. Five different generations of mineralization, all formed during extensional events, could be distinguished based on mineralogy, geochemistry and age. We show that release of pore fluid that is driven by decompression and/or heating can supply sufficient amounts of fluid to account for the observed tonnages of gangue minerals in these hydrothermal deposits.

Only limited heating of the crust is caused by lithospheric thinning. In the simple but realistic situation where heat conduction is substantially faster than heat advection, no major thermal disturbance is associated with the downward movement of the hanging wall. Radiometric ages and fault rocks associated with the Lugano-Val Grande normal fault demonstrate that cooling rather than heating affected the crust during normal faulting. This pattern is not compatible with such a simple numerical model and is explained by a waning thermal anomaly induced by a magmatic intrusion immediately preceding or overlapping with the first stages of normal faulting. The magmatic body must have been emplaced at depths greater than 15-18 km, and probably started to cool in the Carnian i.e. few million years before the onset of normal faulting along the Lugano-Val Grande fault.},

abstract = {Deciphering erosion rates over geologic time is fundamental for understanding the interplay between climate, tectonic, and erosional processes. Existing techniques integrate erosion over different time scales, and direct comparison of such rates is routinely done in earth science. On the basis of a global compilation, we show that erosion rate estimates in glaciated landscapes may be affected by a systematic averaging bias that produces higher estimated erosion rates toward the present, which do not reflect straightforward changes in erosion rates through time. This trend can result from a heavy-tailed distribution of erosional hiatuses (that is, time periods where no or relatively slow erosion occurs). We argue that such a distribution can result from the intermittency of erosional processes in glaciated landscapes that are tightly coupled to climate variability from decadal to millennial time scales. In contrast, we find no evidence for a time scale bias in spatially averaged erosion rates of landscapes dominated by river incision. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the proposed coupling between climate and tectonics, and interpreting erosion rate estimates with different averaging time scales through geologic time.},

abstract = {The complex West Netherlands Basin contains oil and gas in Triassic and Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous clastic reservoir sequences. The understanding has always been that the Carboniferous coal measures have generated only gas and the Jurassic marine Posidonia Shale only oil. However, detailed geochemical analyses show that both source rocks have generated oil and gas. Geochemical fingerprinting established a correlation of the hydrocarbons with the main source rocks. The occurrence of these different hydrocarbons is consistent with migration routes. Map-based charge modeling shows that the main phase of hydrocarbon generation occurred prior to the Late Cretaceous inversion of the West Netherlands Basin. However, along the southwest flank of the basin and in lows between the inversion highs, significant charge continued during the Tertiary. Biodegradation of oils in Jurassic and Cretaceous reservoirs occurred during the earliest Tertiary, but only in reservoirs that were at that time at temperatures of less then 70 to 80[degrees]C, where bacteria could survive. This study shows that also in a mature hydrocarbon province an integrated hydrocarbon habitat study with modern analyses and state-of-the-art technology can lead to a much improved understanding of the distribution of oil and gas in the subsurface. The results of this study will allow a better risk assessment for remaining prospects, and an improved prediction of the type of trapped hydrocarbons in terms of gas, oil, and biodegraded oil.},

abstract = {The Southeast Basin in southern France is part of the north European continental margin of the Mezosoic Tethys. The original amount and extent of the Mesozoic sedimentary cover across this basin margin (formed from the Variscan Massif Central basement) is unknown and has been the subject of much debate. We have used apatite fission-track thermochronology to better understand Mesozoic sedimentation and later erosion histories of this region. Thirty-three outcrops and borehole samples were collected from Paleozoic granitic and metamorphic basement and Paleozoic and Triassic sandstones in broadly E-W transects. Except from a restricted area (Vivarais), measured fission-track ages are \textless130 Ma with mean track lengths between 10.7 and 13.8 [mu]m. Thermal histories based on fission-track age and length data are consistent with an episode of cooling that began at 130+/-10 Ma for the northern part of the study area and at 110+/-10 Ma for the southern part. This cooling is interpreted to be the result of denudation. The thickness of eroded rocks is estimated between 2000 and 2500 m, depending on the geothermal gradient and on the thermal conductivity of eroded rocks. The greatest amount of denudation occurred in the southern part of the study area. The presence of thin Triassic and Early Jurassic sediments preserved on the top of the Variscan basement implies that only a small part of the total thickness of eroded material corresponds to basement rocks. Paleogeographical data argue against a Triassic-Early Jurassic sedimentary cover thick enough to explain the recorded temperatures. This study suggests that the basement was buried beneath a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) sedimentary cover, which has been removed from mid-Cretaceous time. This interpretation differs strongly from earlier studies where the maximum onlap of the Southeast Basin deposits onto the basement was restricted to thin Early Jurassic rocks. Onset of denudation can be related to geodynamic events which affected southern France in mid-Cretaceous time, and that resulted from the opening of the Bay of Biscay (140-110 Ma).},

abstract = {Coarse fluvial deposits of the Soledad Member of the Gueydan Formation were derived from the Trans-Pecos volcanic field (TPVF), but the proportions of clast types in the deposits do not match present outcrop abundances in the TPVF. Basalt and mafic trachyte are most abundant in Soledad conglomerate and sandstone, durable trachyte forming the largest clasts. In contrast, the surviving remnant of the TPVF is dominated by silicic lava and tuff.  The basaltic and trachytic clasts most closely resemble rocks within some of the younger ([$\sim$]32-27 Ma) units in the Davis, Chinati, and Bofecillos mountains of the TPVF. Our data suggest that these and similar units were much more widespread at the time of Gueydan deposition and were largely stripped from the TPVF during erosion (1-2 km).  Gueydan deposition may have been associated with regional uplift of the TPVF accompanying the onset of Basin and Range extension. This uplift would have provided the steep gradient necessary to transport coarse detritus from the TPVF to the Gulf Coast. Basin and Range extension eventually disrupted the course of the ancestral Rio Grande-Rio Conchos, thereby cutting off the supply of volcanic detritus and ending Gueydan deposition.},

abstract = {A critical review of dispersivity observations from 59 different field sites was developed by compiling extensive tabulations of information on aquifer type, hydraulic properties, flow configuration, type of monitoring network, tracer, method of data interpretation, overall scale of observation and longitudinal, horizontal transverse and vertical transverse dispersivities from original sources. This information was then used to classify the dispersivity data into three reliability classes. Overall, the data indicate a trend of systematic increase of the longitudinal dispersivity with observation scale but the trend is much less clear when the reliability of the data is considered. The longitudinal dispersivities ranged from 10-2 to 104 m for scales ranging from 10-1 to 105 m, but the largest scale for high reliability data was only 250 m. When the data are classified according to porous versus fractured media there does not appear to be any significant difference between these aquifer types. At a given scale, the longitudinal dispersivity values are found to range over 2-3 orders of magnitude and the higher reliability data tend to fall in the lower portion of this range. It is not appropriate to represent the longitudinal dispersivity data by a single universal line. The variations in dispersivity reflect the influence of differing degrees of aquifer heterogeneity at different sites. The data on transverse dispersivities are more limited but clearly indicate that vertical transverse dispersivities are typically an order of magnitude smaller than horizontal transverse dispersivities. Reanalyses of data from several of the field sites show that improved interpretations most often lead to smaller dispersivities. Overall, it is concluded that longitudinal dispersivities in the lower part of the indicated range are more likely to be realistic for field applications.},

Therefore, in 1973 a control network with levelling profiles across the eastern Rhine Graben fault was installed and measured in the vicinity of the city of Basel in order to measure relative vertical movements and investigate their relationship with seismic events. As a contribution to EUCOR-URGENT, the profiles were observed a third time in the years 2002 and 2003 and connected to the Swiss national levelling network. The results of these local measurements are discussed in terms of accuracy and significance. Furthermore, they are combined and interpreted together with the extensive data set of recent vertical movements in Switzerland (Jura Mountains, Central Plateau and the Alps). In order to be able to prove height changes with precise levelling, their values should amount to at least 3–4 mm (1$\sigma$). The present investigations, however, have not shown any significant vertical movements over the past 30 years.},

abstract = {Free thermal convection and mixed convection are considered as potential mechanisms for mass and heat transport in sedimentary basins. Mixed convection occurs when horizontal flows (forced convection) are superimposed on thermally driven flows. In cross section, mixed convection is characterized by convection cells that migrate laterally in the direction of forced convective flow. Two-dimensional finite-element simulations of variable-density groundwater flow and heat transport in a horizontal porous layer were performed to determine critical mean Rayleigh numbers for the onset of free convection, using both isothermal and semi-conductive boundaries. Additional simulations imposed a varying lateral fluid flux on the free-convection pattern. Results from these experiments indicate that forced convection becomes dominant, completely eliminating buoyancy-driven circulation, when the total forced-convection fluid flux exceeds the total flux possible due to free convection. Calculations of the thermal rock alteration index (RAI=q{\textperiodcentered}∇T) delineate the patterns of potential diagenesis produced by fluid movement through temperature gradients. Free convection produces a distinct pattern of alternating positive and negative RAIs, whereas mixed convection produces a simpler layering of positive and negative values and in general less diagenetic alteration.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Bottom-hole temperatures (BHT) from oil exploration provide useful constraints on the subsurface thermal regime, but they need to be corrected to obtain the equilibrium temperature. In this work, we introduce several BHT correction methods and compare them using a large Australian data set of more than 650 groups of multiple BHT measurements in about 300 oil exploration boreholes. Existing and suggested corrections are classified within a coherent framework, in which methods are divided into: line/cylinder source; instantaneous/continuous heat extraction; one/two component(s). Comparisons with reservoir test temperatures show that most of the corrections lead to reliable estimates of the formation equilibrium temperature within +-10 oC, but too few data exist to perform an intercomparison of the models based on this criterion. As expected, the Horner method diverges from its parent models for small elapsed times (or equivalently large radii). The mathematical expression of line source models suffers from an unphysical delay time that also restrains their domain of applicability. The model that takes into account the difference of thermal properties between circulating mud and surrounding rocks-that is the two-component model-is delicate to use because of its high complexity. For these reasons, our preferred correction methods are the cylindrical source models. We show that mud circulation time below 10 hr has a negligible effect. The cylindrical source models rely on one parameter depending on the thermal diffusivity and the borehole radius, which are poorly constrained, but the induced uncertainty on the extrapolations remains reasonably low.},

@article{Caine2009,
abstract = {The San Ysidro fault is a spectacularly exposed normal fault located in the northwestern Albuquerque Basin of the Rio Grande Rift. This intrabasin fault is representative of many faults that formed in poorly lithified sediments throughout the rift. The fault is exposed over nearly 10 km and accommodates nearly 700 m of dip slip in subhorizontal, siliciclastic sediments. The extent of the exposure facilitates study of along-strike variations in deformation mechanisms, architecture, geochemistry, and permeability. The fault is composed of structural and hydrogeologic components that include a clay-rich fault core, a calcite-cemented mixed zone, and a poorly developed damage zone primarily consisting of deformation bands. Structural textures suggest that initial deformation in the fault occurred at low temperature and pressure, was within the paleosaturated zone of the evolving Rio Grande Rift, and was dominated by particulate flow. Little geochemical change is apparent across the fault zone other than due to secondary processes. The lack of fault-related geochemical change is interpreted to reflect the fundamental nature of water-saturated, particulate flow. Early mechanical entrainment of low-permeability clays into the fault core likely caused damming of groundwater flow on the up-gradient, footwall side of the fault. This may have caused a pressure gradient and flow of calcite-saturated waters in higher-permeability, fault-entrained siliciclastic sediments, ultimately promoting their cementation by sparry calcite. Once developed, the cemented and clay-rich fault has likely been, and continues to be, a partial barrier to cross-fault groundwater flow, as suggested by petrophysical measurements. Aeromagnetic data indicate that there may be many more unmapped faults with similar lengths to the San Ysidro fault buried within Rio Grande basins. If these buried faults formed by the same processes that formed the San Ysidro fault and have persistent low-permeability cores and cemented mixed zones, they could compartmentalize the basin-fill aquifers more than is currently realized, particularly if pumping stresses continue to increase in response to population growth.},

The new technique involves producing arbitrary constant flow rates through a rigidly confined clay sample, using a multispeed syringe pump, and measuring the gradients induced thereby with a differential pressure transducer. This procedure avoids the errors in the conventional technique that arise from atmospheric contamination and from the long time intervals needed to obtain measurable flow rates. The results presented, together with the previous evidence, suggest that Darcy's law is valid in many saturated natural clays and clayey sediments, but that exceptions may occur in extremely fine-grained clays and also where high gradients are present in shallow, unconfined sediments or in granular soils containing small amounts of clay.

Relatively small scale non-glacial catchments are replaced by catchments which are integrated on the scale of continental ice sheets. Simulations are presented of the response to glaciation of a large part of the western European groundwater system during the last two (Saalian, Weichselian) glacial cycles. A two-dimensional model along an ice sheet flowline from western Sweden to The Netherlands illustrates the impact of glaciation on flow in the vertical plane, and a vertically integrated model illustrates its impact on areal patterns of flow. Hydraulics heads, hydraulic gradients and flow velocities are increased far above their modern values, and relatively shallow aquifers are completely flushed out during glacial periods. There are significant implications for groundwater chemistry and geological structures. Large seepage pressures generated near to ice sheet margins and major impacts on the distribution of effective pressures will produce structures such as hydrofractures, sediment dykes, sediment volcanoes, loading structures etc. The model can be readily applied to hydrocarbon resorvoirs.},

In the Acqui Terme-Visone area, these geothermal waters ascend along zones of high vertical permeability and discharge at the surface almost undiluted or mixed with cold, shallow waters. To the SW of Acqui Terme, other ascending geothermal waters, either undiluted or mixed with low-salinity waters, enter relatively shallow secondary reservoirs, where they reequilibrate at 65-70??C. Both chemical and isotopic data indicate that bacterial SO4 reduction affects all these waters, especially those discharged by the secondary reservoirs. Therefore, geothermal waters must get in contact with oil, acquiring the relatively oxidized organic substances needed by SO4-reducing bacteria. This oil-water interaction process deserves further investigations, for potential economic implications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The basin records the major tectonic events of the western part of the Eurasian Plate, i.e. opening and closure of the Tethys and opening of the Atlantic. From earlier Triassic to Late Jurassic, the Paris Basin was a broad subsiding area in an extensional framework, with a larger size than the present-day basin. During the Aalenian time, the subsidence pattern changes drastically (early stage of the central Atlantic opening). Further steps of the opening of the Ligurian Tethys (base Hettangian, late Pliensbachian;...) and its evolution into an oceanic domain (passive margin, Callovian) are equally recorded in the tectono-sedimentary history. The Lower Cretaceous was characterized by NE-SW compressive medium wavelength unconformities (late Cimmerian-Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary and intra-Berriasian and late Aptian unconformities) coeval with opening of the Bay of Biscay. These unconformities are contemporaneous with a major decrease of the subsidence rate. After an extensional period of subsidence (Albian to Turonian), NE-SW compression started in late Turonian time with major folding during the Late Cretaceous. The Tertiary was a period of very low subsidence in a compressional framework. The second folding stage occurred from the Lutetian to the Lower Oligocene (N-S compression) partly coeval with the E-W extension of the Oligocene rifts. Further compression occurred in the early Burdigalian and the Late Miocene in response to NE-SW shortening. Overall uplift occurred, with erosion, around the Lower/Middle Pleistocene boundary.},

abstract = {Growth faults within the Frio Formation define six subbasins on the South Texas shelf and add to the complexity of the sediment dispersal along the shelf margin. These growth faults influenced sediment pathways, controlled sediment partition and provided increased accommodation for deltaic depocenters. Rollover and thickening of sediments occur on the downthrown side of growth faults with offsets of at least 150m and up to 750m. Growth strata are indicated by intervals that thicken landward (by several tens of meters) from anticline crests. Individual 4th-order (100-500ky) regressive cycles expand about five to seven times across growth faults; expansion ratios as great as 10 are observed. The shelf edge is associated with the largest displacement, expansion ratios and thickness of prograding deltaic sequences. Sedimentary structures and trace-fossil associations identified in cores from Nueces, Encinal and Red Fish Bay subbasins indicate deposition on a wave-dominated deltaic shoreline. The cores exhibit highly bioturbated muddy sandstones alternating with decimeter-thick clean sandstones with hummocky cross-stratification. Alternation of fair-weather wave deposits with sandy storm beds in two successive fault zones suggests that all subbasins developed under similar conditions during growth-fault development. High sediment supply conditions favored accumulation of thicker sediments on the downthrown sides of the faults. Wave dominance of deltas on the outer shelves in the growth compartments suggest that building of the upper slope rather lowers slope margin, and decreases the likelihood of the presence of sandy deep water fans. Correlation of about 700 well logs integrated with seismic data provided the areal distribution and relative timing of sediment filling of the growth-faulted compartments to unravel the evolution of higher-order (fourth and fifth) sequences affected by these growth faults. Core data were used to recognize depositional environments, to calibrate lithology to well logs and to characterize seismic amplitude anomalies. Within this shoreface succession the clean sandy storm beds will make attractive hydrocarbon reservoirs especially on the crest of rollover anticlines in downthrown compartments. These sandstone bodies pinch out seaward into open marine shelf mudstones and are sealed by overlying shelf mudstones deposited during transgressive episodes.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents depth maps for eight key horizons and seven thickness maps covering the onshore and offshore areas for the Late Permian to recent sedimentary section of the Netherlands. These maps, prepared in the context of a TNO regional mapping project, are supported by nine regional structural cross sections and a table summarizing the timing of tectonic activity from Carboniferous to recent. These new regional maps enable the delineation of various structural elements but also reveal the development of these elements through time with improved detail. Since the latest Carboniferous the tectonic setting of the Netherlands changed repeatedly. During successive tectonic phases several pre-existing structural elements were reactivated and new elements appeared. The various identified regional structural elements are grouped into six tectonically active periods: Late Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. This study demonstrates that many structural elements and fault systems were repeatedly reactivated and that a clear distinction exists between long-lived elements, such as the Roer Valley Graben, and short-lived structural elements, such as the Terschelling Basin.},

abstract = {By subsidence analysis on eighteen surface sections and 6 wells, which cover large part of the Iberian Basin (E Spain) and which are marked by high-resolution stratigraphy of the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous, we quantify the complex Permian and Mesozoic tectonic subsidence history of the basin. Backstripping analysis of the available high resolution and high surface density of the database allows to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of tectonically driven subsidence to a much higher degree than previous studies. The sections and wells have also been forward modelled with a new `automated' modelling technique, with unlimited number of stretching phases, in order to quantify variations in timing and magnitude of rifting. It is demonstrated that the tectonic subsidence history in the Iberian Basin is characterized by pulsating periods of stretching intermitted by periods of relative tectonic quiescence and thermal subsidence. The number of stretching phases appears to be much larger than found by earlier studies, showing a close match with stretching phases found in other parts of the Iberian Peninsula and allowing a clear correlation with discrete phases in the opening of the Tethys and Atlantic.},

SGD rates measured by manual seepage meters ranged from 5.5 to 19.3 L/min/m (with an average of 12.1 L/min/m), which was 0.6 and 5.9 times the SGD determined in Florida and Perth, respectively. The spatial distribution of SGD was found to be highly variable along ???300 m long coast area. Semi-diurnal SGD variations which anti-correlated with tide were found using newly developed automated seepage meters that can provide continuous SGD data with high resolution. These variations may be attributed to the tidal effect, when a greater hydraulic gradient, observed at low tide, moves groundwater from land to the ocean, and an opposite effect is observed at high tide. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, we propose that annealing of these irradiation defects may be an important phenomenon and may be significant in case of slowly-cooled or reheated basement rocks. To test this hypothesis, we developed a quantitative model including an explicit treatment of $\alpha$-recoil damage, annealing, and their effect on He-diffusion kinetics, and calibrate it against literature data. Our model is based on two hypotheses: (1) helium is in equilibrium between an apatite crystal and its defects and (2) alpha-recoil damage annealing can be described analogously to fission-track annealing. This model has been embedded into a Monte Carlo simulation of helium production/ejection/diffusion and applied to data from the French Massif Central; a complex slowly-cooled terrain with burial reheating, where the thermal history has been constrained by previous fission-track (FT) data including FT length distributions. (U–Th)/He ages are close to the FT ages from the same samples and are generally reproducible among replicates, but some samples present He-age dispersion that is not correlated with crystal size. Our model reproduces the Massif Central data very well except for three samples where He ages are older than corresponding FT ages. We show that annealing of irradiation damage has an important impact on retentivity of helium and that the He content, [He] is only a rough approximation of the damage level. In particular our results show that independence of He ages on crystal sizes, in case of reheated samples, is a clear indication of the higher He retentivity induced by $\alpha$-recoil defects and that an explicit treatment of defect annealing is required for a correct interpretation of (U–Th)/He ages in such a case. More generally a correlation with the crystal size can bring information on the thermal path only if the age of defects, well represented by the fission-track age, is available, due to the dependence of the partial retention zone on damages.

Model development was based on the density dependent fluid flow approach with water table and dynamic tidal boundary conditions. The peformance of the model was compared against data collected from the Columbia Aquifer on the eastern shore of Virginia. The dynamic tidal boundary conditions were necessary to reproduce the surficial mixing zone observed within the groundwater intertidal zone of the aquifer. The model was able to reproduce field data on the movement of the near-shore water table, ground water salt concentrations and ground water discharge rates and patterns. The model was not able to replicate the short-term fluctuation in salt concentration observed within the surficial mixing zone. The inability to account for the wave action of the tides within the intertidal zone is believed to be responsible for this difficulty. The development of the model provided a new method to investigate ground water discharge to coastal systems.},

abstract = {Quantitative subsidence analysis for a number of rifted basins in the northern Atlantic/Mediterranean region provides evidence for rapid phases of PlioQuaternary subsidence. The observed acceleration in tectonic subsidence occurs after a phase of general quiescence in subsidence in these basins and deviates from predictions of stretching models. The latter indicate a decay of subsidence with time after Mesozoic-Tertiary basin formatioh and a slow tectonic subsidence in Plio-Quaternary times. A possible explanation for the observed patterns of anomalous subsidence could be an increase in the level of intraplate compression in the northern Atlantic region. Intraplate stress changes in the Plio-Quaternary are related to the dynamics of African/ Eurasian collision processes and a reorganization of spreading directions in the AtlAntic, possibly reflecting a plate reorganization of global nature. It seems that the Plio-Quaternary record reflects a period of increased levels of neotectonic activity, interplaying with periods of (de)glaciation. Stress-induced topography in the onshore parts of continental margins, coupled with the stress-induced subsidence in the offshore deeper parts of the basins, could have contributed to recent phases of uplift in Fennoscandia, augmenting the uplift induced by glacial unloading. Estimates of ice thicknesses are directly inferred from the observed uplift ignoring other driving mechanisms whereas topography plays a crucial role in the dynamics of glaciation. It is, therefore, important to quantdy the interplay of rapid tectonic uplift and subsidence phases with climatic effects during the Plio-Quaternary.},

Within the resolution of the measurements, heat flow is constant across faults that intersect the borehole, suggesting that fluid flow does not alter the conductive thermal regime. Reanalysis of regional heat flow reveals an increase in heat flow along the SAF northwest of Parkfield. This transition corresponds to a shallowing base of seismicity and a change in fault behavior near the northern terminus of the M6 1966 Parkfield earthquake rupture. The persistence of elevated heat flow in the Coast Ranges to the west appears to rule out frictional heating on the SAF as the source of the SAFOD value.},

We focus on laboratory processes, namely, plastic compaction of aggregates, elastic-brittle deformation of granular rocks, dilatant and thermal microcracking of dense rocks, chemically driven processes, as a way to approach naturally occurring geological processes. In particular, the chemically driven processes and their corresponding evolution permeability-porosity relationships are discussed in relation to sedimentary rocks diagenesis.},

Topographically-driven flow is generally the most efficient mechanism for mass and heat transport, and therefore has recently been favoured in theories of the origin of Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc deposits. The magnitude of heat transport by fluid movement in the crust has an exponential dependence upon the depth of circulation. In areas of the continental crust with appreciable topography gradients (c.0.01) and permeabilities greater than c. 10-17m2, the background thermal state will likely be appreciably perturbed by groundwater movement. Fluid circulation in the upper crust is both continuous and pervasive due to topography and fluid-density gradients. The old conception of the continental crust as an unchanging body of solid rock should be replaced by a paradigm that recognizes the continental crust as a two-component system; a solid framework which continuously evolves through thermal, chemical, and mechanical interaction with crustal fluids.},

The distribution of earthquake recurrence intervals is more\n scattered, with a mode of 1–3 k.y., a mean of 11 k.y., and 15% of\n recurrence intervals >20 k.y. While strike-slip faults nearest the plate\n boundary show relatively steady slip rates through time, northern Great\n Basin normal faults have had marked temporal slip-rate variations in the\n Quaternary. Since 15 ka, strain release has been concentrated near the\n margins (fault slip rates to 1–2 mm/yr), with the central region being\n nearly inactive. However, over the past 150 k.y., finite deformation is\n more evenly distributed as faults show more uniform slip rates (0.2–0.3\n mm/yr) consistent with their long-term rates. The paleo-earthquake\n distribution since ca. 60 ka shows two kinematic patterns: local clusters\n (episodes of events repeated on a single fault) and regionally distributed\n faulting (episodes of events distributed across several parallel faults,\n each with a single event). We thus propose a model for northern Great\n Basin normal faults where they alternate between (1) transient fast\n periods (1–2 mm/yr) lasting ∼50 k.y., characterized by local clusters; and\n (2) transient slow periods (0.05–0.1 mm/yr) lasting 200–400 k.y.,\n characterized by regional distributed faulting.},

abstract = {Current conceptual models for groundwater flow in beaches highlight an upper saline plume, which is separated from the lower salt wedge by a zone of brackish to fresh groundwater discharge. There is currently limited knowledge of what conditions allow an upper saline plume to exist and what factors control its formation. We used variable-density, saturated-unsaturated, transient groundwater flow models to investigate the configuration of the freshwater-saltwater interface in beaches with slopes varying from 0.1 to 0.01, in the absence of waves. We also varied hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, tidal amplitude and inflow of fresh groundwater. The simulated salinity configuration of the freshwater-saltwater interfaces varied significantly. No upper saline plumes formed in any beach with hydraulic conductivities less than 10 m/d. The slope of the beach was also a significant control. Steeper beach faces allowed stronger upper saline plumes to develop. Median sediment grain size of the beach is strongly correlated to both beach slope and permeability, and therefore the development of an upper saline plume. Prior studies of groundwater flow and salinity in beaches have used a range of theoretical dispersivities and the appropriate values of dispersivity to be used to represent real beaches remains unclear. We found the upper saline plume to weaken with the use of larger values of dispersivity. Our results suggest that upper saline plumes do not form in all beaches and may be less common than previously considered.},

abstract = {We have reconstructed the kinematic, thermal and rheological evolution of the Triassic-Cretaceous South Alpine passive continental margin (Northern Italy) and estimated lateral strength variations associated with rifting. Rifting initially caused the formation of a roughly symmetrical, ca. 100 km wide graben located 150-200 km away from the future break-up site. 30 Myr after the onset of rifting, the rift axis shifted laterally and eventually led to oceanic crust formation. The thermal evolution of the margin was first controlled by the waning of a thermal anomaly, which was emplaced shortly before rifting and was cooling during the first extensional stages. Numerical modelling of rifting and drifting, constrained by field data, is used to trace thermal and rheological changes affecting the rifted margin. The effects of the thermal anomaly are restricted to the first 10-20 Myr of rifting. Subsequently, isotherms are slightly affected by lithospheric thinning and show very little distortion after break-up. Rheological modelling demonstrates that the South Alpine lithosphere preserved substantial strength even shortly before break-up and became stronger thereafter. The modelling also shows that, at break-up and 100 Myr later, thinned domains of the margin are stronger than the less thinned ones.},

abstract = {The Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) is located between the West European rift and the North Sea rift system. During the Cenozoic, the RVRS was characterized by several periods of subsidence and inversion, which are linked to the evolution of the adjacent rift systems. Combination of subsidence analysis and results from the analysis of thickness distributions and fault systems allows the determination of the Cenozoic evolution and quantification of the subsidence. During the Early Paleocene, the RVRS was inverted (Laramide phase). The backstripping method shows that the RVRS was subsequently mainly affected by two periods of subsidence, during the Late Paleocene and the Oligocene-Quaternary time intervals, separated by an inversion phase during the Late Eocene. During the Oligocene and Miocene periods, the thickness of the sediments and the distribution of the active faults reveal a radical rotation of the direction of extension by about 70-80[deg] (counter clockwise). Integration of these results at a European scale indicates that the Late Paleocene subsidence was related to the evolution of the North Sea basins, whereas the Oligocene-Quaternary subsidence is connected to the West European rift evolution. The distribution of the inverted provinces also shows that the Early Paleocene inversion (Laramide phase) has affected the whole European crust, whereas the Late Eocene inversion was restricted to the southern North Sea basins and the Channel area. Finally, comparison of these deformations in the European crust with the evolution of the Alpine chain suggests that the formation of the Alps has controlled the evolution of the European crust since the beginning of the Cenozoic.},

@article{Faure2002,
abstract = {As ice caps expanded during each of the last five glaciations, sea level fell at least 120 m below current levels, exposing continental shelves worldwide to create vast areas of new land. As a result of this exposure, the ecology, climate, pedology, and geology of global shorelines were dramatically transformed, which in turn altered the carbon cycle and biodynamics of this new landmass. In this paper, we focus on a little-known hydrogeological phenomenon that may have had profound influences on biodiversity, human evolution, and carbon storage during periods of severe climatic stress of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. We propose that freshwater springs appeared on emerged continental shelves because falling sea level not only drew down and steepened the coastal water table gradient, thus increasing the hydrostatic head on inland groundwater aquifers, but also removed up to 120 m of hydrostatic pressure on the shelf, further enhancing groundwater flow. We call this phenomenon the "coastal oasis", a model based on three well-established facts. (1) In all coastal areas of the world, continental aquifers discharge a continuous flow of fresh water to the oceans. (2) Many submarine sedimentary and morphological features, as well as seepages and flow of fresh water, are known on and below the shelves from petroleum explorations, deep-sea drilling programs, and mariners' observations. (3) Hydraulic principles (Darcy's law) predict increased groundwater flow at the coast when sea level drops because the piezometric head increases by the equivalent depth of sea-level lowering. Sea level is presently in a relatively high interglacial position. Direct observation and verification of our model is difficult and must rely on explorations of terrain that are now deeply submerged on continental shelves. For this reason, we draw parallels between our predicted model and simple, well-exposed terrestrial hydrological systems, such as present-day springs that appear on the exposed shores of lakes whose free-air water levels fell during periods of aridity. Such modern examples are seen in the Caspian Sea and Dead Sea, the Afar Depression, and the Sahara Desert. These modern analogues demonstrate the likelihood that underground water will be more abundant on emerged shelves during sea-level fall, causing springs, oases, and wetlands to appear. Our model creates an apparent paradox: in tropical and subtropical arids lands, such as most of Africa, sea-level fall during hyperarid glacial phases would produce abundant fresh water flow onto emerged continental shelves as the continental interior desiccated. Thus, emergent shoreline springs provided new habitats for terrestrial vegetation and animals displaced from the interior by increasingly arid conditions, shrinking ecosystems, and dwindling water supplies. Such a scenario would have had a profound influence on the vegetation that spreads naturally to colonize the emerged shelves during glacio-eustatic sea-level lowstands, as well as creating new habitats for terrestrial mammals, including early humans. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Temperature profiles of 22 observation boreholes in the Ishikari basin were investigated in order to extract information on the ground thermal processes and the associated water flow disturbances. Data analyses methods were based on temperature profile typology, thermal gradient-temperature plots, and a thermo-hydraulic model. The distributed data sets of measured temperature profiles and thermal conductivity show lateral heat flow variations from 34 to 162 mW m-2. These thermal conditions revealed the co-existence of a highland geothermal field, a lowland central subnormal heat flow area, and a strong heat flow anomaly near the northeast Ishikari River. To explain this specific configuration of the thermal field, possible effects of petro-physical properties, topography and groundwater movements were examined with a three-dimensional thermo-hydraulic simulation model. Laboratory measurements of thermal conductivity, porosity, density, and permeability from borehole core samples were used to constrain the model parameters. The main results suggest that: the lateral increase of geothermal gradient and heat flow density with elevation, i.e. in the southwest direction, are essentially due to hydro- and thermo-physical differences between the hydrogeologically active Quaternary sedimentary system and the underlying Tertiary volcano-sedimentary formation; the low heat area in the central lowland may be explained by the effect of its local groundwater flow recharge, and then the positive heat anomaly near the Ishikari River would result from a basin-wide heat flow redistribution by water flow. In general, the thermal regime in the Ishikari basin appears dominated by conduction processes in the southwest area and strongly influenced by advection phenomena in the northeast.

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) can be an important pathway for transport of nutrients and contaminants to estuaries. A better understanding of the geologic and hydrologic controls on these fluxes is critical for their estimation and management. We examined geologic features, porewater salinity, and SGD rates and patterns at an estuarine study site. Seismic data showed the existence of paleovalleys infilled with estuarine mud and peat that extend hundreds of meters offshore. A low-salinity groundwater plume beneath this low-permeability fill was mapped with continuous resistivity profiling. Extensive direct SGD measurements with seepage meters (n=551) showed fresh groundwater discharge patterns that correlated well with shallow porewater salinity and the hydrogeophysical framework. Small-scale variability in fresh and saline discharge indicates influence of meter-scale geologic heterogeneity, while site-scale discharge patterns are evidence of the influence of the paleovalley feature. Beneath the paleovalley fill, fresh groundwater flows offshore and mixes with saltwater before discharging along paleovalley flanks. On the adjacent drowned interfluve where low-permeability fill is absent, fresh groundwater discharge is focused at the shoreline. Shallow saltwater exchange was greatest across sandy sediments and where fresh SGD was low. The geologic control of groundwater flowpaths and discharge salinity demonstrated in this work are likely to affect geochemical reactions and the chemical loads delivered by SGD to coastal surface waters. Because similar processes are likely to exist in other estuaries where drowned paleovalleys commonly cross modern shorelines, the existence and implications of complex hydrogeology are important considerations for studies of groundwater fluxes and related management decisions.},

abstract = {We use a combination of apatite 4He/3He, (U-Th)/He, and fission-track thermochronology to date slip on the Surprise Valley fault in northeastern California by analyzing a single sample from the Warner Range in the footwall of the fault. This sample, a granitic clast from a conglomerate, yielded a fission-track age of 11.6 {+/-} 2.8 Ma and a (U-Th)/He age of 3.02 {+/-} 0.52 Ma. Geologic relationships indicate that this sample was buried to a depth of $\sim$3.3 km prior to exhumation during slip on the Surprise Valley fault. Fission-track age and length data indicate that the sample was fully reset (>120 {degrees}C) prior to exhumation, which began sometime after 14 Ma. A single aliquot of nine apatite grains was step-heated for 4He/3He analysis; modeling of the resulting 4He distribution indicates that cooling from >80 {degrees}C to $\sim$20 {degrees}C occurred between 3 and 1 Ma. Interconsistent time-temperature (t-T) solutions to the combined 4He/3He, (U-Th)/He, and fission-track data require two distinct periods of cooling, consistent with non-continuous slip on the Surprise Valley fault. Early cooling and fault slip took place between 14 and 8 Ma, followed by more recent fault slip ca. 3 Ma. This timing is consistent with both local geologic relationships and with the regional timing of faulting along the western margin of the Basin and Range Province. These data demonstrate the resolving power of combined fission-track, (U-Th)/He, and 4He/3He thermochronometric data to extract low-temperature t-T information from a single sample close to Earth's surface.},

The palaeoclimate proxy record indicates subtropical temperatures and humid conditions for the Late Callovian and Early Oxfordian interval. Thereafter, the results show stepwise warming and aridization. The onset of this trend can be related to global palaeogeographical changes associated with the breakup of Pangea. The aridity and temperature reached their maximum development during the Late Kimmeridgian and Portlandian. In the earliest Cretaceous, the climate returned to slightly cooler, tropical and humid conditions. When combined with regional palaeogeographical reconstructions, these conditions suggest that the recorded Late Kimmeridgian to Portlandian arid phase may be linked to the arrival of cooler high latitude waters to the North Sea region due to the opening of the North Atlantic seaway connecting the warm Tethys Ocean in the south to the Boreal Ocean.},

abstract = {Chalk is the most characteristic facies type of the Upper Cretaceous in Belgium and the only Cretaceous rock type found on the central and northern parts of the Brabant Massif. Marine Cretaceous deposits gradually encroached the Brabant Massif from the south during transgressive pulses starting in the Cenomanian – Turonian, displaying chalk facies from the Coniacian onwards. The chalk cover on the northern part of the Brabant Massif and in the Campine basin was not installed until the late Santonian and Campanian, while inversion of the Rur Valley Graben prevented any sedimentation. The base of the chalk deposit is diachronic and may be laterally equivalent to more detrital, continental-marine facies. Flooding was gentle, covering a peneplanated landscape, while partly preserving the saprolitic paleosol and thus not influencing the chalky nature of the sediment. Peneplanation did not erase all irregularities in paleotopography, leading to differences in timing of the onset of marine sedimentation, in accommodation space and sediment thickness across the axis of the Brabant Massif. Subsequent uplift of the Brabant Massif relative to the Campine Basin led to progressive disappearance of the Maastrichtian and erosion cutting into the chalk in a southern direction. South of the axis of culmination of the Brabant Massif, in the southern half of West-Flanders, the chalk forms the latest Cretaceous formation, partially preserved. North of the axis of culmination, in the northern part of West- and East-Flanders and the westernmost part of the province of Antwerp, the chalk forms the earliest Cretaceous formation, equivalent to the more detritic sediments of the Campine basin which were supplied by the inverted Roer Valley Graben. In contrast to the Mons sedimentary-tectonic basin to the south, where the standard lithostratigraphical scale of the Belgian Cretaceous has been established, the Coniacian to Campanian chalk deposits on the Brabant Massif cannot be differentiated lithologically. A formal lithostratigraphic unit, the Nevele Formation, is introduced comprising all chalk deposits on the Brabant Massif.},

abstract = {To evaluate compaction as a factor in porosity evolution, a plot of intergranular volume vs. depth was constructed using data from relatively uncemented reservoir sandstones from a variety of depths, ages, and geographic locations. The resulting intergranular- volume-decline curve reveals that sands compact mechanically and intergranular volume declines rapidly, from about 40 to 42% at the surface, to about 28% at 1500 m. Between about 1500 and 2500 m, intergranular volume continues to decline slowly, until the framework stabilizes at around 26% (maximum potential porosity in the absence of cement or matrix). No further significant decrease in intergranular volume is observed to the depth limits of the data set at 6700 m. Comparison of intergranular volume and volume of quartz cement for different formations reveals no obvious balance between intergranular pressure solution (as monitored by inter- granular volume) and quartz cementation. This indicates that grain- to-grain pressure solution and quartz cement precipitation do not proceed concomitantly on the thin-section scale. Moreover, grain compaction is limited (to about 26% intergranular volume) in rigid- grain sandstones, which suggests that the occurrence and distribu- tion of deep porosity is a function of the volume of cement available to fill the intergranular pores. Therefore, deep, porous sandstones are relatively uncemented rather than undercompacted.},

abstract = {To understand the evolution of the Alpine orogen, knowledge of the actual structure of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system is important. We perform high-resolution teleseismic tomography with manually picked P wave arrival times from seismograms recorded in the greater Alpine region. The resulting data set consists of 4199 relative P wave arrivals and 499 absolute P wave arrivals from 76 teleseismic events, corrected for the contribution of the Alpine crust to the travel times. The three-dimensional (3-D) crustal model established from controlled-source seismology data for that purpose represents the large-scale Alpine crustal structure. Absolute P wave arrival times are used to compute an initial reference model for the inversion. Tests with synthetic data document that the combination of nonlinear inversion, high-quality teleseismic data, and usage of an a priori 3-D crustal model allows a reliable resolution of cells at 50 km × 50 km × 30 km. Hence structures as small as two cells can be resolved in the upper mantle. Our tomographic images illuminate the structure of the uppermost mantle to depth of 400 km. Along strike of the Alps, the inversion reveals a high-velocity structure that dips toward the SE beneath the Adriatic microplate in the western and central Alps. In the eastern Alps we observe a northeastward dipping feature, subducting beneath the European plate. We interpret this feature in the western and central Alps as subducted, mainly continental European lower lithosphere. For the east, we propose that parts of the Vardar oceanic basin were subducted toward the NE, forcing continental Adriatic lower lithosphere to subduct northeastward beneath the European plate.},

The relationships between deformation mechanisms along fault zones and their impact on the hydrogeological structure of the fault zone are analyzed in a shallow (0–5 m below land surface) trench over one of the faults in the study area. Recently developed digital-image-analysis techniques are used to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity at the millimeter-scale and to describe the micromorphologic characteristics of the fault zone. In addition, laboratory measurements of hydraulic conductivity on core-plug samples show the larger-scale distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the damage zone flanking the main fault plane. Particulate flow is the deformation mechanism at shallow depths, which causes the damage zone around the fault, in the sand-rich parts, to have a relatively enhanced hydraulic conductivity. The fault core is characterized by reduced hydraulic conductivity due to clay smearing, grain-scale mixing, and iron-oxide precipitation.},

abstract = {Flexural forward modelling of the syn-rift section and flexural backstripping of the post-rift section has been conducted on four cross-sections through the Pattani Basin. The extension ([beta]) for the syn-rift section of 1.2-1.3 is considerably smaller than that estimated from the post-rift section ([beta]=2-2.4). This appears to represent a real discrepancy, rather than just a problem with accurate measurement of extension in the syn-rift section. The syn-rift section, particularly in the northern half of the Pattani Basin, has an overall synformal geometry atypical of rifts. Not all the syn-rift subsidence can be modelled as extension-related (unlike typical half grabens). Consequently it is proposed that the Pattani Basin developed due to both extensional faulting, and as a synformal basin developed over a ramp-flat geometry along a major low-angled extensional fault in the upper crust. Overall the discrepancy in upper crustal extension estimated from forward modelling vs. ductile lithspheric extension estimated from backstripping suggests that active mantle processes (e.g. a mantle plume) or non-uniform extension (subduction rollback) operated beneath the Gulf of Thailand.},

Reshear of existing cohesionless faults that are favorably oriented for frictional reactivation within the stress field provides the lower limiting bound to overpressures and inhibits development of other brittle structures. Formation of drainage conduits by hydraulic extension fracturing is important only in the case of intact caprock under low differential stress. Brittle-failure- mode plots demonstrate that maximum overpressure is inversely related to the level of differential stress and that high overpressures are easier to sustain in compressional regimes. Changes in the regional stress state in areas of overpressuring (for example, during tectonic inversion) may induce significant fluid redistribution.},

abstract = {3.1. IntroductionThe formation and alteration of clay minerals and their accumulation as clay materials can occur by a very wide range of processes. In one way or another, however, most of these processes and the environments in which they operate involve the chemical actions and physical movement of water. As such, clay minerals can be considered the characteristic minerals of the Earth;s near surface hydrous environments, including that of weathering, sedimentation, diagenesis/low-grade metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration (Fig. 3.1). Simply defined, the weathering environment is that in which rocks and the minerals they contain are altered by processes determined by the atmosphere, hydrosphere and the biosphere. Soil formation, also known as pedogenesis, occurs in the weathering environment. The sedimentary environment is the zone in which, soil, weathered rock and mineral (and biogenic) materials are eroded, mixed and deposited as sediments by water, wind and ice. Diagenesis involves all those physical and chemical processes that occur between sedimentation and metamorphism, whilst hydrothermal alteration encompasses the interactions between heated water and rock.In this chapter, the origins of the various clay minerals that may occur in each of these environments are reviewed along with the processes that may lead to their accumulation and alteration, usually together with other components, to form clay materials. In many instances, clay materials are formed in one environment by the accumulation or alteration of clay minerals formed in others. Thus the geological history of a clay material, and consequently its properties and behaviour, may depend on many},

It evaluates how well a number of existing porosity‐permeability equations such as the Kozeny‐Carman equation fit a compilation of data on the permeability of pure sands and clays.

While experiments have confirmed the dependence of permeability on stress, field measurements of crystalline permeability have not previously yielded an unambiguous and universal relation between permeability and depth in the shallow crust (<2.5km). Large datasets from Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland provide new opportunities to characterize the permeability of crystalline rocks in the shallow crust. Crystalline rock permeability has been measured in situ at various depths in metamorphic and intrusive lithologies, as well as in active and inactive tectonic settings. The importance of different variables such as depth, lithology, and tectonic setting was examined by dividing the permeability data into different categories and comparing these categories using the nonparametric Kolmogorov‐Smirnov (KS) test. Both intrusive and metamorphic lithologies display a statistically significant logarithmic decrease of permeability with depth, although again with a low predictive power.},

Slow seepage through the rock matrix and fast flow through conduits and fractures result in a high variation in spring response to precipitation events. Contaminant storage occurs in the rock matrix and epikarst, but contaminant transport occurs mostly along preferential pathways that are typically inaccessible locations, which makes modeling of karst systems challenging. Computer models for understanding and predicting hydraulics and contaminant transport in aquifers make assumptions about the distribution and hydraulic properties of geologic features that may not always apply to karst aquifers. This paper reviews the basic concepts, mathematical descriptions, and modeling approaches for karst systems. The North Coast Limestone aquifer system of Puerto Rico (USA) is introduced as a case study to illustrate and discuss the application of groundwater models in karst aquifer systems to evaluate aquifer contamination.},

abstract = {<p>Various human activities, including agriculture, water consumption, river damming, and aquaculture, have intensified over the last century. This has had a major impact on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling in global continental waters. In this study, we use a coupled nutrient-input, hydrology, in-stream nutrient retention model to quantitatively track the changes in the global freshwater N and P cycles over the 20th century. Our results suggest that, during this period, the global nutrient delivery to streams increased from 34 to 64 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup> and from 5 to 9 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, in-stream retention and removal grew from 14 to 27 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup> and 3 to 5 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup>. One of the major cause of increased retention is the growing number of reservoirs which now account for 24 and 22 % of global N and P retention/removal in freshwater systems, respectively. This increase in nutrient retention could not balance the increase in nutrient delivery to rivers with the consequence that river nutrient transport to the ocean increased from 19 to 37 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup> and from 2 to 4 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup>. Human activities have also led to a global increase in the molar N : P ratio in freshwater bodies.</p>},

abstract = {Numerical solutions of the coupled equations of fluid flow and heat transport are used to investigate how the near-surface thermal regime is perturbed by groundwater flow in a basin with a three-dimensional water table configuration. We consider specifically those conditions where the hydraulic gradient on the water table drives the flow system, thermally induced buoyancy forces modify but do not control the flow field. The hydrologic disturbance of the thermal field and the significance of a water table gradient transverse to the regional slope depend upon the interplay of the three-dimensional water table configuration, the basin geometry including the depth to the basal impermeable boundary, the anisotropy, and the permeability of the subsurface formations. These factors act together to determine groundwater flow patterns, depths of circulation along individual flow lines, and areal distribution of groundwater recharge and discharge. The uniformity of surface heat flow values determined from a series of shallow boreholes in an advectively disturbed regime will depend on the location of the measurement sites relative to the hinge line separating areas of groundwater recharge and discharge and on the extent of the region centered about the hinge line where fluid inflow/outflow rates are insufficient to perturb the thermal field.},

abstract = {This article reports on current knowledge of coastal karst aquifers, in which conduit flow is dominant, and its aim is to characterise the functioning of these systems which are closely linked to the sea. First, earlier and recent studies of these aquifers are discussed. On the basis of their findings, it can be shown that two essential mechanisms are involved in the functioning of these systems, i.e., aquifer discharge through submarine springs and saline intrusion through conduits open to the sea. Then, the conditions that give rise to these aquifers are described and particular emphasis is placed on the influence of deep karstification when the sea level falls. The base-level variations are attributed to the glaciations or, in the specific case of the Mediterranean, to the salinity crisis in the Messinian period. It is this inherited structure, sometimes containing very deep conduits below sea level, that today conditions the aquifer flow. The flow in the conduits open to the sea depends on the hydraulic head gradient between the aquifer and the sea and is therefore a function of the water density and head losses in the aquifer. This survey of coastal karst aquifers has revealed some common characteristics that show the development and/or functional capacity of their karstic drainage networks. A classification of such systems into three categories is proposed with the aim of assisting in the decision-making concerning potential exploitation of water resources in coastal regions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Drury1989,
abstract = {The apparent linear relationship between surface heat flow, Q and heat generation, A, is usually interpreted in terms of heat flow provinces i.e., terrains that have a common tectonothermal history and a uniform mantle component of heat flow. The slope, D, of the linear regression of heat flow on heat generation is an indication of the thickness of the upper heat-producing layer. For many terrains D is numerically similar to the depth of a major mid-crustal transition zone. These observations are modelled by a two-layer crust consisting of an upper layer, approximately 10–15 km thick, of variable heat generation, underlain by a layer about 20 km thick in which heat generation is lower and more uniform than that in the upper layer. The model is well able to simulate Q-A regression parameters for different sets of real data. It is also consistent with other geological and geophysical observations.  The higher and more variable heat generation of the upper layer is consistent with ideas concerning removal of heat-producing elements from the lower layer during amphibolite to granulite metamorphism and their redistribution into the upper crust. Further redistribution of heat-producing elements may occur in zones of hydrothermal circulation whose depth is a function of stress, pressure and temperature, and which may migrate vertically in response to stress changes during uplift and erosion.  Large-scale metamorphism to granulite facies has been postulated as one mechanism for stabilisation of continental crust in the late Archaean. It is shown, however, that redistribution of heat-producing elements in such a process would have only a small effect on crustal geotherms, so that partitioning of heat production was not a major factor in the crustal stabilisation.},

@article{VanBalen1998,
abstract = {In-plane horizontal stresses acting on predeformed lithosphere induce differential flexural vertical motions. A high-precision record of these motions can be found in the sedimentary record of rifted basins. Originally, it was proposed that rifted basins experience flank uplift and basin center subsidence in response to a compressive change of in-plane stress, which agrees well with observed differential motions. Subsequently published models predicted that the vertical motions may be opposite because of the flexural state of the lithosphere induced by necking during extension. However, the total, flexural and permanent, geometry of the lithosphere underlying the rifted basin is the controlling parameter for the in-plane stress-caused vertical motions. The largest part of this preexisting geometry is caused by faulting in the uppermost brittle part of the crust and ductile deformation in the underlying parts of the lithosphere. We present a new multilayered model for stress-induced differential subsidence, taking into account the technically induced preexisting geometry of the lithosphere, including faults in the upper crust. As continental lithosphere may exhibit flexural decoupling due to a weak lower crustal layer, the new multilayer in-plane stress model discriminates the geometries of the separate competent layers. At a basin-wide scale, the new model predicts that a compressive change of in-plane force results in basin center subsidence and flank uplift, confirming the original hypothesis. Compared to all previous models, the new model requires a lower horizontal stress level change to explain observed differential vertical motions.},

abstract = {Mesozoic granitoid rocks adjacent to the San Andreas fault in central California have retained their radiogenic Ar for the last 70 m.y. but have, generally, the highest 18O and H2O+ contents and the lowest D contents of all the granitoid rocks in California. The geographical coincidence of the D, 18O, and H2O+ patterns with the present trace of the San Andreas fault leave little doubt that some kind of groundwater circulation system has operated in the vicinity of the fault in central California. Similar isotopic patterns exist in rocks along the Garlock fault. These water-rock interactions probably took place at temperatures <200�C, although depth, extent, and timing are not resolved. Stable isotope compositions of rocks from many localities of the earth have provided unambiguous proof that meteoric waters have descended to depths at least as great as 8 to 10 km when a heat source such as a cooling pluton was present. Massive circulation of groundwater is common in the upper crust of tectonically active areas and may affect the frictional stress state along major faults. The geochemical evidence for extensive deep circulation of groundwater and the relatively high permeabilities for most rocks of the upper crust recently compiled by Brace (1980) argues against nearly lithostatic fluid pressures as an ambient condition of the upper crust. Groundwater circulation along the San Andreas provides an efficient mechanism for diffusing the heat flow anomaly that arises in heat transport calculations that are based on thermal conduction alone.},

abstract = {To date, research on neotectonics and related continental topography development has mostly focused on active plate boundaries characterized by generally high deformation rates. The intraplate sedimentary basins and rifts of the Northern Alpine foreland are associated with a much higher level of neotectonic activity than hitherto assumed. Seismicity and stress indicator data, combined with geodetic and geomorphologic observations, demonstrate that Europe's intraplate lithosphere is being actively deformed. This has major implications for the assessment of its natural hazards and environmental degradation. The lithosphere of the Northern Alpine foreland has undergone a polyphase evolution with an intense interplay between upper mantle thermal perturbations and stress-induced intraplate deformation that points to the importance of lithospheric folding of the thermally weakened lithosphere. In this paper, we address relationships between deeper lithospheric processes, neotectonics and surface processes in the Northern Alpine foreland with special emphasis on tectonically induced topography. The objectives are to quantify the effects of ongoing Alpine collision and Atlantic ridge-push on the intraplate deformation in Europe and its impact on topography evolution and related natural hazards.This paper reviews the four-dimensional topographic evolution of the European lithosphere through a multi-disciplinary approach linking geology, geophysics and geotechnology. Until now, research on neotectonics and related topography development of intraplate regions has received little attention. Our study examines a number of selected natural laboratories in continental Europe. From orogen through platform to continental margin, these natural laboratories include the Carpathians-Pannonian system, the Northwest European Platform, Iberia and the Atlantic continental margin.We focus on lithosphere memory and neotectonics with special attention to the thermo-mechanical structure of the lithosphere, mechanisms of large-scale intraplate deformation, Late-Neogene anomalies in subsidence and uplift, and links with surface processes and topography evolution.},

The calculations assume that the lithosphere consists of a three-dimensional layered elastic slab overlaying an inviscid fluid. The calculations show that the deviatoric stress difference induced by density heterogeneities and the topographic load is of the same order as the regional tectonic stress (tens of MPa). Stresses appear largest along the Saint Lawrence valley where most of the seismicity is located (e.g., the Charlevoix and the lower Saint Lawrence areas). The Charlevoix seismic zone was analyzed in greater detail and theoretical focal mechanisms were computed. This analysis shows that the stress induced by surface and internal loading is compressional in this area and the principal stress orientation is consistent with earthquake focal mechanisms and in-situ measurements.},

Zircon data provide evidence for widespread (hydro)thermal activity during the Permian and Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous. Apatite ages indicate a major cooling event in the mid Cretaceous (∼89–72 Ma) reflecting the time of inversion of the LSB. During the Cretaceous, the cooling of the basin centre was rapid compared to the basin margins.

Observed AHe cooling ages from equal elevation samples range between 1.5 and 8 Ma and suggest that thick alpine glaciers resulted in a 16 km shift of the highest point in the topography in the past 1.5-4.0 m.y. We evaluated temporal and spatial variations in erosion rates using a three-dimensional thermal-kinematic model that predicted AHe and AFT ages at the surface for different erosion histories. Comparison of model predicted and observed cooling ages suggests an increase in erosion rates of as much as 300% over the past 1.5-7 m.y., coincident with the onset of glaciation of this range.},

abstract = {Techniques for detection, evaluation, and prediction of pore pressures in low-permeability rocks and equations for fluid-pressure computations in most integrated basin-modeling software are based on relationships between porosity and effective stress in shales. However, recent data show that overpressured shales in the North Sea do not exhibit higher porosities than the normally pressured shales of the same formation at similar depths. To further evaluate the existence of porosity vs. effective stress relationships in shales, fluid-flow simulations and porosity modeling in a typical high-pressure and high-temperature well in the North Sea were undertaken. The parameters in the permeability and porosity equations were adjusted until a satisfactory fit was achieved between the observed and modeled porosity and fluid pressure at present. However, the modeled porosity and pore pressure vs. depth history of the sediments deviated significantly from known porosity and pore pressure vs. depth relationships that have been observed in North Sea shales and elsewhere today. Because the results from basin modeling based on porosity-stress relationships were unacceptable, irrespective of parameter choices, and the well data from the North Sea show no signs of elevated porosities in the overpressured shales, it is inferred that effective stress-driven compaction alone has not generated the hard overpressures observed in deeply buried North Sea shales. These conclusions are suggested to be generally applicable to shales with low porosities and hard overpressures worldwide, both because of the physics involved and because similar results can be extracted from published modeling in the Niger Delta.},

The asymmetric contact aureole, which extends nearly 6 m above and 4 m below the intrusion, contains the metamorphic minerals, diopside, pectolite, fluor-apophyllite, fluorite, and garnet. A series of coupled heat and mass transport calculations was undertaken to provide thermal constraints for the aureole, in the absence of robust geothermometric assemblages, and insights into accompanying mass transport associated with the sedimentary rock-dike system. Calculations were completed for systems with homogeneous, anisotropic, and layered permeability, [kappa]. Transport, dissolution, and precipitation of silica were also incorporated into calculations. All systems modeled indicate that the thermal pulse waned in 3 yr with a return to background temperatures in 10 yr. Heat and fluid transport produce maximum temperature isotherms that are distinctly different in spatial extent and lateral variability for each numerical system. The homogeneous [kappa] case produced isotherms that pinch and swell vertically above the dike and have large lateral variations, in contrast to the anisotropic [kappa] case that produced a single large plume above the dike. The layered system [kappa] case produced the most spatially extensive thermal aureole, unlike that recorded in the rocks. Addition of dissolved silica to the flow system significantly impacts the calculated transport of heat and fluid, primarily due to density changes that affect upwelling dynamics. Although precipitation and dissolution of SiO2 can affect flow through the feedback to permeability, [kappa] changes were found to be minor for these system conditions. Where [kappa] decreased, flow was refocused into higher [kappa] zones, thus mitigating the [kappa] differences over time. This negative feedback tends to defocus flow and provides a mechanism for lateral migration of plumes. Coupled heat and silica transport produces a complex isotherm geometry surrounding the intrusion due to formation of upwelling and downwelling plumes and lateral translation of plumes, leading to variability in the isotherm pattern that does not reflect the inherent heterogeneity of the initial material properties. Initial heterogeneities in [kappa] are not a prerequisite for the development of a complicated flow and transport pattern. In addition, if isotherms reflect isograds, these calculations demonstrate that isograds may not form uniform structures with isograd boundaries characterized by their distance from the heat source.},

abstract = {The Roer valley rift system (RVRS) is located in the northern prolongation of the upper Rhine Graben. During the Cenozoic, the evolution of the RVRS was influenced by two different rift systems situated in the North and in the South (the North Sea rift system and the West European rift system, respectively). During the last decades, moderate seismicity revealed the continuous activity of the graben border faults (the Peel Boundary fault zone -PBFZ- and the Feldbiss fault zone-FFZ-). We use a high precision digital elevation model (DEM) to characterize and quantify the present-day deformation along these faults. The fault pattern shows similarity to a strike-slip structure. However, analysis of the DEM reveals that the Recent to Quaternary formations and landforms affected by the fault activity are only vertically offset. This suggests a pure normal faulting mode for the main border faults and a direction of extension perpendicular to the graben (i.e., NE-SW). Quantification of the offset dated markers allows the determination of the displacement rates along the fault segments. In the southeastern part of the RVRS, the vertical displacement rates inferred for the FFZ and the southeastern PBFZ range between 55 and 65 mm/ky and around 65 mm/ky, respectively. In contrast, the displacement rates determined for the northwestern segment of the PBFZ are around 200 mm/ky. We explain these differences between the northwestern and southeastern parts of the RVRS by the large-scale geometry of the graben, the RVRS being symmetric in the south-east and asymmetric (half-graben) in the north-west. The deformation is accommodated by two border faults (FFZ and the south-eastern part of the PBFZ) in the south-east and by only one fault in the north-west (the north-western segment of the PBFZ). In addition, the thickness of the Neogene main depocentre in the northwestern half of the RVRS indicates a larger amount of extension in this part of the graben than in the south-east. The combination of the graben geometry and the amount of extension can explain the differences in the displacement rate.},

@article{Underhill1993,
abstract = {Although the ‘Mid-Cimmerian event' or unconformity has been recognized over much of Europe, its exact stratigraphic relations and causal mechanism have remained unclear. Application of a genetic sequence stratigraphic approach (using 17 marine condensed sections and maximum flooding surfaces) to Jurassic sequences across NW Europe allows the stratigraphic succession to be subdivided into a series of time-slices (genetic stratigraphic sequences) and allows the true nature of the unconformity to be determined. They indicate that the main event's correlative conformity falls in the Aalenian near the break between the  and  ammonite biochronozones. Further study of the associated spatial and temporal variation indicates that systematic truncation of stratigraphy occurred throughout the North Sea domain (the oldest stratigraphies subcrop in areas adjacent to the triple junction) with subsequent progressive onlap towards the same area. When integrated with igneous evidence, these observations are interpreted to confirm regional (Toarcian–Aalenian) domal uplift, resulting from the impingement of a broad-based (> 1250 km diameter), transient plume head or ‘blob' at the base of the lithosphere. Progressive pre-rift, Aalenian–early Bathonian marine onlap records differential subsidence in response to the initial deflation of the dome while central regions may have continued to rise. Subsequent subsidence post-dated Bathonian–Callovian volcanism but still pre-dated the timing of most significant (Kimmeridgian–Volgian) rif},

abstract = {Forward reconstructions of the (mainly) Mesozoic and younger rheological evolution have been made for four basins (Broad Fourteens Basin, Sole Pit Basin, Brittany Basin and the Iberian Basin) in a very consistent way by backstripping and automatic forward modeling of subsidence data, including potentially important effects of heat production, sediment infill and sedimentary blanketing. For default compositional and thermal parameters, the modeling results show strengthening in all basins, and in particular during inversion, with strength increases up to about 2 TN m−1 (20%) relative to their initial values. Given predominantly relatively constant intraplate stresses in continental lithosphere, this is in disagreement with repeated localization of basin deformation. In a thorough sensitivity analysis we explore the possibilities that permissible variations in tectonic history, compositional, rheological and thermal parameters can, in a particular combination, result in slight weakening of the basin, in agreement with reactivation during inversion. However, such a combination reflects an extreme scenario, which is not founded by geological evidence and, statistically, is very unlikely to apply for all basins. A far more likely explanation for relative and permanent weakening of the basins is the presence of pre-existing weak zones, deviating from standard rheological assumptions. At (upper) crustal levels, weakening can be attributed to pre-existing marked faults by a reduced friction angle. This weakening has a pronounced influence on lithospheric strength provided that the reduction in friction angle of pre-existing faults can be extrapolated to the upper mantle. Alternatively, weakening of the upper mantle can be attributed to (1) ductile localization mechanisms, as reflected by the occurrence of upper mantle shear zones, or (2) the occurrence of rheologically weak material, as indicated by upper mantle reflectors.},

abstract = {We present a two-layered finite difference model for the flexural response of the lithosphere to extensional faulting. The model allows for three modes of flexure: (1) fully coupled, with the upper crust and mantle welded together by the lower crust; (2) fully decoupled, with the upper crust and mantle behaving as independent layers; and (3) partly decoupled, signifying that the response of the upper crust to small-wavelength loads is superimposed on the response of the entire lithosphere to long-wavelength loads. Which of these modes of flexure is to be expected depends on the rheology and especially the thermal state of the lithosphere. Coupled behaviour is related to a cold and strong lithosphere. The Baikal Rift Zone provides a typical example for this mode of flexure. A fully decoupled lithosphere is an exceptional case, related to anomalous high temperatures in the lower crust, and is observed in the Basin and Range province. The most common case is a partly decoupled lithosphere, with the degree of decoupling depending on the thickness and viscosity of the lower crust. This is inferred, for example, for the Bay of Biscay margin.},

@article{Haghighi2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Despite many efforts to develop evapotranspiration (ET) models with improved parametrizations of resistance terms for water vapor transfer into the atmosphere, estimates of ET and its partitioning remain prone to bias. Much of this bias could arise from inadequate representations of physical interactions near nonuniform surfaces from which localized heat and water vapor fluxes emanate. This study aims to provide a mechanistic bridge from land-surface characteristics to vertical transport predictions, and proposes a new physically based ET model that builds on a recently developed bluff-rough bare soil evaporation model incorporating coupled soil moisture-atmospheric controls. The newly developed ET model explicitly accounts for (1) near-surface turbulent interactions affecting soil drying and (2) soil-moisture-dependent stomatal responses to atmospheric evaporative demand that influence leaf (and canopy) transpiration. Model estimates of ET and its partitioning were in good agreement with available field-scale data, and highlight hidden processes not accounted for by commonly used ET schemes. One such process, nonlinear vegetation-induced turbulence (as a function of vegetation stature and cover fraction) significantly influences ET-soil moisture relationships. Our results are particularly important for water resources and land use planning of semiarid sparsely vegetated ecosystems where soil surface interactions are known to play a critical role in land-climate interactions. This study potentially facilitates a mathematically tractable description of the strength (i.e., the slope) of the ET-soil moisture relationship, which is a core component of models that seek to predict land-atmosphere coupling and its feedback to the climate system in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition, diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental consequences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 1) approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing; 2) increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N-2O globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth; 3) caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility; 4) contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; and 5) greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 6) increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems; 7) accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; and 8) caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

Fault reactivation is caused by three factors: (1) a recent increase in the compressional stress in the area associated with postglacial rebound, (2) locally elevated pore pressure due to the pres- ence of natural gas in a hydrocarbon reservoir on the footwall side of the fault, and (3) a fault orientation that is nearly optimally oriented for frictional slip in the present-day stress field. We demonstrate that the combination of these three factors induces fault slippage and gas leakage along sections of the previously sealing reservoir-bounding fault. We argue that similar pore- pressure triggering of fault slip in the crust may occur because of the accumulation of gas columns of, e.g., CO2 and He in the vicinity of tectonic faults.},

abstract = {Apatite fission-track analyses were carried out on outcrop and core samples from the Rhenish massif and the Carboniferous Ruhr Basin/Germany in order to study the late- and post-Variscan thermal and exhumation history. Apatite fission-track ages range from 291±15 Ma (lower Permian) to 136±7 Ma (lower Cretaceous) and mean track lengths vary between 11.6 µm and 13.9 µm, mostly displaying unimodal distributions with narrow standard deviations. All apatite fission-track ages are younger than the corresponding sample stratigraphic age, indicating substantial post-depositional annealing of the apatite fission-tracks. This agrees with results from maturity modelling, which indicates 3500–7000 m eroded Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary cover. Numerical modelling of apatite fission-track data predicts onset of exhumation and cooling not earlier than 320 Ma in the Rhenish massif and 300 Ma in the Ruhr Basin, generally followed by late Carboniferous–Triassic cooling to below 50–60°C. Rapid late Variscan cooling was followed by moderate Mesozoic cooling rates of 0.1–0.2°C/Ma, converting into denudation rates of \textless1 mm/a (assuming a stable geothermal gradient of 30°C/km). Modelling results also give evidence for some late Triassic and early Jurassic heating and/or burial, which is supported by sedimentary rocks of the same age preserved at the rim of the lower Rhine Basin and in the subsurface of the Central and Northern Ruhr Basin. Cenozoic exhumation and cooling of the Rhenish massif is interpreted as an isostatic response to former erosion and major base-level fall caused by the subsidence in the lower Rhine Basin.},

abstract = {The relationship between fracturing and fracture filling in opening-mode fractures in the Triassic Buntsandstein in the Lower Saxony Basin (LSB; NW Germany) has been studied by an integration of petrographic and structural analysis of core samples, strontium isotope analysis and microthermometry on fluid inclusions. This revealed the relationship between the timing of the fracturing and the precipitation of different mineral phases in the fractures by constraining the precipitation conditions and considering the possible fluid transport mechanisms. The core was studied from four different boreholes, located in different structural settings across the LSB. In the core samples from the four boreholes, fractures filled with calcite, quartz and anhydrite were found, in addition to pore-filling calcite cementation. In boreholes 2 and 3, calcite-filled fractures have a fibrous microstructure whereas in borehole 1, fractures are filled with elongate-blocky calcite crystals. Anhydrite-filled fractures have, in all samples, a blocky to elongate-blocky microstructure. Fractures that are filled with quartz are observed in borehole 2 only where the quartz crystals are 'stretched' with an elongated habit. Fluid inclusion microthermometry of fracturing-filling quartz crystals showed that quartz precipitation took place at temperatures of at least 140�C, from a fluid with NaCl2013CaCl22013H2O composition. Melting phases are meta-stable and suggest growth from high salinity formation water. Strontium isotopes, measured in leached host rock, indicate that, in boreholes 2 and 3, the fluid which precipitated the calcite cements and calcite-filled fractures is most likely locally derived whereas in borehole 1, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios from the pore-filling cements and in the elongate-blocky calcite-filled fracture can only be explained by mixing with externally derived fluids. The elongate-blocky anhydrite-filled fractures, present in boreholes 1, 3 and 4, precipitated from a mixture of locally derived pore fluids and a significant quantity of fluid with a lower, less radiogenic, 87Sr/86Sr ratio. Taking into account the structural evolution of the basin and accompanying salt tectonics, it is likely that the underlying Zechstein is a source for the less radiogenic fluids. Based on the samples in the LSB, it is probable that fibrous fracture fillings in sedimentary rocks most likely developed from locally derived pore fluids whereas elongate-blocky fracture fillings with smooth walls developed from externally derived pore fluids.},

abstract = {We evaluated the magnitude and composition (in terms of salinity, 223Ra and 224Ra activity, and nutrient concentrations) of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) fluxes at 11 sites on the Kona coast of Hawaii. Discharging groundwater was typically brackish to saline and had high Ra activity relative to ocean water and fresher, inland groundwater. Brackish SGD fluxes, estimated using a mass-balance approach based on excess coastal ocean 224Ra activity, ranged from 3 to 1300 L m−1 of coastline min−1. Fluxes of the freshwater component of SGD, calculated based on salinity, ranged from 2 to 310 L m−1 min−1. Nutrient fluxes into coastal waters from SGD varied by up to three orders of magnitude among sites. Nitrate + nitrite (N + N), phosphate, and silica concentrations showed strong, inverse linear correlations with salinity in coastal seawater and groundwater. These correlations were consistent with previous work that documented conservative mixing between fresh, high-nutrient groundwater and saline, low-nutrient seawater at a few coastal ocean sites. We extend this conservative relationship to more coastal ocean sites and to groundwater in the coastal aquifer. N + N concentrations in the fresh component of discharging groundwater were higher at sites near golf courses and those with a greater percentage of bare land within a 5-km radius, and silica concentrations in the fresh component of discharging groundwater were higher at sites with more bare land and lower population densities. However, neither urbanization nor agriculture was significantly correlated with groundwater nutrient concentrations on this relatively undeveloped coast.},

abstract = {A majority of the global net primary production of mangroves is unaccounted for by current carbon budgets. It has been hypothesized that this “missing carbon” is exported as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from subsurface respiration and groundwater (or pore-water) exchange driven by tidal pumping. We tested this hypothesis by measuring concentrations and $\delta$13C values of DIC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC), along with radon (222Rn, a natural submarine groundwater discharge tracer), in a tidal creek in Moreton Bay, Australia. Concentrations and $\delta$13C values displayed consistent tidal variations, and mirrored the trend in 222Rn in summer and winter. DIC and DOC were exported from, and POC was imported to, the mangroves during all tidal cycles. The exported DOC had a similar $\delta$13C value in summer and winter (∼ −30‰). The exported $\delta$13C-DIC showed no difference between summer and winter and had a $\delta$13C value slightly more enriched (∼ −22.5‰) than the exported DOC. The imported POC had differing values in summer (∼ −16‰) and winter (∼ −22‰), reflecting a combination of seagrass and estuarine particulate organic matter (POM) in summer and most likely a dominance of estuarine POM in winter. A coupled 222Rn and carbon model showed that 93–99% of the DIC and 89–92% of the DOC exports were driven by groundwater advection. DIC export averaged 3 g C m−2 d−1 and was an order of magnitude higher than DOC export, and similar to global estimates of the mangrove missing carbon (i.e., ∼ 1.9–2.7 g C m−2 d−1).},

abstract = {The main aim of this project is the preparation of a specific data base of geothermal properties for typi- cal rocks of the Swiss Molasse Basin (depth interval 0- 500 m). The project includes the development of a new laboratory tool for efficient heat capacity measurements on rock samples, numerous new meas- urements of geothermal rock properties in the laboratory and calculation of such data from geophysical borehole logs. Within the study area (Fig. 1) 282 rock samples, mainly from deep boreholes, were analyzed with the successfully calibrated new heat capacity device and conventional thermal conductivity measuring tech- niques (cuttings and cores). Based on sonic and density log data from exploration wells, 374 additional data points were generated. This new data base (Appendix 4, upgraded and revised in 2006) characterizes in detail the six main lithological rock types in the three Molasse groups OSM, OMM and USM within the Swiss Plateau Mo- lasse. The statistical evaluation of all data illustrates the regional variation of the petrophysical and geo- thermal parameters. Bulk rock density and thermal conductivity increase, whereas heat capacity de- creases in the direction towards the Alpine front for most data groups (Appendix 5). Thermal conductiv- ity shows a distinct increase with depth. Based on this new information and with the aid of the evaluation software tool SwEWS (Leu et al. 2006), the costs of planned geothermal installations can be optimized by more precise heat extraction simula- tions with existing software packages like COSOND, TRNSYS, EWS or WPcalc.},

In developing countries, limited budgets and scarce hydrological data often do not allow groundwater resources to be assessed through groundwater modeling. A case study is presented of a low-cost water-balance approach to groundwater resource assessments in a 1,550 km2 semi-arid region in northwestern Syria. The past development of irrigated agriculture and its effect on the groundwater system were studied by analysis of Landsat images and long-term groundwater level changes, respectively. All components of the groundwater balance were determined. Groundwater recharge was estimated using the chloride mass balance method. Over the past three decades, groundwater levels have declined, on average, 23 m, coinciding with a two-fold increase in the groundwater-irrigated area. Groundwater resources are currently depleted by a value that lies between 9.5×106 and 118×106 m3 year−1, which is larger than can be compensated for by a future decrease in natural discharge or changes in boundary conditions. However, groundwater resources are likely to be sufficient to supply domestic and livestock needs in the area.},

However, this assumption has not been widely tested and in some cases has been found to be in error. An analysis of ground water rise in regional unconfined aquifers, using both a two?dimensional boundary element model and a one?dimensional Dupuit?Forchheimer model, reveals the conditions under which the water table does or does not closely follow the topography. A simple decision criterion is presented to estimate in advance under which conditions the water table is expected to be largely unrelated to the topography and under which conditions the topography controls the position of the water table.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 942013113 The petroleum industry uses subsurface flow models for two principal purposes: to model the flow of hydrocarbons into traps over geological time, and to simulate the production of hydrocarbon from reservoirs over periods of decades or less. Faults, which are three-dimensional volumes, are approximated in both modelling applications as planar membranes onto which predictions of the most important fault-related flow properties are mapped. Faults in porous clastic reservoirs are generally baffles or barriers to flow and the relevant flow properties are therefore very different to those which are important in conductive fracture flow systems. A critical review and discussion is offered on the work-flows used to predict and model capillary threshold pressure for exploration fault seal analysis and fault transmissibility multipliers for production simulation, and of the data from which the predictions derive. New flow simulation models confirm that failure of intra-reservoir sealing faults can occur during a reservoir depressurization via a water-drive mechanism, but contrary to anecdotal reports, published examples of production-induced seal failure are elusive. Ignoring the three-dimensional structure of fault zones can sometimes have a significant influence on production-related flow, and a series of models illustrating flow associated with relay zones are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. This study presents a new approach to geobarometry by combining fluid inclusion and clumped isotope ($\Delta$ 47 ) thermometry on carbonate minerals. The offset between homogenisation temperatures of primary fluid inclusions with known composition and $\Delta$ 47 temperatures of the host mineral allows a direct estimation of the fluid pressure at the time of carbonate crystallisation. This new approach is illustrated via hydrothermal dolomite samples from the Variscan foreland fold-and-thrust belt in northern Spain. Clumped isotope analyses yield crystallisation temperatures (107-168°C) which are higher than homogenisation temperatures in corresponding samples (95-145°C). The calculated pressure values suggest that dolomitizing fluids were overpressured during formation of zebra dolomite textures, whereas lower pressures are obtained for dolomite cement from breccia textures. This new approach to geobarometry opens up the possibility of estimating the pressure of carbonate crystallisation and has potential applications in diagenesis, basin analysis, ore geology and tectonics.},

abstract = {More than half of the surface sediments covering the continental shelves are sandy, which may permit substantial sub-seafloor pore water advection. Knowledge of sediment permeability is required for quantifying advection and associated solute transport, but studies of marine sediments typically report grain size analyses rather than permeability. Here data from 23 studies were examined to determine the range in permeabilities reported for sublittoral marine sands and to assess the utility of permeability–grain size relationships in this setting. In the resulting database, the permeability of small (∼30 cm) undisturbed cores collected from the sea floor all fell between 2 × 10−12 and 4 × 10−10 m2, a range where advective transport induced by wave and current action should be pervasive. The range in grain size was very similar for near-shore (<10 m water depth) and continental shelf samples (>10 m water depth), but the permeability of the continental shelf samples was consistently lower for the same median grain size. Empirical permeability–grain size relationships generated a poor fit (r2 = 0.35) for the aggregate data, but separate relationships for near-shore and continental shelf samples were significantly better, r2 = 0.66 and 0.77, respectively. Permeability–grain size relationships thus may be useful for sublittoral sands, but a larger database needs to be accumulated before reliable fit parameters and variability can be predicted. Thus it is recommended that permeability be routinely determined when characterizing sedimentological properties of marine sand deposits. Concurrent determinations of sediment bulk density and porosity may further improve estimates of permeability.},

Results showed a strong influence of sewage-derived N in nearshore waters, with $\delta$15N values varying as a function of species sampled, site, and sampling date. Increases in sewage-derived N correlated significantly with increases in the severity of disease among Porites spp., with $\delta$15N values accounting for more than 48% of the variation in changes in disease severity. The anticipated military realignment and related population increase in Guam are expected to lead to increased white syndrome infections and other coral diseases.},

The new data give a mean surface heat flow for Victoria of 71 ± 15 mW m- 2 which fits within the 61–77 mW m- 2 range reported for Phanerozoic-aged crust globally. These data reveal three new thermally and compositionally distinct heat flow sub-provinces within the previously defined Eastern Heat Flow Province: the Delamerian heat flow sub-province (average surface heat flow 60 ± 9 mW m- 2); the Lachlan heat flow sub-province (average surface heat flow 74 ± 13 mW m- 2); and the Newer Volcanics heat flow sub-province (average surface heat flow 72 ± 16 mW m- 2) which includes extreme values that locally exceed 100 mW m- 2. Inversions of reduced heat flow and crustal differentiation find that the Delamerian sub-province has experienced significant crustal reworking compared to the Lachlan and Newer Volcanics sub-provinces. The latter has experienced volcanism within the last 8 Ma and the degree of variability observed in surface heat flow points (up to 8 mW m- 2 per kilometre laterally) cannot be replicated with steady-state thermal models through this sub-province. In the absence of a strong palaeoclimate signal, aquifer disturbances, or highly enriched granites, we suggest that this high variability arises from localised transient perturbations to the upper crust associated with recent intraplate volcanism. This is supported by a strong spatial correlation of high surface heat flow and known eruption points within the Newer Volcanics heat flow sub-province.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Surface water, groundwater, and groundwater discharge quality surveys were conducted in Cherrystone Inlet, on Virginia's Eastern Shore. Shallow groundwater below agricultural fields had nitrate concentrations significantly higher than inlet surface waters and shallow groundwater underlying forested land. This elevated nitrate groundwater discharged to adjacent surface waters. Nearshore discharge rates of water across the sediment-water interface ranged from 0.02 to 3.69 liters{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}hr−1 during the surveys. The discharge was greatest nearshore at low tide periods, and decreased markedly with increasing distance offshore. Vertical hydraulic heads, Eh, and inorganic nitrogen flux in the sediments followed similar patterns. Nitrate was the predominant nitrogen species discharged nearshore adjacent to agricultural land use, changing to ammonium farther offshore. Sediment nitrogen fluxes were sufficient to cause observable impacts on surface water quality; nitrate concentrations were up to 20 times greater in areas of groundwater discharge than in the main stem inlet water. Based on DIN:DIP ratios, nitrogen contributions from direct groundwater discharge and tidal creek inputs appear to be of significant ecological importance. This groundwater discharge links land use activity and the quality of surface water, and therefore must be considered in selection of best management practices and water quality management strategies.},

abstract = {Geofluids (2010) 10, 20201340 We present a thermodynamic model for mineral dissolution in aqueous fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures, based on intrinsic thermal properties and variations of volumetric properties of the aqueous solvent. The standard thermodynamic properties of mineral dissolution into aqueous fluid consist of two contributions: one from the energy of transformation from the solid to the hydrated-species state and the other from the compression of solvent molecules during the formation of a hydration shell. The latter contribution has the dimension of the generalized Krichevskii parameter. This approach describes the energetics of solvation more accurately than does the Born electrostatic theory and can be extended beyond the limits of experimental measurements of the dielectric constant of H2O. The new model has been calibrated by experimental solubilities of quartz, corundum, rutile, calcite, apatite, fluorite and portlandite in pure H2O at temperatures up to 1100�C and pressures up to 20�kbar. All minerals show a steady increase in solubility along constant geothermal gradients or water isochores. By contrast, isobaric solubilities initially increase with rising temperature but then decline above 2002013400�C. This retrograde behavior is caused by variations in the isobaric expansivity of the aqueous solvent, which approaches infinity at its critical point. Oxide minerals predominantly dissolve to neutral species; so, their dissolution energetics involve a relatively small contribution from the solvent volumetric properties and their retrograde solubilities are restricted to a relatively narrow window of temperature and pressure near the critical point of water. By contrast, Ca-bearing minerals dissolve to a variety of charged species; so, the energetics of their dissolution reactions involve a comparatively large contribution from volume changes of the aqueous solvent and their isobaric retrograde solubility spans nearly all metamorphic and magmatic conditions. These features correlate with and can be predicted from the standard partial molar volumes of aqueous species. The thermodynamic model can be used over much wider range of settings for terrestrial fluid2013rock interaction than has previously been possible. To illustrate, it is integrated with transport theory to show quantitatively that integrated fluid fluxes characteristic of crustal shear zones are capable of precipitating quartz or calcite veins from low- and medium-grade metamorphic conditions, at a geothermal gradient of 20�C�km22121. For subduction zones, modeled by a geotherm of 7�C�km22121, the required fluid fluxes are one to two orders of magnitude lower and predict enhanced efficiency of mass transfer and metasomatic precipitation in comparison with orogenic settings. The new model thus can be applied to shallow hydrothermal, metamorphic, magmatic and subduction fluids, and for retrieval of dependent thermodynamic properties for mass transfer or geodynamic modeling.},

abstract = {Chemical and isotopic data for groundwater from throughout the Middle Rio Grande Basin, central New Mexico, USA, were used to identify and map groundwater flow from 12 sources of water to the basin, evaluate radiocarbon ages, and refine the conceptual model of the Santa Fe Group aquifer system. Hydrochemical zones, representing groundwater flow over thousands to tens of thousands of years, can be traced over large distances through the primarily siliciclastic aquifer system. The locations of the hydrochemical zones mostly reflect the “modern” predevelopment hydraulic-head distribution, but are inconsistent with a trough in predevelopment water levels in the west-central part of the basin, indicating that this trough is a transient rather than a long-term feature of the aquifer system. Radiocarbon ages adjusted for geochemical reactions, mixing, and evapotranspiration/dilution processes in the aquifer system were nearly identical to the unadjusted radiocarbon ages, and ranged from modern to more than 30 ka. Age gradients from piezometer nests ranged from 0.1 to 2 year cm –1 and indicate a recharge rate of about 3 cm year –1 for recharge along the eastern mountain front and infiltration from the Rio Grande near Albuquerque. There has been appreciably less recharge along the eastern mountain front north and south of Albuquerque.},

abstract = {A complete Alpine cross section integrates numerous seismic reflection and refraction profiles, across and along strike, with published and new field data. The deepest parts of the profile are constrained by geophysical data only, while structural features at intermediate levels are largely depicted according to the results of three-dimensional models making use of seismic and field geological data. The geometry of the highest structural levels is constrained by classical along-strike projections of field data parallel to the pronounced easterly axial dip of all tectonic units. Because the transect is placed close to the western erosional margin of the Austroalpine nappes of the Eastern Alps, it contains all the major tectonic units of the Alps. A model for the tectonic evolution along the transect is proposed in the form of scaled and area-balanced profile sketches. Shortening within the Austroalpine nappes is testimony of a separate Cretaceous-age orogenic event. West directed thrusting in these units is related to westward propagation of a thrust wedge resulting from continental collision along the Meliata-Hallstatt Ocean further to the east. Considerable amounts of oceanic and continental crustal material were subducted during Tertiary orogeny, which involved some 500 km of N{\^{a}}€“S convergence between Europe and Apulia. Consequently, only a very small percentage of this crustal material is preserved within the nappes depicted in the transect. Postcollisional shortening is characterized by the simultaneous activity of gently dipping north directed detachments and steeply inclined south directed detachments, both detachments nucleating at the interface between lower and upper crust. Large scale wedging of the Adriatic (or Apulian) lower crust into a gap opening between the subduced European lower crust and the pile of thin upper crustal flakes (Alpine nappes) indicates a relatively strong lower crust and detachment between upper and lower crust.},

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important source of dissolved elements to the ocean, yet little is known regarding the chemical reactions that control their flux from sandy coastal aquifers. The net flux of elements from SGD to the coastal ocean is dependent on biogeochemical reactions in the groundwater–seawater mixing zone, recently termed the “subterranean estuary.” This paper is the second in a two part series on the biogeochemistry of the Waquoit Bay coastal aquifer/subterranean estuary. The first paper addressed the biogeochemistry of Fe, Mn, P, Ba, U, and Th from the perspective of the sediment composition of cores Charette et al. [Charette, M.A., Sholkovitz, E.R., Hansell, C.M., 2005. Trace element cycling in a subterranean estuary: Part 1. Geochemistry of the permeable sediments. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 69, 2095–2109]. This paper uses pore water data from the subterranean estuary, along with Bay surface water data, to establish a more detailed view into the estuarine chemistry and the chemical diagenesis of Fe, Mn, U, Ba and Sr in coastal aquifers. Nine high-resolution pore water (groundwater) profiles were collected from the head of the Bay during July 2002. There were non-conservative additions of both Ba and Sr in the salinity transition zone of the subterranean estuary. However, the extent of Sr release was significantly less than that of its alkaline earth neighbor Ba. Pore water Ba concentrations approached 3000nM compared with 25–50nM in the surface waters of the Bay; the pore water Sr-salinity distribution suggests a 26% elevation in the amount of Sr added to the subterranean estuary. The release of dissolved Ba to the mixing zone of surface estuaries is frequently attributed to an ion-exchange process whereby seawater cations react with Ba from river suspended clay mineral particles at low to intermediate salinity. Results presented here suggest that reductive dissolution of Mn oxides, in conjunction with changes in salinity, may also be an important process in maintaining high concentrations of Ba in the pore water of subterranean estuaries. In contrast, pore water U was significantly depleted in the subterranean estuary, a result of SGD-driven circulation of seawater through reducing permeable sediments. This finding is supported by surface water concentrations of U in the Bay, which were significantly depleted in U compared with adjacent coastal waters. Using a global estimate of SGD, we calculate U removal in subterranean estuaries at 20×106molUy−1, which is the same order of magnitude as the other major U sinks for the ocean. Our results suggest a need to revisit and reevaluate the oceanic budgets for elements that are likely influenced by SGD-associated processes.},

@article{Byerlee1993,
abstract = {In this model for the evolution of large crustal faults, water that originally came from the country rock saturates the initially highly porous and permeable fault zone. During shearing, the fault zone compacts and water flows back into the country rock, but the flow is arrested by silicate deposition that forms very low permeability seals between the fault zone and the country rock. Because of variations in temperature and mineralogical composition and the complex structure of the fault zone, a three-dimensional network of seals is formed in the fault zone itself; thus, the high-pressure fluid is not evenly distributed. As in deep oil reservoirs, the fluid will be confined to seal-bounded fluid compartments of various sizes and porosity that are not hydraulically connected with each other or with the hydrostatic regime in the country rock. When the seal between two of these compartments is ruptured, an electrical streaming potential will be generated by the sudden movement of fluid from the high-pressure compartment to the low-pressure compartment. When the pore pressure in the two compartments reaches its final equilibrium state, the average effective normal stress across them may be lower than it was initially, and, if the two compartments are large enough, this condition may trigger an earthquake. During an earthquake, many of the remaining seals will be ruptured, and the width of the fault zone will increase by failure of the geometric irregularities on the fault. This newly created, highly porous and permeable, but now wider fault zone will fill with water, and the process described above will be repeated. Thus, the process is an episodic one, with the water moving in and out of the fault zone, and each large earthquake should be preceded by an electrical and/or magnetic signal.},

abstract = {The partitioning of available energy into dissipative fluxes over land surfaces is dependent on the state variable of the surface energy balance (land surface temperature) and the state variable of the surface water balance (soil moisture). The direct measurement of the turbulent fluxes is achieved with in situ instruments at tower sites. These point-scale measurements are sparsely distributed. Broader scale mapping of the turbulent fluxes is mostly dependent on land surface temperature (LST) and optical/infrared vegetation that can be sensed remotely. There are several data assimilation approaches currently in use that intake sequences of daytime LST that attain different diurnal amplitudes depending on available energy and the relative efficiency of surface energy balance to infer the magnitude of surface flux components such as latent and sensible heat flux. In this study we perform stability analysis on the evolution of LST in order to provide insights into the physical bases for why LST variations can be used to diagnose surface energy balance (SEB) components. The derived relative efficiencies of SEB components in dissipating available energy at the land surface are tested using two field experiment measurements. The results show that the theoretically derived relative efficiencies of SEB components agree well with field observations. The study provides insight into how LST sequences implicitly contain the signature of partitioning of available energy among SEB components and can be used to infer their magnitudes.},

annote = {Confined fission-track lengths have been used to study the degree of annealing of induced fission tracks in samples of a single fluorapatite crystal (Durango apatite), heated for various times (between 20 min. and 500 days) at temperatures between 95� and 400�C. In all annealed samples the mean confined track length is always less than that in unannealed control samples. As annealing progresses, the mean length is reduced and the length distribution broadens, slowly at first, and then more rapidly below a length reduction (l/l0) of \textasciitilde 0.65. In addition, the variation of track length with angle to the crystallographic c-axis becomes progressively more anisotropic. As the mean track length approaches zero, the only tracks left are aligned parallel to the c-acis. In heavily annealed samples (l/l0 \textless 0.65) observation of individual tracks after sequential etching steps shows the presence of unetchable "gaps" in a small proportion of tracks. The existence of these gaps is borne out by annealing studies of heavy-ion tracks in apatite slices. These studies also show the anisotropy characteristic of annealing in apatite. The annealing of fission tracks in apatite appears to be characterised by two processes. For small degrees of annealing the dominant process brings about a progressive shrinking of the track from each end, with tracks perpendicular to the c-axis shortening more rapidly than those parallel to it. As annealing becomes more severe (l/l0 \textless 0.65) the tracks begin to break up into discontinuous portions. Track length distributions in annealed apatites reflect the interplay of these processes. The effect of apatite composition on annealing has been studied using spontaneous tracks in apatites from a sample in which considerable geological annealing has occurred. Electron microprobe studies show that apatite grains rich in Cl are more resistant to annealing, while fluorapatite is more readily annealed.},

We here present mathematical calculations indicating that uncommonly high permeability contrasts and/or exceptionally high band concentrations are required for deformation bands to significantly affect production rate. We also present field observations showing rapid variations in porosity and permeability along deformation bands and deformation-band zones alike. Furthermore, many paleofluid fronts seen in the field are unaffected or only gently affected by deformation bands. Together, these calculations and observations suggest that their function during reservoir production is small or negligible in most cases. Structural complications caused by subseismic faulting and complex fault anatomy are more likely to cause production problems, in addition to stratigraphic and diagenetic effects. Nevertheless, the arrangement and orientation of deformation bands may have an effect on the flow pattern and reservoir sweep. In cases where deformation bands do cause production problems, it may be possible to resolve these by means of hydraulic fracturing.},

abstract = {Thermal histories derived from apatite fission-track data are remarkably consistent irrespective of tectonic setting and overall rate of cooling. Rapid cooling through the partial annealing zone is typically followed by slower cooling, and such histories can only be explained by systematic errors in the experimentally derived annealing rates used to determine the thermal histories, or a consistent geotherm shape characterized by a relatively low geothermal gradient in the uppermost crust. Differences between the cooling paths characterizing individual tectonic settings indicate that geotherm shape influences the cooling histories. This suggests that crustal geotherms, especially those in orogenic belts, are characterized by a shallow zone of high permeability, allowing the rapid transfer of heat by fluid advection, perhaps together with a near-surface zone affected by enhanced heat loss due to topographic effects. The influence of such controls on cooling histories must be considered prior to using thermochronology data to constrain denudation histories.},

abstract = {We present stratigraphic modeling and quantitative analysis of the Pliocene and Quaternary subsidence of the southern North Sea basin. During the Late Pliocene, well before the onset of Quaternary glaciation, the subsidence rate in the southern part of the North Sea basin showed a ten-fold increase relative to previous Tertiary rates. The high Pliocene-Quaternary subsidence rate is consistent with the direction and state of the present intraplate stress field in Northwest Europe. One possible consequence of the modern compressional stress field in Northwest Europe is reactivation of faulting in the Central Graben resulting in localized stretching and the development of pull-apart basins. Alternatively, the acceleration in Late Pliocene subsidence rates could be due to localized flexural downwarping of the lithosphere in the Central Graben caused by an increase in the level of intraplate compression. Both mechanisms succesfully predict the major characteristics of the overall Quaternary subsidence history and stratigraphy. Gravity modeling suggests that the mechanism of localized stretching dominates the recent tectonostratigraphic evolution of the southern North Sea.},

abstract = {Abstract The fresh component of submarine groundwater discharge (fresh SGD) transports nutrient and contaminant loads from the land to sea. Fresh SGD fluxes are poorly known but depend on geology, topography, climate, and land use. Here, we assess two general approaches for quantifying the magnitude of fresh SGD over regional to continental scales—water budgets (lumped parameter models) and groundwater flow models—focusing on the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts as a large‐scale case study. Estimates of fresh SGD fluxes from groundwater flow models are more variable than estimates from water budgets, and both are often less than field‐based estimates. Both approaches predict the volume of fresh SGD within approximately 50% of 12.3 km3/y, in line with previous estimates, and differences are largely driven by hydrographic data inputs. The simplified water budget approach, while computationally cheap, cannot resolve flow paths or continuous flux distributions and may neglect groundwater flow from deep aquifers or distal recharge zones. Conversely, three‐dimensional groundwater flow models can resolve flow paths and fresh SGD contributions from heterogeneous aquifer systems but are computationally expensive and require more parameterization. Ultimately, multiple models and integrated field data are needed to improve our estimates of fresh SGD fluxes over a wide range of scales.},

abstract = {High-precision stepped-heating experiments were performed to better characterize helium diffusion from apatite using Durango fluorapatite as a model system. At temperatures below 265{\o}C, helium diffusion from this apatite is a simple, thermally activated process that is independent of the cumulative fraction of helium released and also of the heating schedule used. Across a factor of -4 in grain size, helium diffusivity scales with the inverse square of grain radius, implying that the physical grain is the diffusion domain. Measurements on crystallographically oriented thick sections indicate that helium diffusivity in Durango apatite is nearly isotropic. The best estimate of the activation energy for He diffusion from this apatite is E a = 33 _+ 0.5 kcal/mol, with log(D0) = 1.5 +_ 0.6 cm2/s. The implied He closure temperature for a grain of 100 •m radius is 68{\o}C assuming a 10{\o}C/Myr cooling rate; this figure varies by _5{\o}C for grains ranging from 50 to 150 •m radius. When this apatite is heated to temperatures from 265 to 400{\o}C, a progressive and irreversible change in He diffusion behavior occurs: Both the activation energy and frequency factor are reduced. This transition in behavior coincides closely with progressive annealing of radiation damage in Durango apatite, suggesting that defects and defect annealing play a role in the diffusivity of helium through apatite.},

abstract = {This study investigated the stability of the upper saline plume (USP) within shallow tide-affected submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) zones. In contrast to earlier studies, numerical modeling revealed a number of realistic hydrological and hydrogeological conditions where the USP becomes unstable and salt-fingering flow occurs. These conditions were reasonably well identified in a stability diagram based on two dimensionless numbers that characterize the system. If fingering flow occurs, the SGD pattern is distinctly different from that of stable flow conditions: (i) freshwater discharge zones along the beach face are manifold and change their location with time, (ii) undulating freshwater/seawater interface that is extended along the groundwater flow path, and (iii) the total tide-averaged fresh SGD rate varies considerably in an irregular pattern. This has presumably important implications on reactive transport processes in the subterranean estuary, as well as on the interpretation of field data on water and solute fluxes during SGD.},

abstract = {From the analysis of geological, geodetic and geophysical data we provide clear evidence of seismogenic faults capable of producing large earthquakes in intraplate Europe. Previous studies (Paulissen, Vandenberghe & Gullentops 1985; Van den Berg et al. 1994; Geluk et al. 1994) have yielded some constraints on the rate of crustal deformation along the Roer Valley, a graben structure crossing the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, and have allowed us to address the fundamental questions: can intraplate earthquakes rupture the surface in this part of 'stable' continental Europe, and if so, what is their return period? Detailed palaeoseismic investigations have been carried out in Belgium along a 10 km long fault scarp which is the morphological expression of the Feldbiss Fault, the southwestern border fault of the Roer Graben Camelbeeck & Meghraoui 1996). The scarp is multiple and the frontal fault scarp offsets young deposits and alluvial terraces. Field investigations using geological and geomorphological methodologies combined with geophysical prospecting provide evidence of Holocene seismic surface faulting. From 14C dating it is suggested that the last earthquake along the fault scarp occurred between 610 AD and 890 AD. Levelling profiles across the scarp suggest that it produced a vertical coseismic displacement of 0.5-1 m along the scarp. If we suppose that the last surface-faulting earthquake ruptured the whole seismogenic layer (17 km thickness) over a minimum length (10 km) corresponding to the length of the Bree scarp with an average slip of 0.6 m, its seismic moment was at least 3.1x1018 N m (MW=6.3) for an average rigidity mu=3x1010 Pa. By estimating the offset of the main terrace of the Maas River by slippage along the Feldbiss Fault, we calculate the average Late Pleistocene vertical deformation rate as 0.08+-0.04 mm yr-1. Palaeoseismic information combining the trench and geomorphic observations suggests the occurrence of two surface-faulting earthquakes during the last 20 kyr. A third dates before 28-35 kyr BP. Then, if the time distribution of earthquakes is uniform, a return period of 12+-5 ka and a vertical deformation rate of 0.06+-0.04 mm yr-1 are inferred.},

abstract = {A quantification of groundwater fluxes in the hydrologic cycle for large river basins and on a global scale is reported in this paper. Groundwater contributions to river runoff (i.e. baseflow), direct submarine groundwater discharge to the ocean floor, and salt throughput to oceans and seas are analyzed. The baseflow/precipitation and baseflow/river runoff ratios are found to be approximately 10% and 30% on a world-wide basis, showing great geographical variability across the major continents of the Earth. Direct groundwater discharge to the ocean floor is only 6% of the total water influx to oceans and seas, yet, it contributes a salt load to oceans and seas that is approximately 50% of the salt loading by rivers. Factors and uncertainties germane to global groundwater balancing, recent anthropogenic modifications of groundwater contributions to runoff, and the likely role of potential global warming in groundwater circulation are discussed. Over the last 300 years baseflow contribution to river runoff has slightly increased, whereas the river runoff has declined as a result of anthropogenic modifications to the natural environment. Assuming a 10% increase in global annual precipitation from potential greenhouse warming, the associated increases in baseflow contribution to river runoff and direct groundwater discharge to oceans would amount to 1200 km3 year-1 and 260 km3 year-1, respectively. The additional salt load to oceans and seas by direct groundwater flow is estimated at 140 000 000 t year-1. Salinity of oceans and seas could rise if their water volumes do not increase enough to offset the larger salt load. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Sections oriented within 25{degrees} of all transport directions can be restored and result in [&le;]10% error in the amount of extension-compression. Extensional faults are commonly oblique to the transport direction, so the inferred extension direction may be verified by dip analysis of the pre-rift section. Where oblique extensional faults are reactivated during compression, the compressional vector is best determined from the orientation and magnitude of large, curved inversion anticlines. For strongly inverted and eroded anticlines, where Tmax is not at the present day, palaeotemperature gradients determined regionally from borehole vitrinite reflectance and fission track profiles constrain the amount of denudation allowing reconstruction of the original anticline morphology. The timing of inversion and erosion determined by apatite fission track analysis allow the eroded strata to be replaced on the section and the inversion restored to reveal the amounts of extension and compression and the syn-rift basin morphology, which may constrain hydrocarbon migration paths.

abstract = {We present a numerical pure-shear stretching model to study the effect of the “depth of lithospheric necking” on the state of flexure at extensional basins. This model avoids the need for low flexural rigidities during synrift basin subsidence. The model also accounts for long-standing rift flank uplifts in the absence of significant thermal anomalies or underplating beneath rift shoulders, and it predicts low $\beta$ factors beneath basin centers. Numerical modeling of synthetic continental rift zones and rifted continental margins together with their gravity characteristics demonstrates that isostatic residual anomalies are sensitive indicators of the state of flexure at extensional basins, particularly at basin margins. Isostatic residual anomalies are particularly useful to study the state of lithospheric flexure because the results are not biased by assumptions on the loads that have to be made in a forward modeling approach. Previous studies of lithospheric flexure and gravity modeling might have underestimated flexural rigidities at extensional basins. Comparison of predicted gravity anomaly signatures with gravity data suggests that at narrow rift basins and young rifted continental margins, upward flexure occurs more commonly than does downward flexure. This can be explained by intermediate or deep levels of necking (>15 km). For rifted continental margins, the apparent transition in the state of flexure during basin evolution from upward to downward flexure points to intermediate levels of necking (15–20 km). The occurrence of intermediate to deep levels of necking at narrow rift basins and intermediate levels of necking at rifted margins is in accordance with brittle-ductile rheological models of the lithosphere. An intermediate depth range for the level of lithospheric necking at rifted continental margins is consistent with a scenario in which rifting preferentially occurs in an area where the lithosph{\`{e}}re is weakened by a thickened crust Rifting in areas of stronger lithosphere, as for example cratons, is probably more often associated with a deep level of necking, explaining the widespread occurrence of rift shoulders at failed rift basins. We have tested several depths of necking and a model of local isostasy for the Gulf of Lions margin in the northwestern Mediterranean. At positions of deep synrift grabens, models with depths of necking of 25–35 km predict crustal thicknesses that are more in accordance with observations than are models with a shallower level of necking. It appears that local isostasy cannot account for the present-day basin configuration and at the same time reproduce the observed strongly laterally varying bathymetry at the end of rifting, supporting a significant postrift flexural rigidity.},

Zircons and apatites from the basin and the surrounding basement yield FT ages averaging [$\sim$]180 Ma and [$\sim$]140-150 Ma, respectively (i.e., younger than the age of the host rocks). However, along the border fault of the basin, zircon ages exceed 300 Ma and apatite ages are as high as 214 Ma (i.e., older than the depositional ages). The proximity of samples heated to >220 {+/-}40 {degrees}C, which reset zircons, and those never heated above 120 {+/-}20 {degrees}C across a zone 5-10 km wide indicates an anomalous zone of low temperatures that resulted from the downwelling of water at the border faults. The FT results and other indicators of Hydrothermal flow attest to the circulation of relatively high temperature (100-250 {degrees}C) fluids in a pervasive Jurassic hydrothermal convection system. The fluid-convection downwelling along the border fault of the basin may be the consequence of the high topography that bordered the Newark basin in Triassic and Jurassic time. Hydrothermal flow ended by the time coastal-plain sediments covered the basin. Hydrothermal fluids circulating in extensional environments are potentially very important in modifying the temperature structure of the basins and crust.},

Yet the factors controlling these interactions are still poorly understood. In this work, a new 2-D (cross-sectional) analytical groundwater flow solution is used to derive a dimensionless criterion that expresses the conditions under which the water table “outcrops” (i.e., reaches the land surface). The criterion gives insights into the functional relationships between geology, topography, climate, and resulting water table outcrops. This sheds light on the debate about the topographic control of groundwater flow, as the effective role of the topography is to constrain the water table only where it outcrops. The criterion provides a practical tool to predict water table outcrops if physical parameters are known and to estimate physical parameters if on the contrary water table outcrops are known.

abstract = {Apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th)/He data from the Sandia Mountains and Hagan embayment provide new insights into the thermal and tectonic evolution of the eastern flank of the Rio Grande rift in northern New Mexico. AFT and (U-Th)/He data reveal rapid cooling in the Sandia Mountains between 22 and 17 Ma, followed by a decrease in cooling rate at 16 to 14 Ma that temporally corresponds to a hiatus in deposition in the Albuquerque basin. A second increase in cooling rate at approximately 14 Ma was followed by continued slow cooling until present. Cooling ages from Jurassic to Permian sandstones in the Hagan embayment northeast of the Sandia Mountains are used to constrain the thermal conditions in Oligocene time that are necessary to map cooling histories into exhumation histories, thereby providing a limit on the amount of section removed during rift flank development. Thermal modeling, geologic constraints, and low-temperature thermochronology are used to demonstrate that the heat flow in the Sandia Mountain region was at least 25 mW/m2 higher during Oligocene time compared to today. Furthermore, at least 3.1 km of material has been exhumed from the Sandia Mountains and 2.4 km of rock uplift occurred during flexural tilting of the block since middle Miocene time.},

abstract = {The occurrence of permafrost in a highly permeable catchment has a profound effect on runoff generation. The presence of permafrost effectively makes the subsoil impermeable. Therefore, overland flow can be the dominant runoff-generating process during periglacial conditions. The absence of permafrost will promote subsurface drainage and, therefore, saturation excess overland flow can become the dominant runoff-generating process during temperate conditions. In this paper, we present a numerical modelling study in which the effect of alternating climate-related phases of permafrost and nonpermafrost on catchment hydrology and geomorphology is investigated. Special attention is given to the characteristics of the channel network being formed, and the sediment yield from these catchments. We find that channel networks expand under permafrost conditions and contract under nonpermafrost conditions. A change from permafrost to nonpermafrost conditions is characterised by a decrease in sediment yield, while a change towards permafrost conditions is marked by a peak in sediment yield. This peak is explained by the build-up of a reservoir of erodible sediment during the nonpermafrost phase. The driving force behind this reservoir build-up may be local base-level change due to tectonic uplift or eustacy. We present a number of experiments, which show the details of this process. The results are in line with existing reconstructions of climate and fluvial dynamics during the Pleistocene in Europe and offer a new explanation to these observations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A study is made of the dependence of the effective permeability of sand-shale reservoirs on the geometry of the shale inclusions. Numerical simulations are described in which factors such as the orientation and the degree of anisotropy of the shales, their volume fraction and the permeability contrast ratio between the shale and the sandstone were varied. Two different reservoir models were used in the simulations: one in which the shales were in the form of random, overlapping spheroidal inclusions, and one in which the shales were generated by a geostatistical technique. The computed effective permeability data are compared with a variety of analytical models in an attempt to discover ‘rules of thumb'for the estimation of the effective permeability of sand-shale reservoirs for use in a range of practical situations. The main technical way in which this study advances on previous work is in its use of a computationally efficient, random walk algorithm for calculating the effective permeability, which has enabled larger volumes to be simulated and, hence, a thorough investigation of finite-size effects to be made. Another advantage of the work reported here is the general nature of the sand-shale geometries used in the numerical simulations and the extensive comparisons with analytical models.},

abstract = {Step-heating experiments on 17 calcites from 11 different samples and 6 dolomites from 5 samples suggest a closure temperature of He in carbonates $\sim$70���10��C for a cooling rate of 10��C/m.y. The bulk closure temperature in some samples may tend slightly higher due to the presence of diffusion domains larger (and therefore more retentive) than the sites in which the majority of He resides. The diffusivity of He in calcite is independent of the genesis of the mineral (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic) or the source of the He (radiogenic, common, or laboratory induced) and in all samples analyzed the effective diffusion dimension for He is smaller than the size of the crystals investigated. Although calcite is a low-U mineral, this shortcoming can be overcome by analyzing large samples (>2�mm diameter) provided samples have a minimum of $\sim$0.3�ppm�U; samples with smaller concentrations of alpha-producers are unlikely to produce enough radiogenic 4He sufficient to overwhelm He present in the crystals at the time they passed through their closure temperature.},

@article{Keen1985,
abstract = {Summary. The thermal and mechanical behaviour of the lithosphere during rifting is investigated using a two layer model for its rheology and different driving forces for the rift process. The uppermost crustal layer is assumed to deform by brittle failure, while the lower lithosphere, including the lower crust, is assumed to behave as a Newtonian viscous fluid. Results of numerical modelling of the deformation, flow and heat transport in the viscous layer are presented, in which viscosity is a strong function of depth (and temperature). Deformation of the upper brittle layer is complex and difficult to quantify. Thus deformation of this upper layer was approximated by a simple kinematic model in which the layer is thinned by an amount proportional to the amount of extension it experiences. Two fundamentally different driving forces were investigated. They correspond to active rifting, in which the litho-sphere is thinned by an upwelling limb of a convection cell or mantle plume, and to passive rifting, or stretching of the lithosphere. The results show that for zones of stretching which are wider than the thickness of the viscous layer, thinning at all levels in the lithosphere can be described by a single parameter, beta, as in earlier stretching models. This is not always true when the rift zone is narrow, or near the edges of the rift zone. Initial subsidence due to isostatic and thermal changes during stretching slows as stretching progresses, giving an exponential character to the rift stage subsidence. Active rifting is associated with thermal uplift. In this case lithospheric deformation is confined to a narrow zone near the base of the lithosphere, and thinning of the crust does not occur until the base of the lithosphere approaches that level. The rate of lithospheric thinning and width of the rift zone depend on the convection velocities in the underlying asthenosphere and on the viscosity-depth gradient near the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Also contributing to the elevation changes during rifting are dynamic stresses which result from the flow. These dynamic affects may significantly modify the uplift or subsidence of the rift zone. Another important process which results from viscous flow is the generation of secondary convection in the upwelling asthenosphere. Ths will further thin the lithosphere and can cause depth-dependent stretching, in which the lower lithosphere is thinned more than the upper lithosphere. Both of these properties of the flow; dynamic stresses and secondary convection, critically depend on absolute values of viscosity and so are not well constrained at present. The model results presented here exhibit the degree of complexity which results from viscous flow in the lower lithosphere and which is matched by the wide variety of observations on rifting.},

abstract = {Results of integrated 2D basin modelling indicate that both sedimentary loading and gas generation play an important role in the overpressure history of the Broad Fourteens Basin. We analysed the influence of time-dependent permeability of faults on the overpressure history and evolution of petroleum systems. We favour time-dependent permeability of faults as the most likely option to explain the present-day near-hydrostatic conditions in the basin, the known location of oil fields, and the location and characteristics of the gas occurrences. The model results further show that the difference in timing of oil charging of the P9 and Q1 Lower Cretaceous oil reservoirs, explains the observed differences in geochemical composition of the accumulated oils. The biodegraded and water-washed nature of the pre-inversion charged Q1 oil reservoir is consistent with the concentrated topography-induced groundwater flow through the Lower Cretaceous reservoir units during the Late Cretaceous inversion period. Late charging of the oil reservoir in the P9 area explains the non-biodegraded character of the accumulated oils. Present-day conditions in the Broad Fourteens Basin are near-hydrostatic. In general, this paper shows that paleohydrodynamic conditions and time-dependent permeability of the hydrogeological framework have influenced significantly the petroleum systems in the basin.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional, porous-medium, steady-state, coupled fluid- and heat-transport models are used to investigate some of the hydrogeological and thermal consequences of steeply dipping fault damage zones in a normally pressured basin setting. Simple geometries and conservative petrophysical properties can produce large-scale buoyancy-driven circulation, both outside and within the fault zone. An average (homogeneous) basin permeability of only 7 mD kh (horizontal permeability) and 0.07 mD kv (vertical permeability) results in a free convection cell of this type, with the upflow being localized by a 300 m wide fault zone (50 mD kh, 0.5 mD kv). Steady-state temperature anomalies as large as 15degreesC at the top of the fault zone can be produced by this arrangement. Smaller values of basin permeability still result in a similar circulation pattern, but at flow rates which produce temperature anomalies that are below detection levels. When the basin fill is more heterogeneous (layered), higher permeabilities can exist in some layers without large-scale convection occurring, because of the dampening effect of other, lower permeability units. In realistic geometrical configurations that are similar to the North Sea Central Graben, the fluid flow system is dominated by within-fault-zone convective circulation that produces local (\textless10 km half-wavelength), high amplitude (50degreesC) temperature anomalies which are comparable to the largest of those actually observed in the subsurface.},

Although a large number of geological maps, regional geological syntheses, and sample-based measurements have been produced, there is no openly available database that integrates rock record-derived data, while also facilitating large-scale, quantitative characterization of the volume, age, and material properties of the upper crust. Here we describe Macrostrat, a relational geospatial database and supporting cyberinfrastructure that is designed to enable quantitative spatial and geochronological analyses of the entire assemblage of surface and subsurface sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. Macrostrat contains general, comprehensive summaries of the age and properties of 33,903 lithologically and chronologically defined geological units distributed across 1,474 regions in North and South America, the Caribbean, New Zealand, and the deep sea. Sample-derived data, including fossil occurrences in the Paleobiology Database, more than 180,000 geochemical and outcrop-derived measurements, and more than 2.3 million bedrock geologic map units from over 200 map sources, are linked to specific Macrostrat units and/or lithologies. Macrostrat has generated numerous quantitative results and its infrastructure is used as a data platform in several independently developed mobile applications. It is necessary to expand geographic coverage and to refine age models and material properties to arrive at a more precise characterization of the upper crust globally and test fundamental hypotheses about the long-term evolution of Earth systems.},

abstract = {The variation of permeability with depth can be probed indirectly by various means, including hydrologic models that use geothermal data as constraints and the progress of metamorphic reactions driven by fluid flow. Geother- mal and metamorphic data combine to indicate that mean permeability (k) of tectonically active continental crust decreases with depth (z) according to log k ? )14–3.2 log z, where k is in m2 and z in km. Other independently derived, crustal-scale k–z relations are generally similar to this power-law curve. Yet there is also substantial evi- dence for local-to-regional-scale, transient, permeability-generation events that entail permeabilities much higher than these mean k–z relations would suggest. Compilation of such data yields a fit to these elevated, transient values of log k ? )11.5–3.2 log z, suggesting a functional form similar to that of tectonically active crust, but shifted to higher permeability at a given depth. In addition, it seems possible that, in the absence of active prograde metamorphism, permeability in the deeper crust will decay toward values below the mean k–z curves. Several lines of evidence suggest geologically rapid (years to 103 years) decay of high-permeability transients toward background values. Crustal-scale k–z curves may reflect a dynamic competition between permeability creation by processes such as fluid sourcing and rock failure, and permeability destruction by processes such as compaction, hydrothermal alteration, and retrograde metamorphism.},

This paper presents the major characteristics of turbulent flux transfers over seven bare-soil surfaces. These sites are located in arid, semiarid, and semihumid regions in Asia and represent a variety of conditions for aerodynamic roughness length (z0m; from ⬍1 to 10 mm) and sensible heat flux (from ⫺50 to 400 W m⫺2). For each site, parameter kB⫺1 [⫽ln(z0m/z0h), where z0h is the thermal roughness length] exhibits clear diurnal variations with higher values during the day and lower values at night. Mean values of z0h for the individual sites do not change significantly with z0m, resulting in kB⫺1 increasing with z0m, and thus the momentum transfer coefficient increases faster than the heat transfer coefficient with z0m. The term kB⫺1 often becomes negative at night for relatively smooth surfaces (z0m ⬃ 1 mm), indicating that the widely accepted excess resistance for heat transfer can be negative, which cannot be explained by current theories for aerodynamically rough surfaces. Last, several kB⫺1 schemes are evaluated using the same datasets. The results indicate that a scheme that can reproduce the diurnal variation of kB⫺1 generally performs better than schemes that cannot},

abstract = {The Moab fault, a basin-scale normal fault that juxtaposes Jurassic eolian sandstone units against Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous shale and sandstone, is locally associated with extensive calcite and lesser quartz cement. We mapped the distribution of fault-related diagenetic alteration products relative to the fault structure to identify sealing and conductive fault segments for fluid flow and to relate fault-fluid-flow behavior to the internal architecture of the fault zone. Calcite cement occurs as vein and breccia cement along slip surfaces and as discontinuous vein cement and concretions in fault damage zones. The cement predominates along fault segments that are composed of joints, sheared joints, and breccias that overprint earlier deformation bands. Using the distribution of fault-related calcite cement as an indicator of paleofluid migration, we infer that fault-parallel fluid flow was focused along fault segments that were overprinted by joints and sheared joints. Joint density, and thus fault-parallel permeability, is highest at locations of structural complexity such as fault intersections, extensional steps, and fault-segment terminations. The association of calcite with remnant hydrocarbons suggests that calcite precipitation was mediated by the degradation and microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons. We propose that the discontinuous occurrence of microbially mediated calcite cement may impede, but not completely seal, fault-parallel fluid flow. Fault-perpendicular flow, however, is mostly impeded by the juxtaposition of the sandstone units against shale and by shale entrainment. The Moab fault thus exemplifies the complex interaction of fault architecture and diagenetic sealing processes in controlling the hydraulic properties of faults in clastic sequences.},

abstract = {The Tri-State and Northern Arkansas districts of the Ozark plateau, North America, are both classic examples of Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) mineralization, formed by continent-scale basinal brine migration as a result of the uplift of the Arkoma foreland basin in response to the Early Permian Ouachita orogeny. The chemistry of the fluids responsible for both sulfide mineralization and gangue precipitation in these districts was studied by quantitative microanalysis of individual fluid inclusions in quartz and sphalerite using 213-nm laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).Using halogen systematics, an evaporative seawater origin for the brines was determined, but higher Br concentrations suggest that the sphalerite-hosted “ore fluids” underwent a significantly greater degree of evaporation in the initial stages of fluid evolution compared to brines hosted by gangue phases. Metal contents of the brines responsible for quartz and dolomite precipitation are low compared to modern basinal brines, but many of the fluid inclusions trapped in sphalerite in both districts contained anomalously high metal concentrations, suggesting that mineralization involved incursion of a metal-rich fluid of distinct geochemistry. Examination of the multicomponent chemical characteristics revealed that dolomitization was probably an important process in the early chemical evolution of fluids that infiltrated both districts. In the Tri-State district, precipitation of sulfides was most likely driven by mixing of the metalliferous fluid with another brine, possibly rich in reduced sulfur. In northern Arkansas the compositional variations observed are best explained by local dissolution of the carbonate host rock. This may have been the process that ultimately drove sulfide deposition through fluid neutralization and reduction. Alternatively, the digestion of the host rock may have been the result of locally generated acidity produced by the deposition of sulfides.The discovery of anomalously metal-rich fluids linked to mineralization suggests that these deposits are not simply the product of typical basin evolution, helping to explain the abundance of MVT mineralization in some forelands, whereas others are barren. It is likely that a significant portion of the history of the hydrothermal flow system was characterized by the precipitation of barren gangue assemblages from metal-poor brines, with metalliferous fluids only being expelled from a specific stratigraphic package at a distinct stage of basin evolution.},

However, the effects of specific geomorphic processes on age-elevation profiles are seldom considered. We integrate apatite (U-Th)/He [AHe], apatite fission track, and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronometry with numerical modeling to determine the effect of glacial erosion on an age-elevation profile from the heavily glaciated southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia. AHe data show a distinct break in slope in age-elevation between 1900&#8211;2100 m. We interpret this break in slope as an acceleration of erosion associated with the onset of alpine glaciation. We use a 3-D thermo-kinematic model to constrain pre- and synglacial erosion rates. Results indicate a preglacial erosion rate of &#8764;0.4 mm/yr that accelerated by a factor of &#8764;2 since &#8764;6 Ma.

@article{Grasle2006,
abstract = {Abstract A long-term pump test was conducted in the KTB pilot borehole (KTB-VB), located in the Oberpfalz area, Germany. It produced 22 300 m3 of formation fluid. Initially, fluid production rate was 29 l min-1 for 4 months, but was then raised to an average of 57 l min-1 for eight more months. The aim of this study was to examine the fluid parameters and hydraulic properties of fractured, crystalline crusts as part of the new KTB programme 'Energy and Fluid Transport in Continental Fault Systems'. KTB-VB has an open-hole section from 3850 to 4000 m depth that is in hydraulic contact with a prominent continental fault system in the area, called SE2. Salinity and temperature of the fluid inside the borehole, and consequently hydrostatic pressure, changed significantly throughout the test. Influence of these quantities on variations in fluid density had to be taken into account for interpretation of the pump test. Modelling of the pressure response related to the pumping was achieved assuming the validity of linear Darcy flow and permeability to be independent of the flow rate. Following the principle 'minimum in model dimension', we first examined whether the pressure response can be explained by an equivalent model where rock properties around the borehole are axially symmetric. Calculations show that the observed pressure data in KTB-VB can in fact be reproduced through such a configuration. For the period of high pumping rate (57 l min-1) and the following recovery phase, the resulting parameters are 2.4 x 10-13 m3 in hydraulic transmissivity and 3.7 x 10-9 m Pa-1 in storativity for radial distances up to 187 m, and 4.7 x 10-14 m3 and 6.0 x 10-9 m Pa-1, respectively, for radial distances between 187 and 1200 m. The former pair of values mainly reflect the hydraulic properties of the fault zone SE2. For a more realistic hydraulic study on a greater scale, program FEFLOW was used. Parameter values were obtained by matching the calculated induced pressure signal to fluid-level variations observed in the KTB main hole (KTB-HB) located at 200 m radial distance from KTB-VB. KTB-HB is uncased from 9031 to 9100 m and shows indications of leakage in the casing at depths 5200-5600 m. Analysis of the pressure record and hydraulic modelling suggest the existence of a weak hydraulic communication between the two boreholes, probably at depths around the leakage. Hydraulic modelling of a major slug-test in KTB-HB that was run during the pumping in KTB-VB reveals the effective transmissivity of the connected formation to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the one determined for the SE2 fault zone.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of diagenetic alterations in siliciclastic sequences is controlled by a complex array of interrelated parameters that prevail during eodiagenesis, mesodiagenesis and telodiagenesis. The spatial distribution of near-surface eogenetic alteration is controlled by depositional facies, climate, detrital composition and relative changes in sea-level. The most important eogenetic alterations in continental sediments include silicate dissolution and the formation of kaolinite, smectite, calcrete and dolocrete. In marine and transitional sediments, eogenetic alterations include the precipitation of carbonate, opal, microquartz, Fe-silicates (glaucony, berthierine and nontronite), sulphides and zeolite. The eogenetic evolution of marine and transitional sediments can probably be developed within a predictable sequence stratigraphic context. Mesodiagenesis is strongly influenced by the induced eogenetic alterations, as well as by temperature, pressure and the composition of basinal brines. The residence time of sedimentary sequences under certain burial conditions is of key importance in determining the timing, extent and patterns of diagenetic modifications induced. The most important mesogenetic alterations include feldspar albitization, illitization and chloritization of smectite and kaolinite, dickitization of kaolinite, chemical compaction as well as quartz and carbonate cementation. Various aspects of deep-burial mesodiagenesis are still poorly understood, such as: (i) whether reactions are accomplished by active fluid flow or by diffusion; (ii) the pattern and extent of mass transfer between mudrocks and sandstones; (iii) the role of hydrocarbon emplacement on sandstone diagenesis; and (iv) the importance and origin of fluids involved in the formation of secondary inter- and intragranular porosity during mesodiagenesis. Uplift and incursion of meteoric waters induce telogenetic alterations that include kaolinitization and carbonate-cement dissolution down to depths of tens to a few hundred metres below the surface.},

abstract = {Evidence for basin scale brine migration and clay mineral diagenesis in the northern Appalachian Basin was investigated using elemental and isotope (129I/I, 87Sr/86Sr) geochemistry of formation waters collected from the Middle to Upper Devonian section of the northern basin margin in western New York, northwest Pennsylvania, and eastern Kentucky. One sample from each of the Mississippian Berea sandstone and the Silurian Medina sandstone were analyzed for comparison. Measured iodine ratios range between 28 to 1,890 × 10−15 and are anomalously high compared to cosmogenic iodine sourced from Devonian age organic matter. Iodine-129 in the waters was largely derived from fissiogenic sources, the spontaneous fission of 238U to produce 129I, with estimated 129I/I values up to 270 × 10−15, which occur locally in the organic-rich shales. There are three water samples that have values of 490 × 10−15, 860 × 10−15, and 1,890 × 10−15, which are above the range for local fissiogenic 129I and may be accounted for by topographically driven, basin scale fluid flow through a regionally high fissiogenic source. Relatively large uranium occurrences lie along the structural front of the Appalachian Basin in the Blue Ridge Province and are situated within hypothesized flow paths parallel to the main compressional direction of the Alleghanian orogeny. Estimated 129I/I values for these uranium occurrences are in excess of 55,000 × 10−15. The strontium isotope composition and Sr concentration of brines display a mixing trend between a highly radiogenic end-member (0.7210) with low Sr (51 mg/L) and a non-radiogenic (0.7100), high Sr (4789 mg/L) end-member. Potassium and boron concentrations are notably depleted relative to evaporated Paleozoic seawater, the hypothesized source of Appalachian Basin brines. The K/Rb values of formation waters are depleted relative to seawater values, but in some cases are well above values indicative of water-rock reactions. The Sr isotopic composition, K and B depletion, and intermediate K/Rb ratios are consistent with smectite diagenesis and paleo-temperatures that are likely greater than approximately 150 °C. These temperatures may be high given the burial history of the study area and support the flow of formation waters from deeper within the basin. The combined isotopic and elemental results of formation waters provide compelling evidence for basin scale fluid migration in the northern Appalachian Basin and are consistent with previously published evidence documented from the rock record, including clay mineral diagenesis and ore deposition.},

The model demonstrates the high sensitivity of biogeochemical Si cycling in the coastal zone to anthropogenic pressures, such as river damming and global temperature rise.

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical model for simulating deformation and induced fluid flow in fold-and-thrust belts. Unfractured rock strata are modeled as poroelastic media while fault zones are treated as plastic-elastic media. We introduce the slip element technique into a finite element code to accommodate large deformations along faults. Thrust displacements, stress field changes, and the effects of thrust faulting on groundwater flow are investigated by solving the coupled stress and flow equations numerically. The calculation shows that when a thrust sheet is displaced along its fault surface, the displacement-induced stress generates high pore pressure zones near the tectonic stress boundary and beneath low permeability ramps. These overpressures cause transient fluid flow across the thrust belt. Sensitivity studies on the hydrologic properties of the fault zone suggest that hydraulic conductivities within a fault play important roles in initiating slip deformation and in determining the extent of transient disturbances to the flow field. Low permeability can result in rapid pore pressure buildup in the fault, thereby reducing the effective strength of the fault which leads to earlier failures. A low-permeability fault can also impede the movement of flow into the footwall, thereby limiting the tectonic impact on the flow system within the hanging-wall. Application of the model to the McConnell Thrust in the Canadian Rockies indicates that the total volume of fluid flow induced by tectonic compression could have been of the order of 105 to 106 m3 over a time period of tens to hundreds of years accompanied by an average 100 m of thrust movement.},

We constructed a detailed south-west north-east geological cross-section of the present-day northern Broad Fourteens Basin, and reconstructed Late Cretaceous basin geometry and topography. Using this geometry in a numerical model of density-dependent topography-driven fluid flow, we modelled several scenarios of meteoric water infiltration with estimated ranges of basin-scale permeabilities and water table head. Results indicate that a deep freshwater lens was developed during Late Cretaceous inversion, if the basin-scale hydraulic conductivity of the Rijnland and Altena Groups was at least 1{\textperiodcentered}10–9 to 1{\textperiodcentered}10–10 m/s, which is in general the highest value for claystones.},

abstract = {Temperature recordings from exploration boreholes for hydrocarbons and geothermal energy are evaluated to select the best-suitable data for determining formation temperature and heat flow in the Northeast German Basin. Repeated temperature logs measured in several boreholes allow a classification into equilibrium logs and perturbed logs. For the latter, a simple empirical correction is proposed based on mean annual ground-surface temperature, the estimated amount of temperature correction at total depth of log, and the depth-dependent cross-over point of temperature perturbation due to drilling. Analysis of bottom-hole temperatures (BHTs) showed that the uncorrected values deviate, on average, by as much as 22.2±10.2°C (1sigma) from the formation temperature. BHTs corrected using the Horner-plot method are systematically too low by 1–2°C compared to values corrected using the exact solution to the full line-source equation. Both correction methods yield values that underestimate formation temperatures by as much as 9°C and 8°C, respectively. The large standard deviation (1sigma) of about ±8°C indicates that a corrected BHT reflects (with 96% confidence, 2sigma) formation temperature not better than ±16°C. However, using temperature logs in conjunction with the corrected BHTs allowed a prediction of formation temperatures with an error less than ±10°C at somewhat deeper depths than the log in several boreholes. The availability of continuous temperature logs as a prerequisite for a reduction of error of BHTs significantly reduced the quantity of useable corrected BHTs in the basin.},

abstract = {The pollen 14 C age and oxygen isotopic composition of siliceous sinter deposits from the former Beowawe geyser field reveal evidence of two hydrothermal discharge events that followed relatively low-magnitude (<M5) earth-quakes of Holocene and late Pleistocene age along the Malpais fault zone in Whirlwind Valley, Nevada, USA. The observed 20‰ trend of decreasing d 18 O over about a 5000-to-7000-year period following each earthquake is consistent with a fault-controlled groundwater flow system that, following initial discharge of deep and hot groundwater, contains increasing amounts of cool meteoric water through time. Model simulations of this hydro-thermal system can only match trends in the isotope data if we include a thousand-fold increase in fault perme-ability (from <10 {\`{A}}14 m 2 to >10 {\`{A}}11 m 2) following each earthquake. However, the timescale for onset of thermal convection implied by an overturned temperature profile in a geothermal well 300 m from the Malpais fault is much shorter: 200–1000 years. We speculate that individual segments of the Malpais fault become clogged on shorter timescales and that upward flow of groundwater subsequently follows new routes to the surface.},

abstract = {Aquifer recharge is one of the most important problems in hydrology from both theoretical and practical points of view. One of the most widely accepted methods to deal with this problem is the use of the Dupuit-Forchheimer theory. This theory assumes that the water table is almost horizontal, the vertical velocity is zero, and the horizontal velocity is uniform with depth. Surfaces of seepage are not considered. Despite these strong limitations the theory is applied, and success is frequently found in many cases despite its fundamental assumptions being violated. In this work an approximate 2-D solution to the problem is sought on the basis of Picard's iteration technique, from which a second-order differential equation for recharge problems is found. On the basis of this solution, a modified, analytical Dupuit-Forchheimer (DF) ellipse is found which compares favorably with the full 2-D solution of the problem. The analytical developments of this theory provide a generalized DF theory which permits as an outcome the analytical determination of the surface of seepage. Citation:},

abstract = {Dissolved neodymium isotopes (143Nd/144Nd, expressed as $\epsilon$Nd) and rare earth elements (REEs) have the potential to trace the provenance of lithogenic material as well as water masses. The central North Pacific is poorly investigated with respect to its Nd isotope signature and REE cycling, and little is known about the contributions of volcanic islands, such as Hawaii, relative to dust input from Asian deserts to the surface water REE budgets. Here we present dissolved Nd isotope and REE data along with long-lived radium isotope activities from Hawaii Ocean Time-Series Station ALOHA and coastal waters from Oahu, sampled for a GEOTRACES process study in February 2011. The data are supplemented with seasonal samples from ALOHA. Our results show a clear influence of the Hawaiian Islands on the coastal ocean and surface waters at ALOHA during February, expressed by higher surface water Ra activities, radiogenic surface $\epsilon$Nd ($\epsilon$Nd = +1.4 to -1.0), and elevated Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* ≥ 1.3). Seasonal cycles of Asian dust deposition most likely contribute to the seasonal $\epsilon$Nd variability of surface waters at ALOHA, as suggested by more negative $\epsilon$Nd and the lack of Eu anomalies in summer. Neodymium isotopes in the intermediate and deep water column at ALOHA trace typical North Pacific water masses, such as North Pacific Intermediate Water and North Pacific Deep Water. We suggest that a radiogenic $\epsilon$Nd excursion in 1000-2000 m water depth, observed in various North Pacific profiles, is controlled by advection of a modified Upper Circumpolar Deep Water or North Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Water. We further present an updated average $\epsilon$Nd signature of -3.5 ± 0.5 for North Pacific Deep Water and show that REE patterns of deep waters at ALOHA are dominantly controlled by vertical processes.},

Metamorphism affects the lithosphere's chemical and mineralogical composition, as well as its physical properties on scales ranging from a nanometer to the size of tectonic plates. Studies of metamorphism during the last couple of decades have revealed that fluids are as important in a changing lithosphere as water is in the biosphere. History-dependent characteristics of metamorphic rocks, such as their microstructure, compositional variation, and deformation features, reflect the dynamics of fluid–rock interactions. Migration of the fluids produced during prograde metamorphic processes or consumed during retrogression links metamorphism at depth to the evolution of the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere.},

The highest displacement rates are due to nontectonic processes, such as active landslides, subsidence and rebound over aquifers, and rapid settling of unconsolidated sediments along the bay margins. Residual displacement rates are determined by removing the contribution of the GPS-derived horizontal velocity field from the InSAR range-change rates. To isolate vertical tectonic rates, we use only those InSAR measurements made on material that was not Quaternary substrate, which is susceptible to nontectonic and seasonally varying ground motions. The InSAR residuals indicate significant uplift over the southern foothills of the active Mount Diablo anticlinorium, the Mission Hills stepover region of the Hayward and Calaveras faults, and the central and southern Santa Cruz Mountains located along a restraining bend of the San Andreas fault. },

abstract = {Studies of inverted basins based solely on the preserved section provide only partial insight into the thermal and tectonic history of basin development. Equally important is that part of the history represented by section removed by erosion during inversion. Thermal History Reconstruction, involving application of Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTATM) and Vitrinite Reflectance (VR) to define the timing and magnitude of key erosional and/or thermal episodes, and integration of this information with data from the preserved section, provides a more complete description. Case histories from the UK, New Zealand and Australia are presented to demonstrate this approach. Much of northern and eastern England, the Irish Sea and the Southern North Sea was affected by heating apparently due largely to additional burial, followed by early Tertiary cooling due to regional uplift and erosion, synchronous with recognized basin inversion events. Heating associated with this episode caused generation of hydrocarbons throughout the region. Areas conventionally regarded as not inverted appear to have been subjected to km-scale uplift and erosion, which was not restricted to classic  inversion axes'. Failure to allow for these effects can lead to a significant underestimation of regional maturity trends. Thermal History Reconstruction is also essential in areas that have undergone more than one episode of inversion. For example in Inner Moray Firth well 12/16--1 maximum palaeotemperatures in the Carboniferous section were reached prior to Hercynian inversion and the chances of preserving any hydrocarbons generated from Carboniferous or older source rocks appear poor. In southeastern Australia, early Cretaceous rift basins underwent mid-Cretaceous inversion at a time of high palaeogeothermal gradients (c. 60{degrees}C km-1), and basement margins were also inverted at that time. Again, early generation implies that the chances of preservation of hydrocarbons are small. By integrating stratigraphic and structural relationships within the preserved section with data on the palaeo-thermal history of a section derived from direct measurements of palaeotemperature profiles, the complete history of hydrocarbon generation may be reconstructed with confidence.},

abstract = {Virgin rock temperatures are important to hydrocarbon exploration, as these temperatures are necessary for the computation of source rock temperatures, and for hydrocarbon generation computations. Several methods have been developed for determination of virgin rock temperatures from maximum temperatures recorded during logging in the past decades. This paper describes an investigation where the calculated virgin rock temperatures from several different methods were examined for bias and accuracy using 18 different measurement series at the Oseberg field. The temperatures were corrected for different depths of burial, and then compared with each other and with drill stem test (DST) measurements to investigate the inaccuracy of the methods. The most advanced methods gave values close to the DST temperatures on average, but with standard deviations as high as 9° C. The less advanced models (like the Horner plot method) have systematically too low virgin rock temperatures (by about 8° C) for the Oseberg field, with standard deviations of 8° C. The errors in calculated virgin rock temperatures are large enough to completely alter predictions of hydrocarbon generation in an area. The large errors are attributed to poor quality data and to physical effects that are not properly taken into account in the temperature calculations. Improved sampling of temperature data can probably reduce the errors to some extent.},

abstract = {It is increasingly apparent that faults are typically not discrete planes but zones of deformed rock with a complex internal structure and three-dimensional geometry. In the last decade this has led to renewed interest in the consequences of this complexity for modelling the impact of fault zones on fluid flow and mechanical behaviour of the Earth's crust. A number of processes operate during the development of fault zones, both internally and in the surrounding host rock, which may encourage or inhibit continuing fault zone growth. The complexity of the evolution of a faulted system requires changes in the rheological properties of both the fault zone and the surrounding host rock volume, both of which impact on how the fault zone evolves with increasing displacement. Models of the permeability structure of fault zones emphasize the presence of two types of fault rock components: fractured conduits parallel to the fault and granular core zone barriers to flow. New data presented in this paper on porosity-permeability relationships of fault rocks during laboratory deformation tests support recently advancing concepts which have extended these models to show that poro-mechanical approaches (e.g., critical state soil mechanics, fracture dilatancy) may be applied to predict the fluid flow behaviour of complex fault zones during the active life of the fault. Predicting the three-dimensional heterogeneity of fault zone internal structure is important in the hydrocarbon industry for evaluating the retention capacity of faults in exploration contexts and the hydraulic behaviour in production contexts. Across-fault reservoir juxtaposition or non-juxtaposition, a key property in predicting retention or across-fault leakage, is strongly controlled by the three-dimensional complexity of the fault zone. Although algorithms such as shale gouge ratio greatly help predict capillary threshold pressures, quantification of the statistical variation in fault zone composition will allow estimations of uncertainty in fault retention capacity and hence prospect reserve estimations. Permeability structure in the fault zone is an important issue because bulk fluid flow rates through or along a fault zone are dependent on permeability variations, anisotropy and tortuosity of flow paths. A possible way forward is to compare numerical flow models using statistical variations of permeability in a complex fault zone in a given sandstone/shale context with field-scale estimates of fault zone permeability. Fault zone internal structure is equally important in understanding the seismogenic behaviour of faults. Both geometric and compositional complexities can control the nucleation, propagation and arrest of earthquakes. The presence and complex distribution of different fault zone materials of contrasting velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening properties is an important factor in controlling earthquake nucleation and whether a fault slips seismogenically or creeps steadily, as illustrated by recent studies of the San Andreas Fault. A synthesis of laboratory experiments presented in this paper shows that fault zone materials which become stronger with increasing slip rate, typically then get weaker as slip rate continues to increase to seismogenic slip rates. Thus the probability that a nucleating rupture can propagate sufficiently to generate a large earthquake depends upon its success in propagating fast enough through these materials in order to give them the required velocity kick. This propagation success is hence controlled by the relative and absolute size distributions of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening rocks within the fault zone. Statistical characterisation of the distribution of such contrasting properties within complex fault zones may allow for better predictive models of rupture propagation in the future and provide an additional approach to earthquake size forecasting and early warnings.},

abstract = {Vitrinite reflectance profiles from three drill holes in Oregon where sediments are mantled by thick sequences of volcanic rocks suggest that the sediments were subjected to an unusual diagenetic history. Anomalous, near-constant maturation profiles in sedimentary sequences more than 1300 m thick indicate that the levels of thermal maturity of organic matter in the sediments below the volcanic cover of the Pacific northwest were sufficiently high to have generated hydrocarbons. A hydrothermal mechanism appears to be the most effective form of thermal input, and supporting evidence can be found in the authigenic mineralization of the sediments. The occurrence of vertical maturation profiles in east-central Oregon may be associated with moderate-temperature geothermal systems resulting from a late Oligocene to early Miocene thermal event related to the incipient stages of basaltic volcanism of the Columbia River Group. The uniform maturation of the entire sedimentary column under the volcanic cover has broad implications for the exploration for oil and gas in the Pacific northwest because the presence of mature source rocks in these volcanically lidded basins provides some insight into the petroleum potential of the large volcanic-covered areas in Oregon, Washington, and California.},

The quantity and composition of the kerogen and the burial history of the source rocks determine the volumes of petroleum generated; however, the migration from the compartments in an oil and gas phase is a pressure-driven process in which the flow direction is controlled by the configuration and internal pressures of the fluid compartments. Many sedimentary basins contain layers of two or more superimposed hydrogeological systems. The shallow systems are usually basin wide in extent and exhibit normal hydrostatic pressures. The deeper systems, where the oil is generated, are not basin wide and are abnormally over pressured. They usu lly consist of a series of individual fluid compartments that are not in hydraulic pressure communication with each other nor with the overlying hydrodynamic regime. Tops of fluid compartments in currently sinking basins do not always follow a specific stratigraphic horizon. They frequently have planar tops and subsurface temperatures ranging from 90 degrees to 100 degrees C (194 degrees to 212 degrees F). The tops in clastic sediments appear to be caused by carbonate mineralization along a thermocline. In the North Sea, the depth to the top of the deepest seal changes with the geothermal gradient. The seal is deeper where the gradient is lower. The generation of oil and gas within the compartments plus the thermal expansion of pore fluids eventually causes fracturing of the top compartment seal during periods of basin sinking. Hydrocarbons and other pore fluids then move vertically into the overlying lower pressured sediments and accumulate in the nearest structural and stratigraphic traps. Seal fracturing causes a pressure drop with compartment fluids rushing to the breakout point. The compartment then re-seals and pressure builds to another breakout. This episodic process continues with resealing and breakout cycles probably occurring in intervals of thousands of years in rapidly sinking basins such as the United States Gulf Coast. This concept of episodic dewatering of deep-basin fluid compartments needs to be considered n any basin-modeling program where the bulk of the oil generation occurs in the compartmented overpressured section of the basin and the oil moves vertically into the normally pressured rocks above.},

abstract = {Tritium dating of groundwater and a radon mass balance was used to assess the contribution of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to a nutrient budget in a tropical reef lagoon (Rarotonga, Cook Islands). Open ocean exchange accounted for the largest percentage of potential lagoon exports (nitrogen (N) = 61%, phosphorous (P) = 22%) with N export mostly in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) (93% of total N). SGD accounted for 29% and 11% of exported N and P respectively. Overall we could account for 92% of dissolved N but only 36% of dissolved P leaving the lagoon. However, if DON is assumed to be recalcitrant, SGD would be the major driver of lagoon N and would account for 81% of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) inputs and 47% of DIN exported form the lagoon. A small scale ($\sim$ 50 m), high definition survey indicated areas of higher NH4+ towards the middle of the lagoon. This is indicative of SGD input away from the seepage face and may mean that SGD measurements made at the beach face underestimate the broader contribution of SGD to nutrient fluxes. Time series observations during a 100 mm rain event indicated that these episodes can deliver high nutrient loads to the lagoon and may contribute to closing the phosphorous budget. Analysis of tritium concentrations in groundwater, surface waters and springs showed that old, deep groundwater (10–93 years old) was the main source of SGD derived nutrients to the lagoon. This study demonstrates that there may be a long time lag between nutrient infiltration into aquifers and the discharge of nutrient loaded groundwater into the lagoon. As such, potential mitigation measures which decrease terrestrial nutrient loads may not result in decreased SGD nutrient fluxes for decades to come.},

abstract = {Fission-track (FT) thermochronology is a tool routinely used for studies of surface denudation because of its sensitivity to the low temperatures found in the uppermost part of the crust. FT ages and associated track length distributions are regularly interpreted assuming a steady-state temperature field and only conductive heat transfer. However, application of the method to thermochronological studies based on such interpretations may lead to invalid conclusions, if the temperatures at a certain depth had actually varied with time. For example, the convective transfer of heat by hydrothermal fluids can cause transient thermal events within the upper crust. In particular, fluid circulation along fault zones can result in substantial convective heat transport and cause temperature anomalies in the adjacent rocks (Zuther & Brockamp 1988, Fleming et al. 1998, Lampe & Person 2002, B{\"{a}}chler et al 2003). As a consequence, any refined interpretation of FT data requires a thorough understanding of the upper crustal temperature field and its evolution through time. The main objective of this study is to assess quantitatively how convective heat transport influences the upper crustal 1 Geologisches Institut, Universit{\"{a}}t Freiburg, Albertstr. 23b, D-79104 Freiburg 2 Geol.-Pal{\"{a}}ont.

Modelling utilizes Finite Element techniques and the software FEFLOW, respectively. Indepth parameter studies (including fault geometry, erosion rate, hydraulic potential, hydraulic and material properties) are conducted on two-dimensional (cross-sectional) models of fault zones. After evaluating the relative importance of different variables relevant to fluid circulation in a palaeogeothermal system, the time-temperature (tT) histories of particle points are tracked as erosion moves them closer to surface. These tT-paths are used in a forward modelling approach to determine the expected FT age and track length distributions. For each parameter study, a corresponding set of FT parameters is produced, thus, providing a catalogue of FT ages and track length distributions, which will help to interpret real data sets. One of the goals of the project is to investigate the regional impact of convectiveheat transport on the interpretation of FT data and other thermal data from the Black Forest (SWGermany). The modelling techniques outlined above will be applied to field data from the Baden-Baden and Offenburg troughs in the northern and central Black Forest.

abstract = {Despite the increasing application of apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronology in a range of settings, the technique suffers from two major unresolved problems which preclude reliable thermal history interpretations on a routine basis. One problem is the common but unexplained over-dispersion of single grain ages compared to predictions based on accepted models of diffusion systematics (including enhanced He retentivity due to the buildup of radiation damage in the apatite crystal lattice). A second related problem is that the widely adopted “RDAAM” model does not provide an accurate representation of the degree to which helium retentivity is enhanced as a result of the accumulation of radiation damage. Until these problems are resolved and eliminated, thermal history interpretations derived from this method cannot be regarded as reliable. Routine application of the technique requires a more rigorous quantitative understanding of these factors. Further experimental studies are required to identify all significant sources of variation in measured ages and to develop more accurate models of the thermal response of the system, combined with rigorous calibration and validation against independent methods in well-constrained natural settings. Only once this is achieved will the technique be capable of producing robust and reliable interpretations.},

The timing of the main phase of tectonic subsidence shifted from early Oligocene in the western part of the peripheral foreland to the early Miocene in the eastern part. These temporal and spatial changes in tectonic subsidence reflect a change from oblique dextral to sinistral convergence between the Alpine nappe stack and its foreland. The main phase of sediment accumulation was delayed to the early Miocene and led to the infill of the basin and a major second, sediment-load driven phase of basement subsidence. Sediment accumulation rates in the basin reflect the build-up of topography in the Alpine mountain chain. Since approximately 6 Ma a pronounced regional uplift of the entire Molasse basin has taken place, marking the transition from lateral extrusion to orthogonal contraction within the Alpine system and deep-seated changes in geodynamic boundary conditions, possibly due to delamination of previously thickened lithosphere. Surface uplift is contemporaneous with similar processes in extra-Alpine Central Europe, where it is interpreted to reflect intra-plate stress changes.},

abstract = {Field studies of small normal faults (throws of metres to tens of metres) show that their fault cores consist of breccias that vary in thickness along the fault plane. Commonly, the down-dip variation in the breccia thickness is 0-1 m with a wavelength of 5-10 m. The breccia acts mechanically as an inclusion; soft, ductile and sometimes creeping when the fault zone is active, but stiff and brittle when the fault zone is inactive. During interseismic periods, and when the fault has become inactive, the breccia behaves as a very dense, low-permeability material that is a barrier to transverse flow of groundwater. The breccia barrier thus collects water and channels it downdip or updip along the contact between the fault core and the damage zone. For a typical 1-m-thick interseismic breccia, the maximum transmissivity is estimated at Tp ∼ 10-10 m2 s-1. The field data, however, indicate that during the high strain rates associated with faulting, seismogenic slip may occur either along the breccia, or along its contacts with the damage zone. The resulting fractures with apertures of ∼ 0.3 cm may temporarily increase the transmissivity of the fault core by at least 8 orders of a magnitude, to as much as Tf ∼ 10-2 m2 s-1. It is suggested that slip of faults of this type is commonly associated with the flow of overpressured water into the fault plane. High water pressure lowers the critical driving shear stress needed for fault slip and may greatly increase the aperture, hence the fluid transport, of the slipping fracture. Theoretical considerations indicate that, other things being equal, fluid flow along strike-slip faults is favoured over flow along dip-slip faults and that, generally, the steeper the dip of the fault, the more effective it is for fluid transport. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Stepwise degassing diffusion experiments on 39 different apatite samples using radiogenic 4He and proton-induced 3He reveal a range in closure temperature (Tc) from ?????50 to 115????C, for a cooling rate of 10????C/Myr. There is no correlation between helium diffusion and apatite chemistry including F/Cl ratio, but the closure temperature is positively correlated with the radiogenic 4He concentration ([4He]) in each sample. We argue that [4He] is a proxy for a sample's natural exposure to actinide radioactivity below the closure temperature, and that helium diffusion in apatite is impeded by radiation-induced damage to the apatite structure. The kinetics must therefore be an evolving function of time; measured diffusivities thus reflect a snapshot in time and cannot alone be applied to the thermochronometric interpretation of a given sample. The effect of radiation damage on helium diffusion appears to far exceed other known controls on helium diffusivity, including grain size. Our diffusion data are well described by a previously proposed, quantitative model that consists of two Arrhenius relations, one for volume diffusion through undamaged mineral structure and one for release of helium from radiation damage "traps." The unknown parameters in this "trapping model" were determined from the diffusion experiments, and allow us to develop a tentative mathematical function that relates diffusivity to temperature and [4He]. By inserting this function into a 4He production-diffusion model we have explored how these results affect the interpretation of apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry. The model predicts that the effective 4He closure temperature of apatite will vary with cooling rate and effective U concentration (eU) and may differ from the commonly assumed Tc of 70????C by up to ?? 15????C. The 4He partial retention zone will look similar to previous expectations, but its depth will depend on accumulation time and on eU. Most notably, samples subjected to reheating after accumulation of substantial radiation damage will be more retentive than previously expected. These predictions are consistent with recent observations of unexpected apatite (U-Th)/He ages in some settings. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During the Pliocene-Quaternary time interval, the peripheral parts of the Pannonian Basin system have been uplifted and subsidence in the basin centre accelerated, causing a distinctive truncation pattern in the basin stratigraphy. Stress analyses indicate that the Pannonian Basin system, originally formed in an extensional regime, is subjected to a compressive stress since the early Pliocene. Results of forward modelling of basin subsidence and sedimentary filling along a cross-section through the southern part of the Pannonian Basin demonstrate that a change of the basin shape due to the compressive stress can successfully explain the observed pattern of differential uplift and subsidence occurring since the early Pliocene. In addition, the forward modelling of subsidence and fill provides constraints for the depth of lithospheric necking during extension, the palaeowater-depth history and lake-level changes in the southern part of the Pannonian Basin. Compaction-driven fluid flow modelling shows that the first significant overpressures in the southern part of the Pannonian Basin developed during progradation of a large deltaic system, at a time when sedimentation rates increased rapidly. Due to the stress-induced acceleration of subsidence during Pliocene to Quaternary times, sedimentation rates increased again, causing a further increase of overpressure. The Pliocene stress induced uplift of the basin flanks combined with a preceding lake-level fall created a larger gravity potential of the groundwater table, enhancing the influx of meteoric water into the basin. This can explain observed diagenetic patterns in the southern part of the Pannonian Basin.},

abstract = {The Nieuwerkerk Formation is a major Lower Cretaceous synrift and postrift fluvial unit in the West Netherlands Basin (southwest Netherlands) that attains thicknesses in excess of 1 km in places. A strong tectonic overprint on its deposition and a large degree of facies heterogeneity have complicated correlation and greatly hampered understanding reservoir and seal distribution within the unit. The integrated application of fluvial sequence stratigraphic concepts with biostratigraphic dating and the correlation of cycles of changing accommodation to sediment supply ratio (A/S cycles) on three-dimensional (3-D) seismic, well-log, and core data have allowed a much improved understanding of reservoir facies distribution within the Nieuwerkerk Formation.

A major intraformational unconformity divides the Nieuwerkerk Formation into two members. The lower of these, the Alblasserdam Member, is predominantly nonmarine and has a significant tectonic depositional overprint. Correlation within this member is dependent on the identification of base-level transit cycles probably induced by pulses of tectonism. The inclusion of 3-D seismic isopach data facilitates mapping thicknesses and reservoir properties of the Alblasserdam Member in areas with no well control. The upper member, the Rodenrijs Claystone Member, was deposited during the postrift stage and is predominantly a coastal-plain succession. Biostratigraphic correlation proved useful in subdividing this unit and correlating key seismostratigraphic markers. Use of biostratigraphic and cyclostratigraphic correlation techniques allowed chronostratigraphically consistent reservoir maps to be made of the constituent members of the Nieuwerkerk Formation. These maps exhibit localized nonmarine syndepositional basins (Alblasserdam Member sand depocenters), followed by gradual southward, landward stepping of facies tracts of the Rodenrijs Claystone Member above the intraformational unconformity. The Rodenrijs Claystone Member is capped by a marine transgression that terminated fluvial deposition in this part of the basin. Interestingly, no major lacustrine facies have been identified in the fluvial units in the West Netherlands Basin, rendering it somewhat anomalous among rift basins.},

abstract = {The pattern of fault reactivation, basin deformation and concentration of seismicity along the main trans-Netherlands fault zone, located NW-SE across the centre of the Netherlands, indicates that this zone is a major zone of weakness. Gravity modelling reveals after back-stripping of the sedimentary succession a distinctive continuous positive anomaly that can be explained by lithospheric sources. This zone of weakness is therefore likely to have a major influence on the tectonic processes currently active in the Netherlands region. We give a review of the tectonic history of the Netherlands and then present the results of a quantitative study of the reactivation of basin boundary faults and the influence on the surrounding basin. Well-data, balanced and back-stripped cross-sections are used to constrain the lithosphere rheology. The lithosphere rheology modelling results show a weak coupling between upper crustal deformation and the subcrustal lithosphere. A finite element modelling approach focussing on the upper crust is carried out in which the basin boundary faults are assigned various dips. The modelling results indicate that, for continuous reactivation of basin boundary faults, the presence of both a pre-existing weakness and a reduced friction angle is required. The latter implies that large displacements accommodated by primary faults cannot be directly attributed to the relative weakness of these faults compared to the secondary faults, which is in close accordance with inferences from trenching. A reduced friction angle has a significant effect on lithospheric strength and appears to be the major controlling factor in the reactivation of basin boundary faults.},

The shape of the quartz veins indicates intense inhomogeneous ductile deformation of the host rock during opening and sealing, controlled by the presence of the cohesionless fluid-filled fractures. The vein quartz microfabrics indicate crystallization in an open cavity, implying a stage of very high permeability and fluid flow.

abstract = {Groundwater is a life-sustaining resource that supplies water to billions of people, plays a central part in irrigated agriculture and influences the health of many ecosystems1,2. Most assessments of global water resources have focused on surface water3-6, but unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on both regional7,8 and global scales9-11. It remains unclear how the rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. Here we define the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to agriculture, especially in Asia and North America. We estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater-dependent ecosystems are under threat. That said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. The groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at an aquifer scale. It can be combined with the water footprint and virtual water calculations12-14, and be used to assess the potential for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref15. The method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries, forestry or soil. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Geomechanical properties of sedimentary rocks, compaction behaviour and strength characteristics, in-situ stresses and fracturing mechanisms are important aspects when evaluating strategies for well drilling and reservoir production, stimulation and monitoring. The main objective of this paper is to point out that the effects of chemical compaction, diagenetic processes and cementation must be considered in addition to the mechanical processes governed by effective stresses. Shales and sandstones may become brittle at shallow depth when carbonate cemented and may remain only lightly quartz cemented to a burial depth of 2-3 km with a low shear strength. Fractures are then only open if the fluid over-pressure exceeds the horizontal stress, and the effective stresses driving compaction must then be small. During deeper burial, tectonic fractures will gradually be sealed with cement. Below 2-3 km depth, compaction is mainly chemical involving dissolution and precipitation of minerals. Rapid expulsion of pore water from mudstones is not possible due to the low permeability and slow mechanical and chemical compaction rates. The high confining stress during progressive burial makes open fractures unlikely at normal pressures, often resulting in over-pressures and hydro-fracturing. Open extensional fractures typically develop during uplifts and basin inversion when there is no fluid expulsion from compaction or petroleum generation. Tectonically induced lateral stress may also cause mechanical and chemical compaction thus reducing plate tectonic stress in sedimentary basins. Local gravitational stress and differential compaction may account for some of the stress anomalies observed in basins like the North Sea.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity accounts for several paradoxes in groundwater flow and solute transport. One of the most striking observations is the emergence of scale effects in transmissivity, that is, the increase in effective transmissivity (or hydraulic conductivity, for that matter) with increasing scale of observation. Traditional stochastic approaches, where transmissivity is treated as a multilog-normal random function, lead to a large-scale effective transmissivity equal to the geometric average of local measurements. We present several field cases in which large-scale transmissivities are indeed larger than the geometric average of local tests. This suggests that the assumption of multilog-normality may not be valid in many cases, even if point T values display a log-normal distribution. We conjecture that scale dependence of T may, in part, be a consequence of high T zones being better connected than average or low T zones, a feature which may occur in many geological environments, but which is not consistent with multinormal log-T fields. We go on to generate a suite of log-T fields with a normal distribution for point values but non-multinormal spatial correlation. In all our fields, high T zones show longer correlations than average of low T zones. By simulating flow through these synthetic fields under simple boundary conditions, and estimating their effective transmissivity values, we conclude that these types of departures from the multilog-normality assumption lead consistently to scale effects.},

abstract = {[1] Density-dependent circulation of seawater in coastal aquifers results in submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) across the seabed that is a mixture of terrestrial groundwater and former marine water. In this study, the controls of the relative amount of seawater to freshwater in SGD were investigated numerically using the FEFLOW and SUTRA codes. It was found that the key controls could be expressed in the form of a single nondimensional recirculation number that incorporates the combined effects of free convection, forced convection, and hydrodynamic dispersion on convective overturn within the coastal salt wedge. Anisotropy effects were incorporated into the recirculation number with limited success based on the principle of equivalent isotropic hydraulic conductivity. The type of boundary condition employed along the seabed was shown to be important. Convective overturn was substantially increased if backward dispersion of salt into the aquifer from along the outflowing portion of the seabed boundary was prevented. Overall, the results demonstrated a strong dependence of convective overturn on the aquifer dispersivities, suggesting that results from numerical simulations are problematic to apply to real aquifer systems that typically exhibit uncertain, scale-dependent dispersion properties.},

Six profile-lines with total length of 13982 m provided information on the 40-600 m depth range, covering Lower Pleistocene to Miocene strata with special emphasis on the Plio-Pleistocene Kieseloolite formation. Data quality depends on near-surface conditions and on degree of deformation in some fault zones, with better results for seismic detonator sources compared to vibroseis sources. The new data confirm the segmented character of the fault system with occurrence of fault bends, relay ramps and branching of overlapping fault sequences, testifying of the strong tectonic activity during the lower Pleistocene. Antiform structures along the Bichterweerd scarp, relaying the Feldbiss to the Geleen fault in the Meuse valley, are presented as a model for the Tertiary evolution of the Bree Uplift.},

abstract = {The thermal history of outcropping Devonian sediments of the northern Appalachian Basin, New York, has been investigated using fission track analysis of detrital apatites from 57 sandstone samples. Based on lengths and apparent age measurements using fission tracks in apatite it is concluded that Lower Devonian sediments presently at the surface in the Catskill region were cooled rapidly from temperatures higher than about 110°C during Early Cretaceous times (120–140 Ma ago). In the western part of New York (Wellsville-Buffalo) data from late Devonian sediments are consistent with cooling at the same time as that identified for the Catskill region but from lower temperatures, in the range of approximately 80–110°C, the maximum temperature these sediments experienced since deposition. For a pre-uplift paleogeothermal gradient of 25–35°C/km, the confined track length data indicates uplift and erosion of ∼ 2–3 km for western New York and greater than ∼ 3–4 km for the Catskill region, a differential uplift pattern which is consistent with the historical stratigraphic data from the region. This conclusion is at variance with earlier interpretations put forth by others.  Rapid broad scale uplift and erosion of the scale identified imply that large volumes of sediment could have been supplied from the northern Appalachian Basin during the Early Cretaceous. This timing for the dominant post-Devonian cooling phase in the basin is not accounted for by recent models of the tectonic evolution of the Appalachian Orogen but is compatible with the change from carbonate to siliciclastic deposition in the Atlantic coastal plain. It is suggested that this style of broad regional uplift without significant deformation is characteristic of a tectonic regime associated with, and subsequent to, continental rifting.  Apatite fission track analysis is shown to be a basic tool in providing fundamental limits for thermal history assessment in regional tectonic problems.},

Red tides occur in the same area (approximately 26–29°N, 82–83°W) almost every year, but the intense 2005 bloom led to a widespread hypoxic zone (dissolved oxygen <2 mg L−1) that caused mortalities of benthic communities, fish, turtles, birds, and marine mammals. Runoff alone provided insufficient nitrogen to support this bloom. We pose the hypothesis that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) provides the missing nutrients, and indeed can trigger and support the recurrent red tides off west-central Florida. SGD inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in Tampa Bay alone are ∼35% of that discharged by all central Florida rivers draining west combined. We propose that the unusual number of hurricanes in 2004 resulted in high runoff, and in higher than normal SGD emerging along the west Florida coast throughout 2005, initiating and fueling the persistent HAB. This mechanism may also explain recurrent red tides in other coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico.},

The special considerations made to represent coupled transport processes at the basin scale are emphasized.

The amount of land subsidence or groundwater recovery from compressible confining layers depends upon the specific storage of the strata and the average head change within them. Expressions for the specific storage are obtained from both consolidation theory and conservation principles of compressible flow. Average head changes are identified on a depth-pressure diagram in terms of head changes in adjacent aquifers and are referred to as &#8216;effective-pressure areas.&#8217; The geometry of the effective-pressure area is shown to depend upon the thickness of the compressible strata, the magnitude of artesian pressure decline, the manner in which the basin is developed, and time. These factors are embodied in equations that quantitatively describe the release of stored water from compressible confining layers resulting from their vertical compression in areas of land subsidence.},

abstract = {Our basic knowledge of the geothermal potential in Belgium derives from existing geological reconnaissance surveys. As a result of the energy arises in the 1970s and early 1980s, efforts were made by public organisations such as the Belgian National Geological Survey and the Directorate-General for Science, Research and Development of the European Community to acquire further fundamental knowledge in the geological and technological fields related to the implementation of low-enthalpy geothermal projects. This led to the development of a low-enthalpy geothermal plant close to Mons in the south, and to a demonstration project for a doublet system in north Belgium. Following the drop in oil prices in the mid-eighties, there was a corresponding decrease in the efforts to develop geothermal installations. The resources of the potential areas identified in a previous work were assessed. This paper updates the resource assessment to the end of 1994 and describes the current, albeit limited, use of geothermal energy in Belgium.},

abstract = {The map of the surface heat flow in Europe was supplemented by the crustal thickness pattern and data on crustal radioactivity, and transformed to the mantle (Moho) heat flow distribution. Using a model of radioactivity decreasing exponentially with depth A(z)=A0 exp(-z/D), with A0=2[mu]Wm-3 and D=10km, we computed generalized one-dimensional, steady-state, conductive temperature-depth curves for the major tectonic units of Europe. The available information on the heat flow-tectonic age. heat flow-heat generation and heat flow-crustal thickness relationships were summarized and discussed in terms of crustal structure. The Mohorovicic discontinuity is clearly not an isothermal surface, neither is the outflow of heat from the upper mantle constant, but both parameters may vary within broad limits. The Moho-temperature can be as low as 280[degree sign]C in the shield areas; however, it can exceed 900[degree sign]C in some young intrarnontane depressions or rift structures. Regional variations of the Moho heat flow can be as large as 30-40 mWm-2. The value of the Moho-temperature reflects primarily the tectonic stabilization of the crust as a result of the deep-seated processes in the upper mantle.},

abstract = {Young (< 5??kyr) olivine- and clinopyroxene-phyric ne-hawaiites from Mounts Gambier and Schank in the Newer Volcanic Province in South Australia have been analysed for major and trace elements as well as for Sr and Nd isotopes and 238U-230Th disequilibria in order to constrain the mantle melting processes responsible for their origin. The rocks are relatively primitive (6.9-9.1% MgO), incompatible trace element-enriched alkali basalts with 87Sr/86Sr = 0.70398-0.70415 and 143Nd/144Nd = 0.51280-0.51271. Trace element modelling suggests that they reflect 3-6% partial melting in the presence of 2-8% residual garnet. Trends towards low K/K* are accompanied by decreasing 87Sr/86Sr and provide evidence for the involvement of hydrous phases during melting. 230Th excesses of 12-57% cannot be simulated by batch melting of the lithosphere and instead require dynamic melting models. It is argued that the distinction between continental basalts bearing significant U-Th disequilibria and those in secular equilibrium reflects dynamic melting in upwelling asthenosphere, rather than static batch melting within the lithosphere or the presence or absence of residual garnet. Upwelling rates are estimated at ??? 1.5??cm/yr. A subdued, localised topographic uplift associated with the magmatism suggests that any upwelling is more likely associated with a secondary mode localised to the upper mantle, rather than a broad zone of deeply-sourced (plume) upwelling. Upper mantle, 'edge-driven' convection is consistent with seismic tomographic and anisotropy studies that imply rapid differential motion of variable thickness Australian lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere. In this scenario, melting is linked to a significant contribution from hydrous mantle that is envisaged as resulting either from convective entrainment of lithosphere along the trailing edge of a lithospheric keel, or inherited variability in the asthenosphere. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {<p>The way faults control upward fluid flow in nonmagmatic hydrothermal systems in extensional context is still unclear. In the Eastern Pyr{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}es, an alignment of twenty-nine hot springs (29°C to 73°C), along the normal T{\^{e}}t fault, offers the opportunity to study this process. Using an integrated multiscale geological approach including mapping, remote sensing, and macro- and microscopic analyses of fault zones, we show that emergence is always located in crystalline rocks at gneiss-metasediments contacts, mostly in the T{\^{e}}t fault footwall. The hot springs distribution is related to high topographic reliefs, which are associated with fault throw and segmentation. In more detail, emergence localizes either (1) in brittle fault damage zones at the intersection between the T{\^{e}}t fault and subsidiary faults or (2) in ductile faults where dissolution cavities are observed along foliations, allowing juxtaposition of metasediments. Using these observations and 2D simple numerical simulation, we propose a hydrogeological model of upward hydrothermal flow. Meteoric fluids, infiltrated at high elevation in the fault footwall relief, get warmer at depth because of the geothermal gradient. Topography-related hydraulic gradient and buoyancy forces cause hot fluid rise along permeability anisotropies associated with lithological juxtapositions, fracture, and fault zone compositions.</p>},

abstract = {The migration of abnormally warm, saline water through the Appalachian basin and North American midcontinent in Paleozoic time has been inferred from fluid inclusion studies, remagnetizations, and widespread potassic alteration. A time-dependent numerical model of fluid, heat and solute transport is used to evaluate the viability of topographically driven recharge as a mechanism for brine migration. The model represents a wedge-shaped sedimentary basin 400 km long by 6 km deep (maximum) with a basal aquifer 500 to 750 m thick overlain by a homogeneous aquitard. Temperature predicted by model simulations is found to be inconsistent with constraints inferred from fluid inclusion studies, unless average heat flow values greater than about 100 mW/m2 are used. Model simulations also lead to predictions of low heat flow and subsurface temperaure in recharge zones that are generally not observed in modern orogenic zones. The initial solute content of pore waters in the model basin is flushed out by fresh water entering in the recharge zone before fluid velocities high enough to produce significant warming of the discharge zone can develop. Model simulations with source terms reveal that basin sediments can provide enough solute to maintain hot, hypersaline brine migration for about 1 m.y., at most. High fluid velocity in the basal aquifer is required to carry heat to the basin margins, but the higher the fluid velocity, the more quickly the basin's supply of solute is exhausted. Consideration of these constraints implies that topographically driven recharge may be an effective mechanism to explain regional brine migration only if flow is focused from regional scale recharge zones into more spatially restricted discharge zones.},

abstract = {Heating due to lateral introduction of hot fluids is becoming an increasingly recognized feature of the thermal histories of sedimentary basins. In some basins, heating by fluids may have an important effect on hydrocarbon source rock maturation history, so that quantification of the magnitude and timing of heating become essential elements in hydrocarbon prospectivity. In other cases, determining the time of fluid heating in a reservoir may provide a key constraint on hydrocarbon migration history. Examples are presented using AFTA apatite fission track analysis and vitrinite reflectance (VR) data to identify and quantify fluid heating in well sequences from several regions. In the West of Shetland region, in the vicinity of the Rona Ridge, non-linear palaeotemperature profiles defined by AFTA and VR results provide evidence of local heating shallow in the section. AFTA timing constraints suggest introduction of heated fluids produced by nearby Tertiary intrusive activity, although the time constraints are broad because of the low maximum palaeotemperatures involved (R0max \textless 0.6%). In a well from Asia, transient maximum palaeotemperatures \textgreater 120degreesC resulted in R0max \textgreater 0.6% in an Eocene section, with AFTA constraining the fluid flow event responsible for the early to mid Miocene (25 to 10 Ma). On the North West Shelf of Australia transient fluid flow associated with hydrocarbon leakage, and possibly charge, has been previously identified by a combination of AFTA, VR and fluid inclusion homogenization temperature (Th) results. In the East Swan-2 well, a fracture inclusion in quartz from shallow Eocene sandstones gives a minimum Th value of 88degreesC, c. 40degreesC higher than the present temperature. AFTA and VR data show no direct evidence of sustained heating at such a temperature, and can only be reconciled if the duration of heating was c. 20 000 years. The results are consistent with this event being associated with passage of a hot brine and hydrocarbon fluid (O'Brien and Woods, 1995). These case studies demonstrate that a combination of thermal history tools can be used to identify and quantify the thermal effect of fluid flow, potentially allowing much tighter constraints on hydrocarbon generation and migration histories.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Three commonly used methods for estimating static formation temperatures were evaluated: (1) the line-source or Horner method; (2) the spherical and radial heat-flow method; and (3) and the cylindrical heat-source method. Ordinary least-squares linear regression model statistical tests (sequence of signs, regression using sequential subsets of an ordered array of data, and residual sum of squares) were used to evaluate the actual relationship between the bottom-hole temperature and the time functions of the methods. The statistical tests for linearity and the resulting residual sum of squares show that bottom-hole temperature versus time-function relationships are of polynomial type. Standard deviation values of the slope and intercept were calculated for the linear as well as the quadratic regression model. The quadratic regression was found to be most appropriate for this purpose and was used for the first time for calculating static formation temperatures using four data sets of actual geothermal borehole logs and two synthetic sets. The F- and Student-t tests were applied to static formation temperatures obtained from linear and quadratic regression methods. Static formation temperatures computed with the spherical and radial heat-flow method are significantly greater (at the 95 per cent confidence level) than those from the other two methods under study. The spherical and radial heat-flow method seems to overestimate 'true' values of the static formation temperatures by about 10 per cent, whereas the other two methods (Horner and cylindrical heat source) provide unbiased estimates of these temperatures.},

abstract = {Four models of fission track annealing in apatite are compared with measured fission track lengths in samples from Site 800 in the East Mariana Basin, Ocean Drilling Program Leg 129, given an independently determined temperature history. The temperature history of Site 800 was calculated using a one-dimensional, compactive, conductive heat flow model assuming two end-member thermal cases: one for cooling of Jurassic ocean crust that has experienced no subsequent heating, and one for cooling of Cretaceous ocean crust. Because the samples analyzed were only shallowly buried and because the tectonic history of the area since sample deposition is simple, resolution of the temperature history is high. The maximum temperature experienced by the sampled bed is between 16°-21°C and occurs at 96 Ma; temperatures since the Cretaceous have dropped in spite of continued pelagic sediment deposition because heat flow has continued to decay exponentially and bottom-water temperatures have dropped. Fission tracks observed within apatite grains from the sampled bed are 14.6 ±0.1 µm (l$\sigma$) long. Given the proposed temperature history of the samples, one unpublished and three published models of fission track annealing predict mean track lengths from 14.8 to 15.9 µm. These models require temperatures as much as 40°C higher than the calculated paleotemperature maximum of the sampled bed to produce the same degree of track annealing. Measured and predicted values are different because annealing models are based on extrapolation of high temperature laboratory data to geologic times. The model that makes the closest prediction is based on the greatest number of experiments performed at low temperature and on an apatite having composition closest to that of the core samples.},

Four main episodes can be distinguished: a warm period around 0 AD, extended cold conditions in the 6-16th centuries, a general warming culminated near 1850 and the cooling since then. The verification of the GST assessment was accomplished by independent data from historical sources and the GST reconstructions in surrounding Slovakia and Slovenia. The long cold conditions in the Middle Ages and the absence of the Little Climatic Optimum seem to be generic feature of the climate in Hungary. In their more recent parts, the obtained GST histories are consistent with the meteorological records in the area.},

The main border fault zones of the RVRS, the Peel Boundary and the Feldbiss Fault zones, have been active during the Quaternary and are still active today, as indicated by the occurrence of earthquakes. In this paper we present the results of a trench across the Feldbiss Fault, part of the Feldbiss Fault zone. This trench provided no evidence for earthquakes along this segment of the fault zone; fluidization structures were not encountered. A sudden increase in the average fault displacement rate was inferred for the period around 15 ka B P in a trench nearby, across the Geleen Fault of the same fault zone. The (limited) age control cannot exclude that such an acceleration also occurred at the Feldbiss Fault. During the second half of the 1990's several paleoseismological trenching studies have been carried out in the RVRS. The compilation of the results of these studies reveals that the main border faults possibly experienced an increase in fault activity around 10-15 ka B P. The timing of this increased activity and results from glacial rebound modelling indicate that glacial unloading of the crust can have triggered this increase in fault activity.},

The effective closure temperature for fission tracks in apatite is $\sim$ 100�C, but recent developments in projected track length studies also allow us the dating of the $\sim$ 60�C cooling temperature. Projected track length measurements were carried out on apatites from the basement granites of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM), southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, where a previous study had revealed an uplifted, fossil partial annealing zone (PAZ). These measurements confirm the original conclusions reached, namely, that the break in slope in the apatite age profile represents the base of an uplifted PAZ. Furthermore this study provides a test case for not only the PAZ concept in interpretations of apatite age profiles, but also for the use of projected track lengths in determining the $\sim$ 60�C cooling temperature. It is therefore possible to locate the-position of the base and top of a fossil PAZ by use of the $\sim$ 100 and $\sim$ 60�C cooling ages. Model predictions of the PAZ concept for tectonics indicate that the break in slope, such as seen in the TAM, only approximates the onset of uplift. The true time of initiation of uplift was somewhat earlier because samples uplifted from near the base of the fossil PAZ are further annealed as they pass through the PAZ to the zone of full track stability.},

annote = {A methodology is presented for the prediction of fission-track parameters in geological situations from a laboratory-based description of annealing kinetics. To test the validity of extrapolation from laboratory to geological timescales, the approach is applied to a number of geological situations for which apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA) data are available and where thermal history is known with some confidence. Predicted fission-track parameters agree well with observation in all cases, giving confidence in the validity of the extrapolation, and suggesting that fission-track annealing takes place by a single pathway in both laboratory and geological conditions. The precision of predicted track lengths is considered in some detail. Typical levels of precision are \textasciitilde �0.5 [mu]m for mean lengths [precedes, approximate] 10 [mu]m, and \textasciitilde �0.3 [mu]m for length [greater, approximate] 10 [mu]m. Precision is largely independent of thermal history for any reasonable geological thermal history. Accuracy of prediction is limited principally by the effect of apatite composition on annealing kinetics. The development of fission-track parameters is illustrated through a series of notional thermal histories to emphasise various key aspects of the response of the system. Temperature dominates over time in determining final fission-track parameters, with an order of magnitude increase in time being equivalent to a \textasciitilde 10�C increase in temperature. The final length of a track is determined predominantly by the maximum temperature to which it is subjected. Aspects of AFTA response are further highlighted by prediction of patterns of AFTA parameters as a function of depth and temperature from a series of notional burial histories embodying a variety of thermal history styles. The quantitative understanding of AFTA response not only affords the basis of rigorous paleotemperature estimation, but also allows a better understanding of the situations in which AFTA can be applied to yield useful information.},

abstract = {A 2D integrated finite difference model of coupled fluid flow and heat transfer is presented for an area in northern Switzerland where crystalline basement is overlain by a Mesozoic/Tertiary sedimentary sequence. In this region the geothermal field is characterized by a strongly positive heat flow density anomaly (> 150 mW m−2). The anomaly is centered above a recently discovered Permocarboniferous trough. Several possibilities to explain the anomaly (thermal disturbance in the mantle, cooling shallow intrusion, locally strong uplift/erosion, local contrasts in petrophysical properties) can be ruled on in the basis of model calculations. Ascending deep groundwater is favored as the mechanism creating the observed anomaly. Deep groundwater circulation was investigated in detail, especially to clarify the hydraulic role of the Permocarboniferous trough, by coupled thermo-hydraulic modeling. The model was calibrated to reproduce the data set of field measurements available to date. The following parameters were used: i) hydraulic potential of aquifers, ii) discharge rate and temperature of thermal springs, iii) surface heat flow density distribution, iv) subsurface temperature field (as constructed from drillhole data). The model so calibrated enables to delimit the depth range of deep groundwater circulation (∼ 8 km), and the derivation of mean permeabilites and Darcy velocities for various parts of the crystalline basement (on the average, 10−15 m2 and 10 mm/y, respectively, for the area studied).},

abstract = {We present a synoptic overview of the Mio- cene-present development of the northern Alpine foreland basin (Molasse Basin), with special attention to the pattern of surface erosion and sediment discharge in the Alps. Erosion of the Molasse Basin started at the same time that the rivers originating in the Central Alps were deflected toward the Bresse Graben, which formed part of the Euro- pean Cenozoic rift system. This change in the drainage direction decreased the distance to the marine base level by approximately 1,000 km, which in turn decreased the average topographic elevation in the Molasse Basin by at least 200 m. Isostatic adjustment to erosional unloading required ca. 1,000 m of erosion to account for this inferred topographic lowering. A further inference is that the resulting increase in the sediment discharge at the Miocene– Pliocene boundary reflects the recycling of Molasse units. We consider that erosion of the Molasse Basin occurred in response to a shift in the drainage direction rather than because of a change in paleoclimate. Climate left an imprint on the Alpine landscape, but presumably not before the beginning of glaciation at the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary. Similar to the northern Alpine foreland, we do not see a strong climatic fingerprint on the pattern or rates of exhumation of the External Massifs. In particular, the initiation and acceleration of imbrication and antiformal stacking of the foreland crust can be considered solely as a response to the convergence of Adria and Europe, irre- spective of erosion rates. However, the recycling of the Molasse deposits since 5 Ma and the associated reduction of the loads in the foreland could have activated basement thrusts beneath the Molasse Basin in order to restore a critical wedge. In conclusion, we see the need for a more careful consideration of both tectonic and climatic forcing on the development of the Alps and the adjacent Molasse Basin.},

abstract = {The Moab fault, a basin-scale normal fault that juxtaposes Jurassic eolian sandstone units against Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous shale and sandstone, is locally associated with extensive calcite and lesser quartz cement. We mapped the distribution of fault-related diagenetic alteration products relative to the fault structure to identify sealing and conductive fault segments for fluid flow and to relate fault-fluid-flow behavior to the internal architecture of the fault zone. Calcite cement occurs as vein and breccia cement along slip surfaces and as discontinuous vein cement and concretions in fault damage zones. The cement predominates along fault segments that are composed of joints, sheared joints, and breccias that overprint earlier deformation bands. Using the distribution of fault-related calcite cement as an indicator of paleofluid migration, we infer that fault-parallel fluid flow was focused along fault segments that were overprinted by joints and sheared joints. Joint density, and thus fault-parallel permeability, is highest at locations of structural complexity such as fault intersections, extensional steps, and fault-segment terminations. The association of calcite with remnant hydrocarbons suggests that calcite precipitation was mediated by the degradation and microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons. We propose that the discontinuous occurrence of microbially mediated calcite cement may impede, but not completely seal, fault-parallel fluid flow. Fault-perpendicular flow, however, is mostly impeded by the juxtaposition of the sandstone units against shale and by shale entrainment. The Moab fault thus exemplifies the complex interaction of fault architecture and diagenetic sealing processes in controlling the hydraulic properties of faults in clastic sequences.},

The southern Wassuk Range (WR) hanging wall hosts a moderate-temperature, extensional-type geothermal system and is ideal for studying this duality by analyzing a suite of apatite (AHe) and zircon (ZHe) helium samples from the footwall and hanging wall of the southern WR. Young ($\sim$. 3-4. Ma) AHe ages along the WR front are concentrated along the SE corners of segmented footwall blocks, marking the location of focused Mio-Pliocene transtension, fracture dilation, and advection. Hydrothermally reset AHe ages along the footwall range front suggest that the Hawthorne geothermal system (85??-135??. C) is long lived and has resided at a prominent structural boundary in the WR footwall marked by localized advection and range-front deformation. In contrast, the presence of both hydrothermally reset and non-reset AHe ages from a $\sim$. 1.4. km deep borehole in the hanging-wall basin probably indicate that the geothermal plumbing system and current manifestation as a thermal anomaly ($\sim$. 113. ??C) are juvenile and are controlled by the generation of newly formed faults in the hanging wall. AHe ages have been shown here to greatly enhance the focusing of regional-scale geothermal exploration efforts, and for the first time have been used to identify and estimate the temperature of unseen hydrothermal fluids. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {High-precision stepped-heating experiments were performed to better characterize helium diffusion from apatite using Durango fluorapatite as a model system. At temperatures below 265{\o}C, helium diffusion from this apatite is a simple, thermally activated process that is independent of the cumulative fraction of helium released and also of the heating schedule used. Across a factor of -4 in grain size, helium diffusivity scales with the inverse square of grain radius, implying that the physical grain is the diffusion domain. Measurements on crystallographically oriented thick sections indicate that helium diffusivity in Durango apatite is nearly isotropic. The best estimate of the activation energy for He diffusion from this apatite is E a = 33 _+ 0.5 kcal/mol, with log(D0) = 1.5 +_ 0.6 cm2/s. The implied He closure temperature for a grain of 100 •m radius is 68{\o}C assuming a 10{\o}C/Myr cooling rate; this figure varies by _5{\o}C for grains ranging from 50 to 150 •m radius. When this apatite is heated to temperatures from 265 to 400{\o}C, a progressive and irreversible change in He diffusion behavior occurs: Both the activation energy and frequency factor are reduced. This transition in behavior coincides closely with progressive annealing of radiation damage in Durango apatite, suggesting that defects and defect annealing play a role in the diffusivity of helium through apatite.},

Therefore, in 1973 a control network with levelling profiles across the eastern Rhine Graben fault was installed and measured in the vicinity of the city of Basel in order to measure relative vertical movements and investigate their relationship with seismic events. As a contribution to EUCOR-URGENT, the profiles were observed a third time in the years 2002 and 2003 and connected to the Swiss national levelling network. The results of these local measurements are discussed in terms of accuracy and significance. Furthermore, they are combined and interpreted together with the extensive data set of recent vertical movements in Switzerland (Jura Mountains, Central Plateau and the Alps). In order to be able to prove height changes with precise levelling, their values should amount to at least 3–4 mm (1$\sigma$). The present investigations, however, have not shown any significant vertical movements over the past 30 years.},

abstract = {Extensional-type geothermal systems are complicated by the interrelation between footwall advection during exhumation, and the subsequent redistribution of heat by migrating hydrothermal fluids in the hanging wall. The southern Wassuk Range (WR) hanging wall hosts a moderate-temperature, extensional-type geothermal system and is ideal for studying this duality by analyzing a suite of apatite (AHe) and zircon (ZHe) helium samples from the footwall and hanging wall of the southern WR. Young ($\sim$. 3-4. Ma) AHe ages along the WR front are concentrated along the SE corners of segmented footwall blocks, marking the location of focused Mio-Pliocene transtension, fracture dilation, and advection. Hydrothermally reset AHe ages along the footwall range front suggest that the Hawthorne geothermal system (85??-135??. C) is long lived and has resided at a prominent structural boundary in the WR footwall marked by localized advection and range-front deformation. In contrast, the presence of both hydrothermally reset and non-reset AHe ages from a $\sim$. 1.4. km deep borehole in the hanging-wall basin probably indicate that the geothermal plumbing system and current manifestation as a thermal anomaly ($\sim$. 113. ??C) are juvenile and are controlled by the generation of newly formed faults in the hanging wall. AHe ages have been shown here to greatly enhance the focusing of regional-scale geothermal exploration efforts, and for the first time have been used to identify and estimate the temperature of unseen hydrothermal fluids. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Misconceptions regarding the fission track dating method prompt the description of five handling procedures and the derivation of commonly used system calibrations. Problems of registration geometry, inhomogeneous uranium distribution, accumulated radiation damage and anisotropic etching largely invalidate all but the population and external detector methods, and impose strict limitations upon even their routine application. Complexities of unique, absolute thermal neutron dosimetry are illustrated by the calibration and use of the NBS pre-irradiated glass SRM 962. The 20% disparity in measured [lambda]f decay constant values cannot be isolated from neutron fluence ([phi]) measurement and calibration. Frequently a calibration ratio ([phi]/[lambda]f) is evaluated against an age standard and then split into its component parts. To illustrate this interdependence of [lambda]f and [phi], zircon fission track ages, in agreement with independent KAr ages, are obtained by calculating the same track count data with each of the preferred values of [lambda]f ([lambda]f = 7.03 � 10-17yr-1and8.46 � 10-17yr-1) together with appropriate, selected neutron dosimetry schemes. An alternative approach is presented, formally relating unknown ages of samples to known ages of standards, either by direct comparison of standard and sample track densities, or by the repeated calibration of a glass against age standards. Practical recommendations are given for the reporting and critical assessment of fission track data.},

abstract = {Abstract A set of ash layer samples within the uppermost Upper Freshwater Molasse (OSM) sediments (N and E of Frauenfeld, Switzerland)\nwas dated by apatite fission track (FT) means. The ages indicate an early Tortonian (perhaps latest Serravallian) eruption\nand sedimentation age of 11.5 ± 0.3 Ma. The age is in agreement with time constraints by Mammalian relicts which point to\nMN7-8. Due to the position of the ash layers close to the erosional gap and overlying Quaternary cover, the age represents\na maximum age for the cessation of OSM sedimentation in the Swiss Molasse Basin. However, the end of Molasse sedimentation\nin this region had not stopped before the cover of OSM sediments by volcanic ash layers at the H{\"{o}}wenegg volcano (southern\nGermany), an event further constrained by an apatite FT age of 9.8 (−0.7/+0.8) Ma from a hornblende-bearing ash layer at H{\"{o}}wenegg.\nAn isolated bentonitic ash layer occurring 25 km to the WSW of the main set of dated ashes (near Humlikon) has an age component\nidentical to the OSM ash layers near Frauenfeld. The age suggests a source for this material within the Hegau, but is too\nyoung to be related to the volcanic activity at the Kaiserstuhl.\n\nThe apatites from the ash layer samples show two distinct compositional populations, one very close to a Cl end member and\none with apatites of equal proportions of Cl and OH end member. These populations are interpreted to have possibly originated\nfrom at least two distinct igneous sources for the ashes, separated by their eruption site or eruption time or both. The distinct\ncompositional data on the volcanic apatites may provide a basis to clarify their origin in future work.},

abstract = {We propose an accurate, fast and easy-to-use method to derive numerical solutions for production–diffusion equations for finite diffusion domains of various shapes and arbitrary cooling histories. Previous studies provide solutions for spheres, infinite cylinders and infinite sheets. We extend this range and provide solutions for finite bodies, i.e. finite cylinders and rectangular blocks of any aspect ratio. This approach is important as recently, it has become clear that, for example, the physical grain is the diffusion domain for He diffusion in apatite and titanite [J. Geophys. Res. 105 (2000) 2903; Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 63 (1999) 3845]. We discuss the use of the new approach for forward modelling (U–Th)/He production–diffusion in apatite. Taking results with finite cylinders as a good approximation for apatite crystals, it is found that approximating instead with spheres or infinite cylinders having the same radius yields differences in calculated ages that can easily be as large as 20–35%. The relative differences are most pronounced in thermal histories that spend significant time at or near the closure temperature. On the other hand, reasonable agreement is found with spheres having the same surface to volume ratio. D},

abstract = {The main aim of this project is the preparation of a specific data base of geothermal properties for typi- cal rocks of the Swiss Molasse Basin (depth interval 0- 500 m). The project includes the development of a new laboratory tool for efficient heat capacity measurements on rock samples, numerous new meas- urements of geothermal rock properties in the laboratory and calculation of such data from geophysical borehole logs. Within the study area (Fig. 1) 282 rock samples, mainly from deep boreholes, were analyzed with the successfully calibrated new heat capacity device and conventional thermal conductivity measuring tech- niques (cuttings and cores). Based on sonic and density log data from exploration wells, 374 additional data points were generated. This new data base (Appendix 4, upgraded and revised in 2006) characterizes in detail the six main lithological rock types in the three Molasse groups OSM, OMM and USM within the Swiss Plateau Mo- lasse. The statistical evaluation of all data illustrates the regional variation of the petrophysical and geo- thermal parameters. Bulk rock density and thermal conductivity increase, whereas heat capacity de- creases in the direction towards the Alpine front for most data groups (Appendix 5). Thermal conductiv- ity shows a distinct increase with depth. Based on this new information and with the aid of the evaluation software tool SwEWS (Leu et al. 2006), the costs of planned geothermal installations can be optimized by more precise heat extraction simula- tions with existing software packages like COSOND, TRNSYS, EWS or WPcalc.},

abstract = {The duration of hydrothermal activity required to form ore deposits is poorly constrained. We demonstrate that thermochronology data, coupled with thermal modeling, can be used to constrain the duration of hydrothermal fluid flow. Apatite fission-track (AFT) thermochronology data define a conductive halo around an Eocene hydrothermal system that formed the Betze-Post gold deposit on the northern Carlin trend in Nevada. The premineralization Goldstrike stock acted as an essentially impermeable side to the auriferous Carlin hydrothermal system. The hydrothermal fluid conductively heated the intrusion over the time that it flowed past it. To derive first-order estimates for the maximum duration of this flow we numerically modeled one-dimensional conductive heat flow into the intrusion and used the results to forward model ensuing AFT annealing. Modeled levels of annealing were compared to AFT dates and track length data measured across the intrusion. Our results indicate that the episode of main ore-stage hydrothermal fluid flow (mean temperature of 200°C) that formed the $\sim$1,150 metric ton (t) Betze-Post gold deposit had a maximum duration of <15 to 45 ka. The average gold flux over this period was $\sim$80 to 30 kg yr−1, comparable to that measured in the deep reservoirs of several modern geothermal fields. Conservative estimates of gold concentration in the main ore-stage fluids imply that fluid upflow rates and total advective heat flow were also comparable to modern geothermal systems. This suggests that the most important factors for generating the large gold deposits of the northern Carlin trend were a large and/or continuous source of gold, and a very efficient means of removing it from the fluid, rather than the hydrologic system itself. The short duration of main ore-stage fluid flow is unlikely to represent a steady-state convective system. Instead, it most likely reflects a transient period of flow following slip and permeability generation along the steeply dipping Post-Genesis fault system that hosts many of the deposits along the northern Carlin trend. A sudden increase in the permeability of a fault may have led to a transitory period of peak fluid temperature as the fault initially tapped meteoric fluid that had resided at depth and had thermally equilibrated with the host rocks. With continued convection the flow drew cooler, less rock-buffered meteoric water down from higher in the system.},

abstract = {In this paper, numerical methods derived in Part I (Chem. Geol. (2002)) are expanded to accommodate the effects of a- emission and zonation of U and Th as relevant for (U–Th)/He thermochronology. Expressions for the required coefficients are derived for spheres, finite and infinite cylinders and rectangular blocks, for parent nuclide distributions, which are either uniform or have stepwise zoning. We show that the effects of a-emission and zonation on the He retention in a nonspherical crystal of modest aspect ratio can be approximated by a sphere of identical surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) if the zonation is transposed on to the sphere. The currently usual correction method is to perform first a diffusive calculation without considering a-emission and zonation and to multiply afterward with a correction factor that has been derived originally for nondiffusive calculations. Our results demonstrate that more accurate calculations yield different results and that the differences are often too large to be ignored in practice. Especially for thermal histories that include a protracted residence in the partial retention zone, the difference between the usual correction and our correction can be as high as f20% for homogeneous sources. For zoned crystals, the difference can be even larger.},

abstract = {Recent work [Shuster D. L., Flowers R. M. and Farley K. A. (2006) The influence of natural radiation damage on helium diffusion kinetics in apatite. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 249(3-4), 148-161] revealing a correlation between radiogenic 4He concentration and He diffusivity in natural apatites suggests that helium migration is retarded by radiation-induced damage to the crystal structure. If so, the He diffusion kinetics of an apatite is an evolving function of time and the effective uranium concentration in a cooling sample, a fact which must be considered when interpreting apatite (U-Th)/He ages. Here we report the results of experiments designed to investigate and quantify this phenomenon by determining He diffusivities in apatites after systematically adding or removing radiation damage. Radiation damage was added to a suite of synthetic and natural apatites by exposure to between 1 and 100 h of neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor. The samples were then irradiated with a 220 MeV proton beam and the resulting spallogenic 3He used as a diffusant in step-heating diffusion experiments. In every sample, irradiation increased the activation energy (Ea) and the frequency factor (Do/a2) of diffusion and yielded a higher He closure temperature (Tc) than the starting material. For example, 100 h in the reactor caused the He closure temperature to increase by as much as 36 ??C. For a given neutron fluence the magnitude of increase in closure temperature scales negatively with the initial closure temperature. This is consistent with a logarithmic response in which the neutron damage is additive to the initial damage present. In detail, the irradiations introduce correlated increases in Ea and ln(Do/a2) that lie on the same array as found in natural apatites. This strongly suggests that neutron-induced damage mimics the damage produced by U and Th decay in natural apatites. To investigate the potential consequences of annealing of radiation damage, samples of Durango apatite were heated in vacuum to temperatures up to 550 ??C for between 1 and 350 h. After this treatment the samples were step-heated using the remaining natural 4He as the diffusant. At temperatures above 290 ??C a systematic change in Tc was observed, with values becoming lower with increasing temperature and time. For example, reduction of Tc from the starting value of 71 to ???52 ??C occurred in 1 h at 375 ??C or 10 h at 330 ??C. The observed variations in Tc are strongly correlated with the fission track length reduction predicted from the initial holding time and temperature. Furthermore, like the neutron irradiated apatites, these samples plot on the same Ea - ln(Do/a2) array as natural samples, suggesting that damage annealing is simply undoing the consequences of damage accumulation in terms of He diffusivity. Taken together these data provide unequivocal evidence that at these levels, radiation damage acts to retard He diffusion in apatite, and that thermal annealing reverses the process. The data provide support for the previously described radiation damage trapping kinetic model of Shuster et al. (2006) and can be used to define a model which fully accommodates damage production and annealing. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the population method, sampling of non-homogeneous uranium distributions introduces experimental error. In the external detector method (EDM), many factors exist to introduce such error. Simply quoting total numbers of spontaneous and induced fission tracks obtained by the EDM may disguise the possible influence of experimental variation. The present work concentrates on the EDM, and describes a test which has recently been proposed to detect the presence of experimental error in EDM analyses. The question of an alternative analysis for cases where such error is present is also considered. A method of presenting EDM data is suggeted, which allows assessment of the importance of experimental errors.},

The onset of rapid extension is denoted by an abrupt change, at c. 22–21 Ma, in cooling rate derived from age-closure temperature plots, and in slope of age-distance gradients in footwalls. Linear age-distance trends with slopes of c. 3–8 km Ma−1, for low-temperature thermochronometers, give time-averaged displacement rates on detachment faults. Gradients of mineral age across thick tilted hanging wall fault blocks reveal palaeotemperature gradients when the angle of tilting is known. Pre-extensional thermal gradients for tilted blocks in the southern Basin and Range province were c. 20–25°C km−1, 17° ± 5°C km−1, and c. 20–24°C km−1. Thermochronological data from the footwall of the Chemehuevi detachment fault reveal a trend of increasing temperature, in the known slip direction, from ≤200° to 350–400°C over an exposed distance of 23 km, at the onset of extension. The gradual increase in temperature constrains the Chemehuevi detachment fault to have had an original dip of c. 15–30°, within the brittle upper crust. },

In all annealed samples the mean confined track length is always less than that in unannealed control samples. As annealing progresses, the mean length is reduced and the length distribution broadens, slowly at first, and then more rapidly below a length reduction (l/l0) of \textasciitilde 0.65. In addition, the variation of track length with angle to the crystallographic c-axis becomes progressively more anisotropic. As the mean track length approaches zero, the only tracks left are aligned parallel to the c-acis. In heavily annealed samples (l/l0 \textless 0.65) observation of individual tracks after sequential etching steps shows the presence of unetchable "gaps" in a small proportion of tracks. The existence of these gaps is borne out by annealing studies of heavy-ion tracks in apatite slices. These studies also show the anisotropy characteristic of annealing in apatite. The annealing of fission tracks in apatite appears to be characterised by two processes. For small degrees of annealing the dominant process brings about a progressive shrinking of the track from each end, with tracks perpendicular to the c-axis shortening more rapidly than those parallel to it. As annealing becomes more severe (l/l0 \textless 0.65) the tracks begin to break up into discontinuous portions. Track length distributions in annealed apatites reflect the interplay of these processes. The effect of apatite composition on annealing has been studied using spontaneous tracks in apatites from a sample in which considerable geological annealing has occurred. Electron microprobe studies show that apatite grains rich in Cl are more resistant to annealing, while fluorapatite is more readily annealed.},

abstract = {While initial studies showed a high degree of consistency between AFTA and apatite (U-Th)/He dating, an increasing number of studies are reporting apatite (U-Th)/He ages which are older than expected on the basis of apatite fission track data from the same region. We present data from a range of geological settings to document a systematic discrepancy between the two systems, which becomes more pronounced in samples with older fission track ages (except for samples with very low uranium contents). Results from a granite pebble and enclosing volcanogenic sandstone provide a well-controlled test case in which independent constraints are available on the underlying thermal history. These demonstrate that the progressive discrepancy between the two techniques arises not from anomalous fission track annealing behaviour, as has been suggested, but as a result of a change in the He retention properties of apatite. This change appears to be linked to the degree of accumulated radiation damage within the crystal lattice, although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We suggest detailed experiments should be performed to delineate and quantify the processes responsible. Until this is achieved, we suggest that apatite (U-Th)/He studies should also incorporate apatite fission track data, as well as other low temperature indicators, in order to monitor the (U-Th)/He system response and to guard against the anomalous behaviour described here.},

abstract = {Stepwise degassing diffusion experiments on 39 different apatite samples using radiogenic 4He and proton-induced 3He reveal a range in closure temperature (Tc) from ?????50 to 115????C, for a cooling rate of 10????C/Myr. There is no correlation between helium diffusion and apatite chemistry including F/Cl ratio, but the closure temperature is positively correlated with the radiogenic 4He concentration ([4He]) in each sample. We argue that [4He] is a proxy for a sample's natural exposure to actinide radioactivity below the closure temperature, and that helium diffusion in apatite is impeded by radiation-induced damage to the apatite structure. The kinetics must therefore be an evolving function of time; measured diffusivities thus reflect a snapshot in time and cannot alone be applied to the thermochronometric interpretation of a given sample. The effect of radiation damage on helium diffusion appears to far exceed other known controls on helium diffusivity, including grain size. Our diffusion data are well described by a previously proposed, quantitative model that consists of two Arrhenius relations, one for volume diffusion through undamaged mineral structure and one for release of helium from radiation damage "traps." The unknown parameters in this "trapping model" were determined from the diffusion experiments, and allow us to develop a tentative mathematical function that relates diffusivity to temperature and [4He]. By inserting this function into a 4He production-diffusion model we have explored how these results affect the interpretation of apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry. The model predicts that the effective 4He closure temperature of apatite will vary with cooling rate and effective U concentration (eU) and may differ from the commonly assumed Tc of 70????C by up to ?? 15????C. The 4He partial retention zone will look similar to previous expectations, but its depth will depend on accumulation time and on eU. Most notably, samples subjected to reheating after accumulation of substantial radiation damage will be more retentive than previously expected. These predictions are consistent with recent observations of unexpected apatite (U-Th)/He ages in some settings. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

AHe and ZHe data record two episodes of rapid cooling related to the tectonic exhumation of the WR fault block beginning at $\sim$15 and $\sim$4 Ma. Extension was accommodated through fault-block rotation and variably tilted the southern WR to the west from $\sim$60°–70° in the central WR to $\sim$15°–35° in the southernmost WR and Pine Grove Hills, and minimal tilting in the Anchorite Hills and along the Mina Deflection to the south. Middle Miocene geothermal gradient estimates record heating immediately prior to large-magnitude extension that was likely coeval with the extrusion of the Lincoln Flat andesite at $\sim$14.8 Ma. Geothermal gradients increase from $\sim$19° ± 4°C/km to ≥ 65° ± 20°C/km toward the Mina Deflection, suggesting that it was the focus of Middle Miocene arc magmatism in the upper crust. The decreasing thickness of tilt blocks toward the south resulted from a shallowing brittle/ductile transition zone. Postmagmatic Middle Miocene extension and fault-block advection were focused in the northern and central WR and coincidentally moderated the large lateral thermal gradient within the uppermost crust.},

annote = {The relationship between reduced track density, [varrho]/[varrho]0, and reduced mean confined track length, L/L0, during annealing has been studied for both spontaneous and induced tracks in four apatite samples with different chemical composition, compositional range, and origin, and with spontaneous tracks giving mean confined track lengths varying from \textasciitilde 14.5 [mu]m down to 12.3 [mu]m. In all four apatites, induced tracks show a relationship between L/L0 and [varrho]/[varrho]0 composed of two regions; at higher values the two appear to be equal, while at lower values L/L0 is greater than [varrho]/[varrho]0. This can be understood qualitatively in terms of the anisotropy of annealing and the bias against revelation of short tracks. Data from three apatites of uniform composition show near-identical relationships. In a sample showing a range of apatite compositions, the point of divergence from the 1:1 relationship is somewhat higher than in the uniform composition apatites, because individual grains anneal at different rates, and the presence of highly annealed grains affects the track density more strongly than the mean track length. Spontaneous tracks show similar relationships to those observed for induced tracks in each sample, when the data are renormalised to allow for the natural annealing present in the spontaneous tracks. Previous studies which led to the idea of length reduction without density reduction for spontaneous tracks did not renormalise density data as well as length data, thereby distorting the apparent relationship. Data for the multi-compositional apatite sample where annealing has taken place in geological conditions also agrees with the laboratory annealing data for both spontaneous and induced tracks. This consistency suggests that a single process is responsible in all three cases, implying that a laboratory-based description of annealing can be applied to geological conditions with confidence. Recognition that spontaneous tracks in apatite are commonly annealed suggests that, in general, the fission track age should be interpreted as a reflection of both the time over which tracks have been retained and the distribution of etchable track lengths. Since the latter is a manifestation of the thermal history, the fission track age should be interpreted in similar terms.},

abstract = {Thermochronologic data are typically interpreted as point- or path-wise constraints on monotonic cooling histories. This is at least partly because allowing for the possibility of nonmonotonic thermal histories both precludes straightfoward use of closure temperature (Tc) concepts and introduces ambiguities in modeling continuous time-temperature paths from multiple thermochronometers or closure profile, multi-domain, or fission-track length data. However, the monotonic cooling assumption severely limits the ability to elucidate reheating episodes with potentially important geologic significance. Here I show that in some cases multiple thermochronometers with contrasting kinetic properties can be used to both diagnose reheating events and constrain their duration and temperature. Thermochronometric systems with varying activation energies display "kinetic crossovers," whereby relative diffusivities are reversed at certain temperatures. For reheating events of certain durations and temperatures, this results in "inverted" ages, whereby systems with higher nominal Tcs have younger ages than systems with lower Tcs. However, even if reheating does not cause age inversion, in cases where two systems are partially reset and constraints on the timing of a reheating event are available, the relative fractional resetting extents can be inverted to estimate a square-pulse equivalent duration and temperature of the reheating event. Here I outline this approach for diagnosing nonmonotonic thermal histories and for deducing features of reheating events from thermochronometric data, and review several examples from previously published data that illustrate its use and potential in a range of applications. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) geologic model of part of the northern Nevada rift encompassing the Beowawe geothermal system was developed from a series of two-dimensional (2D) geologic and geophysical models. The 3D model was constrained by local geophysical, geologic, and drill-hole information and integrates geologic and tectonic interpretations for the region. It places important geologic constraints on the extent and configuration of the active Beowawe geothermal system. The geologic framework represented in this model facilitates hydrologic modeling of the Beowawe geothermal system and evaluation of fluid flow in faults and adjacent rock units. Basin depths were determined using an iterative gravity-inversion technique that calculates the thickness of low-density, basin-filling deposits. The remaining subsurface structure was modeled using 2D potential-field modeling software. Crustal cross sections from the 2D models were generalized for use in the 3D model and consist of six stratigraphic layers defined as low-density basin sediments, volcanic rocks, basalt-andesite rocks of the northern Nevada rift, Jurassic and Cretaceous intrusive rocks, and Paleozoic siliceous and carbonate sedimentary rocks of the upper and lower plates of the Roberts Mountains allochthon, respectively. This simplified stratigraphy was combined with mapped surface geology and was extrapolated across the 3D model area. Features along the northern Nevada rift depicted by the model may represent preexisting crustal structures that controlled the locations and character of Tertiary tectonic and magmatic events related to Basin and Range extension and emplacement of the middle Miocene northern Nevada rift. Several of the geologic features represented are important components of the Beowawe geothermal system. Prominent ENE-trending faults (e. g., Malpais fault) that bound the southern edge of Whirlwind Valley, and older NNW-striking faults (e.g., Dunphy Pass and Muleshoe faults) that form major features of the model, are likely important pathways for geothermal fluids and groundwater flow from the Humboldt River, which may recharge the Beowawe system.},
