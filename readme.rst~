Downloading pybasin
-------------------

* click the download link on the right for a zip file of the source code
* or clone the repository

Dependencies
------------

PyBasin requires the following packages to be installed:

- Python2.x_	Contributes the Py to PyBasin		 
- Numpy_	Fast arrays
- Pandas_	Reading model input and output and data processing
- Scipy_	Statistical and model calibration algorithms
- Matplotlib_	External library for making model result figures

.. _Python2.x: http://www.python.org/
.. _Numpy: http://www.scipy.org/NumPy
.. _Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org
.. _Scipy: http://www.scipy.org/
.. _Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/


Installing & running pybasin
----------------------------
* make sure you have installed the necessary python modules
* unzip the pybasin source code
* navigate to the pybasin folder and execute pybasin by executing the following command from the command line:

	>>> python pybasin.py
	

* the model will now run with the default input dataset from the Swiss Molasse Basin. Check the model output in the folder ``model_output/MB``
* the first time you run pybasin, you will have to compile the fission track annealing module. The fission track annealing module was written in fortran instead of python to reduce computation time. Compile the fortran file by navigatting to the subfolder `pybasin/lib``, opening a terminal and running the following command:

    f2py -c calculate_reduced_AFT_lengths.f -m calculate_reduced_AFT_lengths

* you may need to install a fortran compiler first. For linux operating systems this shoudl be included in your distribution, for mac osx you can find installers for gfortran here: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinariesMacOS


Model input & output
--------------------

input:
~~~~~~

* adjust the default location of the model input files by changing the file ``default_input_folder.txt``. The folder name specified in this file should be a subfolder of the folder ``pybasin/input_data``
* adjust the text files in the folder
* adjust the model parameters in the file ``pybasin_params.py``. Use a python editor like PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or Enthought Canopy (https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) or a text editor to adjust the model parameters. 

output:
~~~~~~~

* The model generates a series of .csv files that shows the stratrigraphy, burial depths and formation thicknesses over time. These files are stored in ``model_output/model_folder/burial_history_csv_files/``, where ``model_folder`` is the name of the input and output folder that you have specified in the file ``default_input_folder.txt``
* If ``make_model_data_fig = True`` in the file pybasin_params.py, the model script will generates a single figure for each model run showing burial depth, temperature and modeled vitrinite relfectacne and apatite fission track age data. THis figure is saved in the folder ``model_output/model_folder/model_data_fig/``
* If ``save_model_run_data = True`` in the file pybasin_params.py, the model script will store all model simulation data for each model run in a datafile that uses the python pickle module. THis file can be read later using a additional python script (still in the works...). The lcoation where these files should be saved is specified in the ``pybasin_params.py`` in line 19: ``datafile_output_dir = '../../heavy_data/pybasin_MB'``
